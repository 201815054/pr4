The plans will also create governance-related challenges for regulators, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wrote in its bi-annual financial stability report on Thursday.
Major technology firms ""straddle many different lines of business with sometimes opaque overarching governance structures,"" it said.
The RBI said concerns included operational risks, too-big-to fail issues, challenges for antitrust rules, cybersecurity and data privacy. But it added that positive outcomes could include efficiency gains and more access to financial services.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) currently provide basic payment services in India. Both companies as well Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others have applied for licences to operate broader retail payment and settlement systems in partnership with Indian companies such as Reliance and lenders.

The central bank's warnings come at a time of much tension between the Indian government and U.S. tech giants over issues that range from e-commerce rules to data privacy and content posted on their platforms. Amazon, Facebook, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Twitter have all been caught up in disputes with New Delhi. 
India's largest state-run bank and UNI Global Union which represents about 20 million workers globally last month also raised concerns about the entry of large tech companies into the country's payments sector.

Investing.com – Beigene Ltd. has received approval for an IPO on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR market, estimated to be worth around $3 billion.
The listing on the Chinese board would add to the company’s listings in the U.S. and Hong Kong, with a successful listing making Beigene the first biotech company to be listed in all three markets.
The STAR Market’s listing committee said that the proposed IPO met the market’s conditions and requirements for information disclosure, but stopped short of providing a timetable for the next steps. However, it added that Beigene will need to provide a further explanation on how it will adapt to the Chinese A-share market as well as how it will protect Chinese shareholders.
Beigene raised $182 million in Nasdaq in 2016 and $902 million in Hong Kong two years later.
The company’s Hong Kong shares (HK:6160) slid 2.75% to HK$ 205.40 ($26.45) at 11:18 PM ET (3:18 GMT), despite gaining more than 19% so far in 2021. Meanwhile, its U.S. shares (NASDAQ:BGNE) rose 1.88% to $349.65, and are up more than 31% in 2021.

The CSI 300 Index fell as much as 2.4%, the most since March 19. Liquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co. and China Merchants Bank Co. were among the top drags on the benchmark, each dropping around 4%. The gauge gained nearly 3% over the 11 sessions through Thursday, led by information technology and health-care stocks.
“There were some funds betting on a safety window and stability in the market leading up to the centennial,” said Hua Tong, a fund manager at Shenzhen Zhengyuan Investment Co. “Now that the event has passed, they are retreating without that perceived layer of safety.”
Authorities were targeting financial stability before Thursday’s ceremony and amid the tightening interbank funding environment at the end of the second quarter. The People’s Bank of China last week increased its short-term cash injection for the first time since March to soothe liquidity concerns. But it scaled back the additions as soon as the new quarter began, leading to net drainage of funds from the financial system.
“Investors went into the centenary yesterday with high expectations and market performance somewhat disappointed,” said Amy Lin, an analyst at Capital Securities. “Many turned sellers today. PBOC’s net withdrawal of liquidity didn’t help.”

8,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 10:13PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Mixed, Focus Now Squarely on U.S. Jobs Report for June","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Friday morning, finding their feet on the first trading day of July. Investors await U.S. employment data even as they continue digesting economic data from the U.S. and China.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.10% by 10 PM ET (2 AM GMT). According to data released earlier in the day, the country’s consumer price index rose a lower-than-expected 2.4% year-on-year in June.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.45% and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.27%. The Caixin purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for June, released on Thursday, was also a lower-than-expected 51.3.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%, with markets reopening after a holiday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.34% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.28%.
U.S. shares steadied after the S&P 500 posted its longest winning streak since February 2021. Economic data released on Thursday said that the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing PMI was a slightly lower-than-expected 60.6 in June and that a lower-than-forecast 364,000 initial jobless claims were filed throughout the past week.
Investors now await the country’s jobs report for June, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day. The data is expected to provide clues as to when the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin the asset tapering and interest rate hikes hinted at in June’s policy decision.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said cutting asset purchases by $10 billion a month might be reasonable and that he favored starting the process in 2021, according to a report. The International Monetary Fund also predicted that the central bank could begin asset tapering in the first half of 2022, and hike interest rates later in 2022 or in early 2023.
“With economic and earnings growth prospects robust, policy accommodative, and valuations still appealing relative to bonds, we believe the current environment is supportive of further equity gains,” UBS Global Wealth Management chief investment officer Mark Haefele said in a note.
Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will also speak later in the day.
Meanwhile, the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus remains a concern, with the U.S. warning that it could eclipse other variants in the nation within weeks. Hong Kong also said that a hotel cleaner has tested preliminarily positive for the variant, dashing hopes that the city has nipped its latest variant outbreak in the bud.
However, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine neutralizes the Delta variant and provides durable protection against infection more broadly, following  Moderna  Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRNA) claims that its vaccine also offered protection against the variant earlier in the week.
In cryptocurrencies, Robinhood Markets Inc. turned investors’ attention towards the sector as it filed for an initial public offering on Thursday, saying that 17% of its first-quarter transaction-based revenue came from digital coins."

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Asian merger and acquisition activity surged to its second-highest level ever for a first half as Southeast Asian and private-equity deals hit records, and bankers expect the strong momentum to be maintained for the rest of the year.
Announced deals involving Asian companies came to $707.7 billion in January-June, up 75% from the same period a year earlier and not far off the record of $758.6 billion logged in the first half of 2018, Refinitiv data showed.
Southeast Asia deals jumped 83% to a record $124.8 billion driven by blockbuster transactions including ride-hailing giant Grab's $40 billion merger with U.S. special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth Corp. 
Bankers expect Southeast Asia to remain a big focus for dealmaking.
""You still haven't seen capex demand come through because the Southeast Asian region is still kind of nascent in the recovery but you will start to see this re-emerging alongside refinancing and consolidation and M&A demand,"" said Amit Khattar, head of investment bank, Asia Pacific, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
He expects M&A in digital infrastructure such as data centres, telecommunication towers and the consumer sector, as well as real estate transactions, particularly in Singapore, as companies reassess office markets.
Other chunky deals in Southeast Asia included the $18 billion merger of Grab's Indonesian rival Gojek with local e-commerce firm Tokopedia, and a $15 billion merger of the units of Malaysian telecoms firm Axiata Group and Norway's Telenor.
""We're only half way through the year, but if market conditions remain constructive and based on our backlog, we look well placed to break all records,"" said David Biller, head of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Southeast Asia banking, capital markets and advisory business.
""The themes continue to be tech, consumer and healthcare. The spread of capital market and M&A deals is very much across all countries.""
Private equity-backed deals more than doubled to a record $102 billion.
Asia-focused PE funds raised $80.5 billion as of June 25, up 59% from a year ago and the most in two years, according to data provider Preqin. Dry powder in the region hit a new high of $384.9 billion in June.
PE deals were also fuelled by banks' improved lending appetite as many businesses across the region rebounded from last year's pandemic-induced slump.
Acquisition-related financing in the region climbed 16% to $57 billion as of June 25, Dealogic data showed.
PE firms swarmed into auctions of assets such as Hong Kong-based mattress maker King Koil and the China unit of drugmaker Mundipharma, which is owned by the billionaire American Sackler family. 
The sale of Reckitt Benckiser Group's China baby formula business was another example, with Primavera Capital Group emerging victorious over a bevy of rivals that included Sequoia Capital, KKR and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG).
""A key focus remains on sponsor buysides and exits and in particular on businesses that have been resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Rohit Satsangi, Deutsche's co-head of Asia M&A and head of Asia financial sponsors.
SPAC-related transactions slowed as regulators tightened oversight, but bankers are hopeful that many discussions about so-called de-spac deals, when SPACs merge with target firms, will lead to transactions over the coming months.

""A significant factor driving de-SPAC and M&A activity is investor optimism over the emergence of disruptive and fast-growing companies in the new mobility, renewable energy and technology sectors,"" said Rich Wong,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s head of M&A, Asia Pacific.
Morgan Stanley took the top spot in the region's M&A league table for announced deals, followed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

11,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 08:02PM ET</span>",Qualcomm's new CEO eyes dominance in the laptop markets,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's new chief thinks that by next year his company will have just the chip for laptop makers wondering how they can compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which last year introduced laptops using a custom-designed central processor chip that boasts longer battery life.
Longtime processor suppliers  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have no chips as energy efficient as Apple's. Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon told Reuters on Thursday he believes his company can have the best chip on the market, with help from a team of chip architects who formerly worked on the Apple chip but now work at Qualcomm. 
In his first interview since taking the top job at San Diego, California-based Qualcomm, Amon also said the company is also counting on revenue growth from China to power its core smartphone chip business despite political tensions. 
""We will go big in China,"" he said, noting that U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd give Qualcomm an opportunity to generate a lot more revenue.
Amon said a cornerstone of his strategy comes from a lesson learned in the smartphone chip market: It was not enough just to provide modem chips for phones' wireless data connectivity. Qualcomm also needed to provide the brains to turn the phone into a computer, which it now does for most premium Android devices.
Now, as Qualcomm looks to push 5G connectivity into laptops, it is pairing modems with a powerful central processor unit, or CPU, Amon said. Instead of using computing core blueprints from longtime partner Arm Ltd, as it now does for smartphones, Qualcomm concluded it needed custom-designed chips if its customers were to rival new laptops from Apple.
As head of Qualcomm's chip division, Amon this year led the $1.4 billion acquisition of startup Nuvia, whose ex-Apple founders help design some those Apple laptop chips before leaving to form the startup. Qualcom will start selling Nuvia-based laptop chips next year.
""We needed to have the leading performance for a battery-powered device,"" Amon said. ""If Arm, which we've had a relationship with for years, eventually develops a CPU that's better than what we can build ourselves, then we always have the option to license from Arm.""
Arm is in the midst of being purchased by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp for $40 billion, a merger that Qualcomm has objected to with regulators.
Amon said Qualcomm has no plans to build its own products to enter the other big market for CPUs - data centers for cloud computing companies. But it will license Nuvia's designs to cloud computing companies that want to build their own chips, which could put it in competition with parts of Arm.
""We are more than willing to leverage the Nuvia CPU assets to partner with companies that are interested as they build their data center solutions,"" Amon said.
BRANDING CHALLENGE
Phone chips accounted for $12.8 billion of its $16.5 billion in chip revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Some of Qualcomm's best customers, such as phone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp, are in China.
Qualcomm is counting on revenue growth as its Android handset customers swoop in on former users of phones from Huawei, which was forced out of the handset market by Washington's sanctions. 
Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research, called it a ""political minefield"" due to rising U.S.-China tensions. But Amon said the company could do business as usual there.
""We license our technology - we don't have to do forced joint ventures with technology transfers. Our customers in China are current with their agreements, so you see respect for American intellectual property,"" he said.
Another major challenge for Amon will be hanging on to Apple as a customer. Qualcomm's modem chips are now in all Apple iPhone 12 models after a bruising legal battle. Apple sued Qualcomm in 2017 but eventually dropped its claims and signed chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm in 2019.
Apple is now designing chips to displace Qualcomm's communications chips in iPhones. 
""The biggest overhang for Qualcomm's long-term stock multiple is the worry that right now, it's as good as it gets, because they're shipping into all the iPhones, but someday, Apple will do those chips internally,"" said Michael Walkley, a senior analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group.
Amon said that Qualcomm has decades of experience designing modem chips that will be hard for any rival to replicate and that the void in the Android market left by Huawei creates new revenue opportunities for Qualcomm. 
""Just for the premium tier alone, the Huawei addressable market is as big as the Apple opportunity is for us,"" Amon said.
Another challenge for Amon, a gregarious executive who is energetic onstage during keynote presentations, will be that Qualcom is not well known to consumers in the way that Intel or Nvidia are, even in Qualcomm's hometown. 
""I flew into San Diego and got an Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver at the airport and told him I was going to Qualcomm. He said, 'You mean the stadium?'"" Krewell said, referring to the football arena formerly home to the San Diego Chargers.
Amon has started a new branding program for the company's Snapdragon smartphone chips to try to change that. 

""We have a mature smartphone industry today. People care what's behind the glass,"" he said.

Funk, 82, will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday.
""I didn't think I'd ever get to go up,"" Funk said in a video interview posted on the company's website.
Funk, then a 21-year-old pilot, was the youngest of the 13 women who passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's program that first sent Americans into space between 1961 and 1963, but were denied the chance to become astronauts themselves because of their gender.
She was the first female flight instructor at a U.S. military base and the first woman to become an air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. 

She is due to join Bezos's brother, Mark, and the winner of an auction aboard the New Shepard rocket as it ascends more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space. The passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness and be able to marvel at the planet's curvature through viewing windows before the pressurized passenger capsule returns to earth under parachutes.
Bezos, the richest man on the planet, is stepping down as the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on July 5. He has been vying with fellow billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson to become the first to travel into space on a privately developed rocket.

The department and NAR had reached an agreement, announced in November, that required the organization either to scrap or change rules in order to give prospective home buyers more information about commissions for the brokers who represented them and to eliminate any misrepresentation that the services were free. 
It also was to change rules that allow access to lock boxes only to brokers affiliated with the NAR.
The settlement would have restricted the Justice Department in pursuing additional probes of the association.
""The department is taking this action to permit a broader investigation of NAR's rules and conduct to proceed without restriction,"" the government said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 reached its sixth consecutive all-time closing high on Thursday, as a new quarter and the second half of the year began with upbeat economic data and a broad-based rally.
Investors now eye Friday's much-anticipated employment report.
The bellwether index is enjoying its longest winning streak since early February, and the last time it logged six straight all-time highs was last August.
""Historical data shows if you have a strong first half, the second half of the year was actually going even stronger,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst with Baird Private Wealth.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session in positive territory, but a decline in tech shares - led by microchips - tempered the Nasdaq's gain. 
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index slid 1.5%
""For markets so far this year, boring is beautiful,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""Economic growth has been strong enough to support prices and many asset classes are trading with historically low volatility."" 
""It feels like investors left for the Fourth of July weekend about three months ago.""
The ongoing worker shortage, attributed to federal emergency unemployment benefits, a childcare shortage and lingering pandemic fears, was a common theme in the day's economic data.
Jobless claims continued their downward trajectory according to the Labor Department, touching their lowest level since the pandemic shutdown, and a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned layoffs by U.S. firms were down 88% from last year, hitting a 21-year low.
Activity at U.S. factories expanded at a slightly decelerated pace in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers' index (PMI), with the employment component dipping into contraction for the first time since November. The prices paid index, driven higher by the current demand/supply imbalance, soared to its highest level since 1979, according to ISM.
""The employment and manufacturing data released today supported the idea of continued growth but at a decelerated rate,"" Carter added.
Friday's hotly anticipated jobs report is expected to show payrolls growing by 700,000 and unemployment inching down to 5.7%. A robust upside surprise could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to adjust its timetable for tapering its securities purchases and raising key interest rates.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 06:55PM ET</span>","U.S. quarterly auto sales jump on strong SUV demand, shift to EVs","(Reuters) -U.S. automakers on Thursday reported a sharp rise in quarterly sales on strong demand for SUVs and pointed to the trend continuing into 2022, as more people shift to private conveyance and new electric vehicles (EVs) line up for launch.
Low interest rates, government stimulus and a preference for personal transportation due to the COVID-19 pandemic have bolstered demand for cars, even as prices have risen due to tight inventories following a global semiconductor shortage.
Higher vehicle prices have boosted profitability for automakers, who have also increased investments in EV production.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said its Chevrolet Bolt EV posted record second-quarter deliveries, with total Chevrolet sales up 31%, while sales of its Buick premium SUVs soared 86%. 
""We expect continued high demand in the second half of this year and into 2022,"" Elaine Buckberg, GM's chief economist, said.
Last month, the No.1 U.S. automaker increased its EV budget to $35 billion through 2025.
Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said alternative powered vehicles represented nearly a quarter of its sales volume through June this year, up from 13% a year earlier. 
Toyota's overall U.S. sales rose about 73% to 688,813 vehicles in the second quarter.
""There need to be more models beyond Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ... next year, the (Ford) F-150 Lightning should help move the needle upward,"" said Morningstar analyst David Whiston.
Several new EVs will launch in the second half of 2021 including Chevrolet's Bolt EUV, Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Kia's EV6 models, helping lift the overall share of EVs in the United States from just 2% of all registered vehicles currently.

Ford, which sold more than 10,000 units of its Mustang Mach-E SUV in the first five months of this year, will launch the electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup in 2022. The company is expected to report its sales numbers on Friday.
Separately, data from analytics firm Wards Intelligence showed that the pace of U.S. light-vehicle sales slowed in June to 1.3 million units from 1.6 million in May.

MADRID (Reuters) -Caixabank has agreed with unions to lay off 6,452 employees in what will be the biggest ever staff overhaul in Spanish banking, even after the lender shaved 1,800 cuts from its initial plans, the bank and a union spokesperson said on Thursday.
The agreement to reduce its workforce in Spain by around 14.5% was reached after the bank met some of the union's demands, such as voluntary redundancies rather than compulsory cuts, Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) union and the bank said.
The deal was also made possible after improving financial compensation for those who leave the bank, a spokesperson for the union added.
In April, Caixabank had announced plans to cut 8,291 jobs, one of the largest such culls in Spain's corporate history, and close 1,534 branches, slightly more than a quarter of its offices, to adapt to a customer shift towards online banking.
Caixabank in March closed the acquisition of Bankia to become the country's biggest domestic lender in terms of total assets. It estimated that layoffs would cost 1.9 billion euros ($2.25 billion).
It also said the extraordinary gross charge would have a negative impact of 90 basis points in its reported core tier-1 capital as of end of March and that costs and capital impact would be fully booked in the second quarter of 2021.
The bank also said it would reduce the number of branches affected to around 1,500.
The bank has around 5,550 branches and 44,400 staff in Spain.
The agreement with the union is a key aspect of the Bankia deal, which is underpinned by annual cost savings of 770 million euros ($916 million) by 2023. Caixabank said the agreement would save at least this amount..

It said it would provide further details at the upcoming second quarter results presentation.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reached its sixth consecutive all-time closing high on upbeat economic data, and European shares ended higher on a rally in crude prices.
Investors now eye Friday's much-anticipated employment report.

Oil prices rose about 2% on indications that OPEC+ producers could increase output more slowly than expected in coming months, while rising global fuel demand would continue to tighten supply. 
The dollar index hit three-month highs and U.S. Treasury yields crept a little higher ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report, which could offer clues on when the Federal Reserve will start to pare back stimulus.
The benchmark 10-year yield was last up 3.1 basis points at 1.4747%. On Wednesday, it tumbled to its lowest level since June 21 at 1.438%, due mostly to quarter- and month-end demand.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 05:31PM ET</span>",U.S. adds Turkey to list of countries implicated in use of child soldiers,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Thursday added Turkey to a list of countries that are implicated in the use of child soldiers over the past year, placing a NATO ally for the first time in such a list, in a move that is likely to further complicate the already fraught ties between Ankara and Washington.
The U.S. State Department determined in its 2021 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) that Turkey was providing ""tangible support"" to the Sultan Murad division in Syria, a faction of Syrian opposition that Ankara has long, supported and a group that Washington said recruited and used child soldiers.
There was no immediate reaction from Turkey on the move. 
In a briefing call with reporters, a senior State Department official also made a reference to the use of child soldiers in Libya, saying Washington was hoping to work with Ankara on the issue to address it.
""With respect to Turkey in particular...this is the first time a NATO member has been listed in the child soldier prevention act list,"" the State Department official said. ""As a respected regional leader and member of NATO, Turkey has the opportunity to address this issue -- the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Syria and Libya,"" she said.
Turkey has carried out three cross-border operations in Syria against the so-called Islamic State, as well as U.S.-backed Kurdish militia and has frequently used factions of armed Syrian fighters on top of its own forces.
Some of these groups have been accused by human rights groups and the United Nations of indiscriminately attacking civilians and carrying out kidnappings and lootings. The United Nations had asked Ankara to rein in these Syrian rebels while Turkey rejected the allegations, calling them 'baseless'.
Turkey, through proxies and its own armed forces, has also been involved in the Libyan conflict. Ankara's support has helped the Tripoli-based government reverse a 14-month assault from eastern forces backed by Egypt and Russia.
Governments placed on this list are subject to restrictions, according to the State Department report, on certain security assistance and commercial licensing of military equipment, absent a presidential waiver.
It was not immediately clear whether any restrictions would automatically apply to Turkey and the move raised questions whether it could derail Ankara's ongoing negotiations with Washington on Turkey's bid to run Afghanistan's Kabul airport once U.S. completes its pullout of its troops.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said the two things won't likely be linked. ""When it comes to trafficking in persons, I would not want to link the report today with the constructive discussions we're engaging in with Turkey, in the context of Afghanistan or any other area of shared interest,"" he said in a briefing.
Turkey has offered to guard and run Hamid Karzai airport after NATO's withdrawal and has been holding talks with the United States on logistic and financial support for the mission.
The mission could be a potential area of cooperation between Ankara and its allies amid strained ties, as the security of the airport is crucial for the operation of diplomatic missions out of Afghanistan after the withdrawal. 
To carry out this task, Ankara has sought various financial and operational support, and President Joe Biden, in a meeting last month with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had said that U.S. support would be forthcoming, Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan had said.

Price described Turkey as a ""very constructive and very helpful partner"" when it comes to Afghanistan and added that Washington could have more to say on the implications.
""As you know there is a potential for waivers that would come down from the president but that will happen, if it does, in the coming months,"" he said.

The stock opened at $16.30, lower than its $17 initial public offering price. 
Krispy Kreme had priced its offering of 29.4 million shares well below the planned range of $21 to $24 per share to raise $500 million, indicating weak response from investors during one of the busiest weeks for market debuts in the United States.
Krispy Kreme's late founder Vernon Rudolph made the chain's first doughnut in 1937 with ingredients he borrowed from a local grocer after spending his last $25 renting a building in what is now called Old Salem. 
The first doughnuts were delivered to be sold to a local grocery after Rudolph took the back seat out of his 1936 Pontiac and installed a delivery rack.
He later had to cut a hole in the wall to set up a retail outlet to sell directly to customers seeking hot doughnuts.
Krispy Kreme now has roughly 1,400 retail shops in 33 countries and also sells at about 12,000 grocery, convenience and mass merchant stores in the United States.
Krispy Kreme recorded record net revenue of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020. The doughnut chain said nearly two-thirds of its doughnut sales in fiscal 2020 came from its ""Original Glazed"" doughnut. It also sells coffee, drinks and sweet treats.

The company was taken private by JAB Holding Co in a $1.35 billion deal in 2016, when the investment firm was ramping up its bets on coffee and restaurant businesses.
J.P.Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were the lead book-running managers.

However, these stocks are likely to grow into these valuations given that their software has become integral to many corporations.It’s been an impressive stretch for the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), with the index up more than 6% for the month of June, pushing the index to a 12% return year-to-date, after already lapping an incredible 47% return last year. While the index is not yet overbought, as shown below, we continue to have high levels of complacency, and the Nasdaq Composite is now nearing overbought levels. This doesn’t mean that the market can’t go higher from here, but it does suggest elevated risk for starting new positions, with the best course of action being to wait for a dip to add exposure to the market. For investors patient to wait for a dip, two names look to be solid buy-the-dip candidates if we do see some weakness this summer. Both names sport double-digit compound annual EPS growth rates and are leaders in their industry with high double-digit sales growth, making them ideal candidates to put at the top of one’s shopping list.
(Source: TC2000.com)
DocuSign (DOCU) and Atlassian (TEAM) have underperformed the Nasdaq Composite over the past six months, with the Software Sector lagging the Nasdaq Composite after an impressive rally off the March 2020 lows. While this underperformance has been a little disappointing, it’s to be expected, as even the best growth stocks need time to build new bases after a triple-digit performance in less than a year. The good news is that these multi-month consolidations have allowed DOCU and TEAM to grow into their valuations a little, with TEAM now trading at 131x FY2023 annual EPS estimates and DOCU trading at 102x FY2024 annual EPS estimates. These are not cheap valuations by any means, which trades at a deep discount to peers currently. However, for high growth stories with 75% plus margins like this, I would expect further weakness to improve valuations should present a buying opportunity, given how strong these names acted during the recent correction.

OPEC+ producers are reported to be upbeat regarding current and future market conditions, and the cartel is expected to raise total oil production by 500,000 barrels per day in August.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stretched its run of record daily closes to six on Thursday, boosted by energy on rising oil prices as major oil producers delayed their meeting by a day, while positive labor data buoyed expectations for a strong monthly jobs report due Friday. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.52% to close at a record of 4,319.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.38%, or 138 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.13%. 
OPEC+ delayed its meeting by one day to Friday after a key member, the United Arab Emirates, was unwilling to go along with the reported preliminary deal - a 0.5 million barrel per day hike - agreed to by Saudi Arabia and Russia on Thursday. The delay casts doubt on whether the major oil producers will be able to reach a consensus on a production hike.     
Oil prices remained hit their highest level since October 2018 as investors bet that potentially higher output will be absorbed comfortably by an undersupplied market amid robust demand.  
""In our opinion, such an increase [of 500,000 barrels per day in August] would hardly be able to prevent a further rise in oil prices given that OPEC estimates that the market will be 1.9 million barrels per day short in the second half of the year…,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note ahead of the decision.
The backdrop for cyclical stocks – those that move in tandem with economy – including energy was also supported by strength in the labor market ahead of the Friday's monthly jobs numbers.
""We forecast nonfarm payrolls rose 620,000 in June following a 559,000 rise in May as we think employers ramped up recruitment efforts and increased compensation to draw people back into employment,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Wages will likely be heavily scrutinized as companies are expected to have to pay up in order to attract employees, particularly in the services sector, at a time when the unemployment benefits has played a role in adding to labor supply shortage.   
""In this jobs report coming up Friday, there'll be a big focus on the wage component of the data, not just the [headline] number,"" John Ragard, senior portfolio manager, small cap equity at Spouting Rock Asset Management told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday.  ""In previous reports, there really wasn't a significant lift off in wage increases [...] the May report showed about 2% increase in hourly wage growth.""
""[W]e're going to start seeing bigger increases in the hourly wage rate as we move through the summer and into the fall, just because that's what's needed to pull people back into the service sector,"" Ragard added.
Tech, meanwhile, was hurt by a weaker semiconductor stocks, paced by a decline in Micron (NASDAQ:MU).
Micron fell nearly 6% as the some on Wall Street sound the alarm on the peak pricing, pointing to an easing supply shortage in the second half of the year.
Summit downgraded Micron to hold from buy, and said the peak will be brought on by the seasonal build in the chipmaker's memory supply and customers switching inventory management to just-in-time from just-in-case inventory management.

29,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 03:53PM ET</span>","Krispy Kreme, June Jobs, Unemployment Rate: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Energy shined Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 to a new intraday high after the OPEC+ oil cartel postponed its meeting for a day after struggling to reach consensus on supply.   
OPEC+, which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus allies led by Russia, delayed its meeting to Friday after the United Arab Emirates couldn’t go along with the reported preliminary deal for a 500,000 barrel per day hike struck Thursday by Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Oil prices remained near their highest level since October 2018 as the prospect of higher output should be balanced by an undersupplied market amid robust demand.  
Positive news about the labor market also held up cyclical stocks – those that move in tandem with the economy, ahead of the government’s report on jobs for June. Otherwise, Friday’s U.S. session is bound to be quiet as people prepare to head out for the three day holiday weekend.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow. 
1. Donut watch
 Krispy Kreme  Inc (NASDAQ:DNUT), the donut chain, began trading in New York on Thursday and moved 19% higher after an initial hiccup on the Nasdaq. The stock opened lower at $16.30 and then quickly rebounded. The company had priced its share at $17 apiece.
2. The jobs report
U.S. nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 700,000 in June, higher than the growth of 559,000 in the prior month. This is the first release of the data since the last time the Federal Reserve's policy making committee met.
3. Unemployment rate
The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to continue its slide in June, falling to 5.7% from 5.8% in May. It was 6.1% in April.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 03:53PM ET</span>","U.S. companies spend billions on stay-at-home tech, boding ill for office properties","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. economy reopens, ramped-up corporate spending on video systems and plans to increase shared workspace suggests hybrid work is here to stay, potentially weighing on commercial property prices in New York, San Francisco and other major cities.
After jumping in the wake of the pandemic, sales of tech for facilitating remote work continues to trend higher. Retail sales of USB cameras and computer microphones rose 77% and 36% each from March to May from the same period last year, after doubling from those months in 2019, according to market research firm NPD Group.
Computer goods maker Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) International SA said earlier this year it expected sales of webcams and cloud-based video collaboration equipment to remain strong in 2021, after tripling to $1.48 billion in the 12 months ended in March from a year earlier.
And a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) survey showed that a majority of companies plan to increase shared workspace, as they try to reduce costly real estate.
""Executives at many corporations would like everyone back, but technology spending plans tell you they recognize the need for a flexible workspace,"" said Vikram Malhotra, a real estate analyst at Morgan Stanley.
The rise of the hybrid office poses a headwind to workspace demand in cities like New York and San Francisco, where there have been few big-name office building sales in recent months. Institutional holdings of office assets in the two cities are valued at $231 billion and $128 billion, respectively, according to LaSalle Investment Management.
While leasing activity has rebounded since the lows of the pandemic, rental prices are weak and vacancy rates remain high, weighing on the value of office buildings and stymying deal activity. 
Total sales of office properties in Manhattan, for example, slid by more than half to $5.4 billion last year and were just $41.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, according to Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK) Plc. 
The work-from-home trend will weaken the pricing power landlords have on leases and the returns investors expect from office assets, Malhotra said. The bank estimates the changes will reduce the amount of U.S. office space by about 13%.
Green Street, a real estate advisory firm, forecast in June that remote work may negatively impact office demand by about 15%.
""Prices in those big global gateway cities - New York, San Francisco - they're the poster child, they're soft,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. ACCELERATED CHANGES
Many corporations plan to allow at least some remote work, including Swiss bank UBS Group, which earlier this week announced plans for a mostly hybrid workforce. Other companies, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley, have resisted establishing a hybrid workplace.
At Cerner Corp (NASDAQ:CERN), a U.S. healthcare technology company, 75% of its 27,000 employees could be ""dynamic"" and work half the time remotely, said Tracy Platt, Cerner's chief human resources officer. 
""We want to get the best of both worlds and we're confident we can through this model,"" she said.
Not everyone believes hybrid work will shrink offices or maintain its appeal in the long run. Most employees will likely work three- to four-day weeks, making space consolidation tougher, said Alex Goldfarb, an analyst at Piper Sandler. 
At the same time, ""people want to be seen as though they're part of the game, and there's not a game out there that you can win if you're not on the field,"" he said.
Still, the pandemic has accelerated changes that had been afoot for some time. Vocon, an architecture firm, designed offices before the pandemic that had 20% of employees at so-called hot desks, where multiple workers use a single physical work station at different times. Now, said Vocon, some clients are allocating more than 40% for what can be shared space.
""Does it make sense to require people to come to a certain specific location every day? In some cases it didn't make sense before the pandemic,"" said Deb Donley, owner and principal at Vocon.
Demand for office space does not need to collapse to adversely impact occupancy, rents and values, LaSalle analysts wrote. A demand drop of 5 to 10% could spur elevated vacancy rates and delay the sector's recovery five or 10 years, the unit of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc said.
LaSalle has underweighted its exposure to office buildings since well before the pandemic, said Rich Kleinman, LaSalle's co-chief investment officer for the Americas.

""Many people have not been accurately assessing the amount of capital that's needed over the long term to own an office building,"" Kleinman said. ""It's not as attractive of a risk-return proposition as some other property types.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 trended close to its intraday high Thursday, led by energy as oil prices remained well supported as OPEC+ postponed its meeting to Friday after struggling to reach consensus on supply.   
The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to remain close to its intraday record of 4,320.60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.29%, or 100 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.04%. 
OPEC+ delayed its meeting by one day to Friday after a key member, the United Arab Emirates, was unwilling to go along with the reported preliminary deal - for a 0.5 million barrel per day hike - that Saudi Arabia and Russia struck on Thursday.
Oil prices remained near their highest level since October 2018 as  the potentially higher output is expected to absorbed comfortably by an undersupplied market amid robust demand.  
""In our opinion, such an increase [of 500,000 barrels per day in August] would hardly be able to prevent a further rise in oil prices given that OPEC estimates that the market will be 1.9 million barrels per day short in the second half of the year…,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note ahead of the decision.
The backdrop for cyclical stocks – those that move in tandem with economy – including energy were also supported by pointing to strength in the labor market ahead of the Friday's monthly jobs numbers.
""We forecast nonfarm payrolls rose 620,000 in June following a 559,000 rise in May as we think employers ramped up recruitment efforts and increased compensation to draw people back into employment,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Tech, meanwhile, was hurt by a weaker semiconductor stocks, paced by a decline in Micron (NASDAQ:MU).
Micron fell nearly 6% as the some on Wall Street sound the alarm on the peak pricing, pointing to an easing supply shortage in the second half of the year.
Summit downgraded Micron to hold from buy, and said the peak will be brought on by the seasonal build in the chipmaker's memory supply and customers switching inventory management to just-in-time from just-in-case inventory management.
Megacap tech, meanwhile, offered little to the broader market advanced as the fab 5 remained mostly lower.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) of America said it sold more than 211,000 cars in the first half of 2021, its highest level for the period in nearly 50 years, and is on pace to sell more than 400,000 this year, Chief Executive and President Scott Keogh said in a media briefing on Thursday.
The U.S. arm of Germany's Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) has been able to boost sales volume and market share thanks to an expanded portfolio that is increasingly focused on SUVs, from the new Taos compact to the all-electric ID.4, Keogh said.
The German-built ID.4 hit U.S. dealers earlier this year and sold 5,756 units in the first half, with 85% of trade-ins coming from owners of non-electric vehicles.
""It's the most profitable car for our dealers,"" Keogh said.
The ID.4 goes into production at VW's Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant in the second half of 2022 and eventually will be joined in the United States by a variety of companion models, including an all-electric people mover inspired by the classic VW Microbus.
Keogh said nearly three-quarters of VW's U.S. sales were SUVs, which boosted average prices by around $4,000 from a year ago.

Sales slowed a fraction in June, he said, as inventories of unsold models dwindled to 32,000, about a 30-day supply for dealers.
Given the global chip shortage, Keogh said the vehicle pipeline could remain tight in July and August, but should open up in the fall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission lowered the bar on when it decides to file antitrust lawsuits on Thursday by scrapping a 2015 statement that said it would be guided by the ""promotion of consumer welfare"" when looking at new investigations.
In an open meeting conducted online, the commission voted 3-2 to withdraw the statement, with Democrats voting for the withdrawal and Republican commissioners against.
""Withdrawing the 2015 statement is only the start of our efforts to clarify the meaning of Section 5 and apply it to today's market,"" Chair Lina Khan, a progressive, said at the meeting. Section 5 of the FTC Act says unfair methods of competition, which it does not describe in detail, are unlawful.
The commission also voted along party lines to approve a rule tightening who can claim that goods are ""Made in USA"" and to approve a measure that would streamline FTC rule-making. 
The commission voted 3-2 to streamline investigations by FTC staff, with Khan mentioning in particular probes related to the Big Tech platforms, health care markets, the COVID-19 public health emergency, among others.
Khan, who took the position in June, took the unusual step of scheduling the votes to be held in public. 
The meeting occurs at a time of major change at the FTC, which has prided itself on reaching agreements by consensus.
In this meeting, the two Republican commissioners, Christine Wilson and Noah Phillips, said that the steps that the agency took on Thursday fell short of true transparency because they learned of the meeting just days ago.

They also repeatedly warned the steps could put the FTC at risk of Congress stepping in, as it did four decades ago, to rein in an agency that they thought were overreaching.
Public Knowledge, which has been critical of Big Tech, said that rescinding the 2015 policy statement was positive. Competition Policy Director Charlotte Slaiman said it was ""one of the first signs that the FTC is ready for bold and decisive action with Chair Khan at the helm.""

The composite hit its $14,535.97, 52-week high on June 29. Among other sectors, several computer hardware stocks have been gaining because the demand for computer hardware is increasing as companies rearrange their operations to continue working with a remote workforce, even if only partly.
In the digital era, the use of internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud-based products and services is expected to keep increasing, which will foster a growing need for computer hardware. According to The Business Research Company, the global computer hardware market is expected to grow at a 9.4% CAGR to hit $944.09 billion in 2021.

Didi absorbed Uber's China business in 2016 - Uber retains a 12.8% stake in the firm - and averaged 25 million rides a day in the first three months of the year in China, where it is the dominant operator.
Here are some key facts of the company and its global rival, U.S.-based industry pioneer Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which has a market capitalisation of $95 billion:
FOUNDING
- Didi was founded by Chief Executive Will Cheng, formerly at  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), in Beijing in 2012. Co-founder and President Jean Liu joined in 2014. 
- Uber was founded in 2009 by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick. It went public in May 2019. 
BUSINESS PROFILE
- Didi's main business is ride-hailing in China. It operates in 15 international markets including South America, Japan, Australia, Russia and South Africa. It also provides services including food delivery, community group buying and logistics.
- Uber's core business includes ride-hailing, which operates in about 70 countries, and restaurant food delivery under its Uber Eats brand in 34 countries.
The company generates the bulk of its revenue in the United States and Canada.
DRIVERS
- Didi has 15 million annual active drivers globally for the twelve months ended March, 2021. 
- Uber in February 2020 said it had some 5 million drivers worldwide. 
PROFITABILITY
- Didi was loss-making from 2018 through 2020 but made a $30 million profit in the first quarter this year. 
- Uber keeps losing money but has promised investors to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of this year.
CARS
- Many Didi drivers rent cars from fleet companies. Didi has fleet management partnerships with carmakers including Toyota, BYD and Nissan (OTC:NSANY). 
- Uber drivers in most of the company's markets are independent contractors who use their own vehicles. Uber disbanded its own vehicle rental program in 2018, but drivers can still sign up for short-term rentals with other companies. 
TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT
- Didi is testing autonomous driving with a fleet of more than 100 cars. 
- Uber in December sold its autonomous driving unit, Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), to self-driving car startup Aurora.

- Didi rolled out a purpose-built vehicle for ride-hailing with China's BYD and is working on a future model with autonomous driving functions with GAC, a Chinese carmaker.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 01:57PM ET</span>","After $4.4 billion New York IPO, founders of China's Didi eye global growth","By Julie Zhu and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - From working at a foot massage company to setting up China's biggest ride-hailing firm, Will Wei Cheng has navigated several hurdles on the path to taking Didi Global Inc public in a $4.4-billion New York float.
As Cheng rose to the upper echelons of Chinese technology entrepreneurs, he faced challenges including tough competition, intense criticism for Didi after rape and murder cases linked to its drivers in 2018, and a COVID-19 induced slowdown at home.
While the biggest share sale by a Chinese company in the United States in seven years, which values Didi at $67.5 billion, is a big win for Cheng and co-founder Jean Qing Liu, experts say the challenges are unlikely to go away soon.
The duo will now be tested on their ability to stem losses that widened last year due to the pandemic and tackle regulatory scrutiny amid an antitrust crackdown at home as they set about expanding Didi globally.
Cheng has a strategic eye, is quietly confident and hard working, Didi employees and investors said. Some added Cheng is a micro-manager and his management style could be cut-throat.
""When there is a Will, there is a way,"" said Neil Shen, founder and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China, a Didi investor. 
""Together with Didi and its hundreds of millions of users, we look forward to creating a better world of future mobility.""
Cheng, 38, who favours polo shirts and Chinese history and military books, was initially eyeing a valuation of up to $100 billion for Didi, Reuters has reported.
That target was a result of Cheng focusing on his standing in his generation of entrepreneurs, said a senior Didi source. He is not giving up his aggressive stance yet, the source added.
""He is very keen to build Didi into a global company with a market value of $200 billion,"" said the source, who did not want to be named as he was not allowed to talk to media.
Didi founders trimmed their valuation target for the IPO as investors baulked at the $100 billion target amid concerns that greater regulation of the ride-sharing sector in the future could curb the company's growth prospects.
There was also uncertainty over how an antitrust probe into Didi, revealed by Reuters, would impact the company.
Didi and its founders did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Launched in Beijing in 2012, Didi aspires to become a global technology company, Cheng and Liu wrote in the IPO prospectus, saying the business model was relevant in markets including Latin America, Russia and South Africa.
It already dominates the ride-hailing industry at home since successfully pushing Uber (NYSE:UBER) out after the U.S. company lost a price war and ended up selling its China operations to Didi for a stake in 2016. 
Didi competes with ride-hailing services by automakers such as Geely and SAIC Motor in China. 
In Europe and South America, where it is expanding, Uber has a presence.
Didi, backed by SoftBank Group Corp, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, is due to debut on Wednesday morning New York time.
CHENG AND LIU
Cheng was born in 1983 in a small town in the southeastern Chinese province of Jiangxi.
After graduating from Beijing University of Chemical Technology with a bachelor's degree in administration, he worked as an assistant to the chairman of a foot massage company.
He joined Alibaba as a sales person in 2005 and later became a senior manager at the firm before starting Didi. 
Cheng, currently CEO of Didi, says he got the idea for a ride-hailing platform on a freezing winter night in Beijing when he had trouble getting a taxi.
In 2014, Cheng was joined by Liu, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and the current president of Didi.
Liu, a Harvard alumna, has been deeply involved in Didi's key financial decisions including its merger with Alibaba-backed Kuaidi in 2015, takeover of Uber's China business and fundraising from investors including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Liu, 43, represents the company in external communications, especially during crises. 

She was the face of Didi after two murder and rape cases related to its Hitch carpooling service drivers in 2018, which the founders described as their ""darkest days"". 
She also works on Didi's redesign of safety process.

Consider These 2 Crypto Stocks Wall Street Loves,"Bitcoin prices could surge in the coming months following an extended slump over the past couple of months. And because North America is expected now to become the global bitcoin mining hub in the wake of China’s crackdown, many analysts expect Bitcoin to hit $100k by year’s end. Consequently, Wall Street analysts expect popular crypto stocks Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) to be among the biggest gainers from the potential crypto rally. Read on for details.Bitcoin is poised to make an extraordinary comeback from its retreat over the past couple of months. Owing to China’s intensified crackdown on cryptocurrencies, bitcoin mining is expected to shift to North America given favorable regulatory measures in that region. Furthermore, despite the U.K.’s regulatory ban on Binance cryptocurrency exchange, Bitcoin prices have risen 3.1% since.
A recent Bloomberg report suggests that Bitcoin prices might hit the $100,000 mark this year given the renewed interest in cryptocurrencies, newly launched crypto ETFs in Canada and Europe, and increasing institutional investment in the asset.
In light of these developments, Wall Street analysts expect crypto stocks Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) to deliver solid gains in the coming months.

LONDON (Reuters) -The chair of JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion's remuneration committee will leave the board following a shareholder rebellion over management pay at Britain's biggest sportswear retailer.
At the retailer's annual investor meeting (AGM) on Thursday 54.65% of independent votes cast opposed non-executive director Andrew Leslie's reappointment to the board, while 45.35% were in favour.
Leslie had been on JD Sports' board for 11 years, longer than Britain's corporate governance code recommends.
The group said he would step down immediately.
JD Sports has been criticised by shareholder advisory groups for paying longstanding boss Peter Cowgill a bonus in a year the group received taxpayer money for business rates relief and staff furloughed during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Investors have become more vocal in their opposition to boardroom pay deals they deem excessive amid society's broader struggles in the pandemic. 
At the JD Sports AGM, 31.5% of votes cast opposed the group's pay report and 20% opposed its pay policy.
Ahead of the meeting the firm had bowed to critics of its corporate governance by saying it would split Cowgill's role as executive chairman and recruit a chief executive over the next year. 
It said ""a comprehensive process"" to divide the role would commence shortly. 
""We fully accept that the composition of our board should reflect the current scale, momentum and global positioning of the group as well as its increased level of market capitalisation,"" it said. 
Corporate governance guidelines recommend that the roles of chairman and CEO should be kept separate. 
JD Sports, whose stock market value has grown to 9.5 billion pounds ($13.1 billion) as it has expanded across Europe and the United States, also acknowledged a need to create ""additional diversity"" within its board.
The group said it would consider repaying government support on payroll costs but defer a final decision until there was certainty on both the full easing of pandemic restrictions and the consequences of any further lockdowns during the peak trading period this winter.
The group said it had seen positive trading in the period since stores reopened after lockdowns, particularly in the United States.
It forecast profit before tax and exceptional items for the full 2021-22 year of ""no less"" than 550 million pounds, up from previous guidance of 475-500 million and 421.3 million pounds made in 2020-21.

""As in previous years, we continue to express concern at the company's approach and transparency in addressing the diesel issue and effecting cultural change,"" Glass Lewis said in a statement.
Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. diesel engine tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.
The German group's annual general meeting is scheduled for July 22 and shareholders are being asked, as usual, to ratify the actions of both management and supervisory boards.
Glass Lewis said it welcomed the fact that an investigation by law firm Gleiss Lutz did not produce evidence that current management board members had committed breaches of duty with regard to the diesel scandal. 
But it added: ""We continue to have substantial concerns with the company's exposure to legal and regulatory risks, and the company's disclosure thereof.""
""We do not believe that shareholders can confidently conclude from the disclosure provided that the management board has taken the necessary steps to regain stakeholder confidence, sufficiently strengthen the company's compliance management, and effect necessary cultural change,"" it added. 

Volkswagen had no immediate comment.

Investing.com – Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) stock was having a roller coaster ride on Thursday, a day after emerging from bankruptcy.
The stock bounced between massive gains and losses in the first half-hour of trading. It opened at $22 and almost immediately surged more than 50% to $35 before reversing direction and tumbling to as low as $16, according to Bloomberg.
It is now trading over-the-counter under a new ticker HTZZ.
Many investors are anxious to see when the shares will be listed on a formal stock exchange, which would mean improved access to capital, more liquidity and increased accountability. Its trading on the New York Stock Exchange was suspended in October.
The revival of the rental car company comes at a time when Americans are looking to step out and travel to meet people and go for holidays.  
Funds and accounts affiliated with Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management provided $6 billion in equity to fund Hertz's revised plan of reorganization and exit Chapter 11 proceedings.

(Reuters) - European shares ended higher on Thursday as a rally in crude prices saw energy stocks surge more than 2%, while strong earnings reports helped dispel some concerns over the infectious ""Delta"" variant of the coronavirus. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.6% higher at 455.63 points, with energy stocks marking their best day in one month. Energy services provider TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) Plc was the top gainer in the sector, adding 4.4%. 
Oil prices rose almost $2 on the prospect of increasing global demand, while lower U.S. crude stocks helped. Reuters also reported that OPEC would hike production by less than expected, which could result in a supply shortfall and support oil prices later this year. 
""This approach comes amid a spreading Delta variant, which is still impacting mobility in certain geographies. Separately, Washington's negotiations with Iran could also quench a substantial portion of expected deficits down the road,"" analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note. 
""A Summer Breakout in energy markets can continue to gather steam with supply artificially constrained."" 
Travel-related stocks jumped 1.9% after falling for four days in a row on fears of more restrictions following a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in Asia and the United Kingdom.
Airlines EasyJet, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Ryanair rose between 1.5% and 4%.
The STOXX 600 was now within 1% of a record high hit in June, as growing optimism over a vaccine-led economic recovery this year saw sentiment jump to a 21-year high.

Figures on Thursday confirmed the euro zone manufacturing sector expanded last month at its fast pace on record.
Germany's DAX rose 0.5% as data showed retail sales in Europe's biggest economy rebounded in May.
Technology stocks, which had outperformed through the pandemic, were the sole losers for the day, down 0.7%. Investors were likely comfortable in pivoting to sectors more exposed to an economic recovery. 
Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY) rose 4.8% as it said third-quarter sales at its Primark fashion stores that reopened after COVID-19 lockdowns were ahead of expectations in all markets.
French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) rose 2.3% after boosting its second-half revenue and profit margin forecasts, betting on the full reopening of U.S. schools.

Sodexo's peer, Denmark's ISS, jumped 6.6% to the top of the STOXX 600, after the news.
Fashion retailer H&M, on the other hand, fell 1.1% as its second-quarter earnings remained well below pre-pandemic levels.

""The race to the bottom in competition is over,"" Scholz told reporters during a visit to Washington shortly after the agreement was reached in talks led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
He said details still needed to be worked out, but the agreement marked ""colossal progress"" and would allow countries to increase investment in infrastructure and efforts to combat climate change. 
Scholz said the 130 countries represented 90% of global gross domestic output and reflected huge efforts by Germany and other countries to ensure fair taxation of big technology corporations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
He said the goal was to ensure that finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies endorse the plan when they meet in Venice July 9-10, following a similar move by the Group of Seven advanced economies in London last month.

""This is the biggest progress in international taxation we have had since 10, 20, 30 years,"" he said. ""It's a really big breakthrough, and it will change everything.""
Scholz said the agreement would help countries ensure they have more funding to pay for ""important priorities"" such as infrastructure, climate change and social spending needs.

While a global semiconductor shortage is to some extent hampering the industry’s growth, the rising adoption of 5G and growing societal taste for smart devices, should help the industry continue growing. Consequently, we think the shares of leading consumer electronics companies Apple (AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY), LG Display (NYSE:LPL), and Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) could be solid bets now.The consumer electronics industry has evolved dramatically in recent years, underpinned by an accelerated pace of digitization, a pandemic-induced remote working culture and virtual learning trends, as well as an increasing demand for smart gadgets and advanced technologies. In fact, increased desire for convenience through smart gadgets and appliances has fueled the industry’s growth as individuals spent more time locked in at home over the past year.
While a global semiconductor shortage is currently retarding the industry’s growth, the consumer electronics market is nonetheless projected to hit $989.37 billion in 2027, growing at a 5.3% CAGR from its 2020 level. With increasing the penetration of Internet of Things (IoT) and continued roll out of 5G networks, the demand for high-end smartphones, tablets, laptops is expected to continue rising.
Because people are expected to continue with digital lifestyles and equip their homes with convenient-to-use devices and smart appliances, the consumer electronics industry is expected to keep growing. As such, we think consumer electronics giants Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sony Corporation (SONY),  LG Display Co . Ltd (LPL), and Sonos, Inc.

For Goldman Sachs’s Neil Mehta, ConocoPhillips is a top big oil pick even as his $68 target is the lowest of the five. According to him, the stock holds an attractive upside given that its current discount to Brent is steeper than the traditional ~$5.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England (BoE) does not have evidence yet to force banks to hold more capital to cover risks from climate change, its Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Thursday.
The BoE is for the first time stress testing how banks and insurers would cope with meeting the United Kingdom's net zero climate goals at different speeds, but the results won't affect capital requirements, unlike its routine stress test.
""We do not currently have the evidence base to directly include say certain types of mortgages that should carry a higher risk weight because of their climate risk, we just don't have that,"" Woods told a London Climate Action Week event.
Over time he expects the price banks charge polluting industries for loans will go up to reflect the risks from climate change, Woods said.
""When we look around today we try and find evidence of those risks being factored into prices of various kinds in financial markets, we can't see much,"" Woods said.
Banks have faced protests over their financing of polluting industries such as mining, but Woods said it would be ""overreach"" for the BoE to penalise the flow of finance towards carbon heavy industry.

""What we can do ... is say to the firms that we regulate that first of all you need to have an understanding of what your exposures look like in this respect,"" Woods said.
""In light of that, how can you demonstrate to us that you are appropriately capitalised for those risks and that you are on top of it,"" he added.

Thelios is a joint venture between LVMH and Italian spectacle maker Marcolin, in which the luxury group holds a 51% stake. 
The Autumn/Winter 2021 collection will be the first to be launched under the new partnership and will include both prescription and sun glasses, the two companies said in a joint press release.

Part of the broader strategy by Paris-based LVMH to expand in eyewear, Thelios produces and distributes glasses for other brands in the group, including Dior, Stella McCartney and Kenzo. 
The announcement comes the day after the end of Fendi's licensing deal with Italy's Safilo.
Safilo, the world's second-biggest spectacle maker, has been hit by LVMH's decision to end previous agreements between the two firms and set up the joint-venture with Marcolin.

(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Thursday it expects to administer fewer COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter after inoculations peaked in the previous quarter, sending its shares down nearly 7%.
Walgreens had been relying on gains from administering COVID-19 vaccines to tide over losses from low prescription volumes and a weak flu season that has hampered over-the-counter sales of health and wellness products in recent quarters. 
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, among the largest U.S. pharmacies, administered 17 million vaccines in the third quarter, helping it beat analysts' sales estimates. Overall, 25 million shots have been given to Americans through Walgreens, 7.6% of all U.S. vaccinations. 
The company now expects to administer 28 million vaccinations in 2021, with around seven million in the fourth quarter compared to 17 million in the third quarter.
The company had earlier planned to administer 26 million to 34 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2021.
""This quarter was peak quarter for (COVID-19) vaccinations,"" Chief executive Officer James Kehoe said, adding that a slowdown in vaccination rate was also due to U.S. President Joe Biden's push to have 70% of adults receive at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by July 4.
The company said it anticipates a slower growth in earnings per share in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter. 
Same-store prescriptions filled at Walgreens' pharmacies rose 9.8% in the quarter, including a 6% boost from COVID-19 vaccines. 
The company raised its 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth forecast from mid-to-high single digit to around 10%.

Revenue rose 12.1% to $34.0 billion in the quarter, ahead of estimates of $33.8 billion.
Shares of rival drugstore chains Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) were also down marginally.

Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) rose 1% Thursday on a stock swap repurchase program, revised terms for cheaper loans, and more cruises getting launched.
Carnival is undertaking a two-step exercise under which the U.S. company, Carnival Corp, is selling its equity to raise up to $500 million in an at-the-market offering.
Carnival Corp could use the same money to buy 18.38 million shares of U.K.-based Carnival Plc (LON:CCL), an effort that could go on till January 31 next year. 
The U.S. unit intends to sell the shares in the offering only when the ordinary shares of Carnival Plc are trading in a U.K. market at a discount to shares of common stock of Carnival Corp. As a result, both would derive an economic benefit from the offering and the use of proceeds.

Conversely, investors should avoid Vulcan (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM), which are trading at sky-high valuations that we don’t think are justified by their near-term growth prospects. Let’s examine these names.Because traditional infrastructure like roads, bridges and ports need regular maintenance and upgrades, it’s no surprise that the infrastructure sector has been enjoying renewed investor attention with the economy’s reopening.

Eaton Corporation plc (ETN) and Oshkosh Corporation (OSK) are two fundamentally sound stocks in the infrastructure space that we think have the potential to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

Let’s discuss why in more detail.Many investors jumped out of expensive growth stocks and into quality cyclical stocks earlier this year to capitalize on the economic recovery. But investors’ interest in growth stocks has been returning lately.

People’s gradual return to “analog” lifestyles as COVID-19 restrictions are removed, along with continued fiscal and monetary policy support for economies, should help many stocks generate solid growth in the coming quarters.
The Fed has said that it expects to make at least two interest rate hikes in late 2023 but has left interest rates unchanged for now. Furthermore, the Conference Board expects U.S. real GDP growth to be 6.6% in 2021. These factors should bode well for growth-focused stocks.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Fashion retailer H&M's global sales growth slowed in the second half of June and the Swedish company took a sales hit in China after its concerns over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang led to a social media inspired boycott by shoppers.
The world's second-largest fashion retailer on Thursday reported a stronger-than-expected profit for its March-May quarter, after a loss in the same quarter last year.
In China, sales were down 23% in local currencies when H&M was wiped off Tmall and domestic phonemakers' app stores in March after the retailer expressed concerns https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/h-m-group-statement-on-due-diligence about the alleged Xinjiang human rights abuses.
""With regards to China the situation remains complex. Beyond that we refer to what we have said before,"" Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said, as H&M quantified for the first time the impact of the China boycott, which started on social media.
China accounted for around 5% of group sales last year and is one of H&M's two top suppliers.
H&M in late March said in a statement https://hmgroup.com/news/statement_hm_china it was dedicated to regaining the trust of customers and partners China and that its commitment to the country remained strong. 
Helmersson said H&M was closely following the situation in Bangladesh - another main supplier - after a spike in coronavirus cases prompted the country enforce a strict lockdown, although garment factories remain open.
PATCHY RECOVERY
Group sales for June 1-28 were up a quarter year-on-year but 4% lower than in pre-pandemic 2019 as growth slowed from mid June, highlighting a patchy recovery from the pandemic.
Helmersson, speaking to analysts and reporters, attributed the easing in the second half of June to a combination of factors, including tough year-ago and 2019 comparisons, cold weather last week in some European markets, and how coronavirus restrictions were being eased.
""We see signals of a strong recovery also in June, and that customers appreciate our collections,"" she told Reuters. 
Analysts said the figures implied sales were down 9% on 2019 in the latter two weeks of June, and noted that rival Primark has also said trading was currently very volatile from week to week.
""Recent weeks of trading highlight a mixed demand rebuild,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst James Grzinic.
H&M's shares were down 1.8% at 1437 GMT.
Quarterly pretax profit was 3.59 billion crowns ($419 million) against a year-earlier loss of 6.48 billion. 
""As more and more people are vaccinated and restrictions are eased, the world is gradually opening up and customers can once again visit our stores,"" Helmersson said. ""Online sales have continued to develop very well even as the stores have opened.""
H&M said 95 of its 5,000 stores globally remained temporarily closed, against 1,300 at the start of March. 
Chief Financial Officer Adam Karlsson said the company was not unaffected by rising freight rates due to a global shipping backlog but it expected to mitigate them.
H&M said prospects of paying a dividend for 2020 in the autumn were now very good, after it failed to propose one at its annual general meeting in May.

Also on Thursday, Primark raised its profit outlook after better-than-expected store sales across markets.

SUNDERLAND, England (Reuters) -Nissan Motor Co bet on Britain to supercharge its European electric future on Thursday, pledging $1.4 billion with its Chinese partner to build a giant battery plant that will power 100,000 vehicles a year including a new crossover model.
Facing the most profound technological shift in a century, the titans of the auto industry are racing to secure battery supply close to the factories where they will make the new cleaner electric vehicles of the future.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) cast its backing for the 9 gigawatt-hour (GWh) plant as illustrative of a rejuvenation of Britain's automotive industry, which has for five years grappled with the fear that Brexit could cut off the rest of the European market.
""This project is the demonstration of the renaissance of the British car industry,"" Ashwani Gupta, Nissan's chief operating officer, told reporters at the Sunderland plant, which exports 70% of its vehicles to the European Union.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Nissan's move was ""a major vote of confidence in the UK and our highly skilled workers in the North East"". Nissan said Britain had backed the plan, but did not detail any guarantees or incentives.
The 1 billion-pound ($1.4 billion) investment by Nissan, its Chinese partner Envision AESC and local government in northeast England will create 6,200 jobs at the Sunderland plant and in British supply chains.
Nissan will spend up to 423 million pounds to produce a new-generation all-electric crossover vehicle at the plant, where it already produces the LEAF electric vehicle and the Qashqai crossover SUV. The new vehicle has yet to be named and there is no launch date. 
ELECTRIC FUTURE
As world powers try to slash carbon emissions by scrapping the fossil-fuel guzzling internal combustion engine, Britain has pledged to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2030.
Going electric, though, is hard.
China dominates the production of electric vehicle batteries and the processing of the minerals used to make them, though the United States and Europe are trying to catch up.
Western leaders, including Johnson, are loath to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of automotive jobs - often in politically sensitive constituencies - by importing batteries from China, rather than manufacturing domestically.
And unless Britain can build both battery production and supply chains, it risks losing its four-decade reputation as the investor-friendly gateway for top companies seeking to export to the rest of Europe.
Envision could invest an additional 1.8 billion pounds in the battery plant to expand generating capacity to up to 25GWh and create 4,500 new jobs in the region by 2030. There is potential on site for up to 35GWh.
""We also want to build the supply ecosystem in the country - but you do need critical mass,"" Zhang Lei, Envision Group founder and chief executive, told Reuters. 
Zhang said the battery plant could supply other manufacturers and hoped that, once it expanded capacity, it would be able to export, including to Europe.
Still, Britain is far short of the installed battery capacity it will need to power electric cars in the long term and there are risks the technology will be superseded.
""Battery development and production is currently in a complete state of flux - chaos even,"" said Bob Hancké, associate professor of political economy at the London School of Economics. ""Any investment now runs the risk of closing of technologically more advanced options a few years from now."" 
Nissan said the new crossover, to be built on the Alliance CMF-EV platform shared by partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi, would be exported to European markets.
BREXIT 
Japan's capital has used Britain as a gateway to Europe since the early 1980s, when then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher persuaded Nissan to build a plant in Sunderland on an old airfield.
Japanese investors worried the Brexit vote - which was particularly strong in Sunderland - would scupper their bets.
A new trade deal agreed with the EU last year allows the free trade of cars but with a dangerous twist about rules of origin - at least 40% of the value of a car has to be produced in the United Kingdom or EU to be sold in the bloc.
That requirement rises to 55% from 2027 - a crucial detail that would mean an imported battery, which can make up half the vehicle's sale price, would close off the European market to British-based car factories.
The new model takes Nissan's total capital investment in the Sunderland plant past 5 billion pounds.

""This is not one shot, this is not one car, this is the plan and this is for 10 years' engagement,"" Guillaume Cartier, Nissan chairman for Africa, Middle East, India, Europe & Oceania, told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog has barred major cryptocurrency exchange Binance from carrying out regulated activities, the latest in a string of moves against the platform by authorities across the world.
Here are answers to some key questions on Binance, one of the world's biggest exchanges, and what the latest regulatory moves mean.
HOW BIG IS BINANCE? 
Very. 
Trading volumes in June were $662 billion, up almost ten-fold from July 2020, according to data from CryptoCompare. On a single day in May, daily volumes hit $92 billion, U.S. researcher Coin Metrics said.
Headed by Canadian Changpeng Zhao, Binance offers a wide range of services to users across the globe, from crypto spot and derivatives trading to tokenised versions of stocks. 
It also runs an exchange that allows users to trade directly with each other. Its own cryptocurrency, Binance Coin, is the fourth-biggest in the world. 
Binance is growing in popularity in Britain, where its app has been downloaded 1.8 million times in 2021, and 2.2 million times in total, according to mobile data firm Sensor Tower.
WHERE'S IT BASED?
It's unclear.
Binance's corporate structure is opaque, with its holding company widely reported to be registered in the Cayman Islands. A Binance spokesperson declined to comment on its location, saying it was ""decentralised"" and that it ""works with a number of regulated entities around the world"".
Binance has built up a huge following across the world, with channels on the Telegram social media app for users in more than 30 countries. 
AND IT'S COMING UNDER SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS? 
Yes - in Britain and elsewhere.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last week Binance's UK arm cannot conduct any regulated activity, without saying why it took the action.
Crypto trading is generally unregulated in Britain, though some activities such as offering crypto derivatives do require permission. 
Regulators including the FCA are increasingly worried over the standard of anti-money laundering checks at crypto exchanges and the risks crypto trading poses to consumers. 
Japan's regulator said last week Binance was operating in the country illegally, while Germany's watchdog said in April it risked being fined for offering tokens connected to stocks. In May, Bloomberg reported Binance is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.
Yet national regulators often struggle to rein in crypto exchanges based elsewhere, lawyers said. 
""It's very difficult,"" said Simon Treacy, senior lawyer at Linklaters. ""(The FCA) don't have jurisdiction over the whole of Binance's operations, so they use the point where they do have jurisdiction and put pressure on the business there.""
The Binance spokesperson said it takes its compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to following all regulatory requirements wherever it operates.
HOW WILL THE UK MOVE IMPACT BINANCE?
Its influence may be limited.
Beyond a loud warning to investors, the FCA has done all it can under its limited powers over an offshore exchange, experts say.
""At the moment the method is to emphasise risks to investors in the UK of these services rather than to regulate them outright,"" said Barney Reynolds, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling.
UK investors can still access Binance via its main website, which the FCA does not have powers over.
Still, the FCA's demand that Binance seeks its permission to offer regulated services means it would be an offence to suggest to investors it was regulated in the UK.
Binance will also have to rethink plans announced last year to offer crypto trading services using pounds and euros on a platform regulated by the UK. 

Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said this week it would only allow FCA-authorised entities to run ads for UK-based financial products on its website, after repeated FCA calls to crack down on online fraud.
Concern at banks over investment scams and fraud involving crypto exchanges may also impact Binance. Britain's Natwest Group last week capped the daily amount customers can send to exchanges, including Binance.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Strained trade relations between China and Australia have prompted Chinese importers to buy more U.S. beef, making room for Brazil to increase exports to the United States, trade data show. 
The trend helps  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), Marfrig Global Foods SA and Minerva SA (OTC:MRVSY), which have multiple plants approved to ship products to the United States and could benefit from more export permits. 
In the five months to May, Brazilian beef shipments to the U.S. market rose 165.6% to 33,800 tonnes, according to Brazilian 
beef lobby Abiec. Exports surged 186% in May alone, making the United States the third biggest foreign buyer of Brazilian beef. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show the United States sold 48,292 tonnes of beef to China from January to April, up sharply from 3,255 tonnes in the same period of 2020. 
""We expect the U.S. will direct part of its meat to China to offset the reduction in exports from Australia to that country,"" said Lygia Pimentel, director of agribusiness consultancy Agrifatto. 
""With this, Brazil ends up gaining space in the U.S. market.""
Brazil's pork export to the United States may also benefit from the trend, she said. 
JBS has 12 units authorized to export to the United States and is looking at ways to expand that trade, the company told Reuters. Last week, Brazil's Agriculture Ministry cleared a Marfrig plant in Rondonia state for exports to the United States. That unit and another one in Rio Grande do Sul are now awaiting approval from U.S. authorities to begin exporting. 

Marfrig said it already exports fresh and processed beef to the United States from four plants in Brazil. 
Rival Minerva was authorized last week to export cooked and frozen products to the U.S. market from a facility in Sao Paulo state, the company's sixth plant cleared for beef exports to the United States.

So, let’s discuss these names.The marijuana industry has been gaining wider acceptance in the United States, with an increasing number of states legalizing cannabis for medical, recreational and other uses, eliminating the stigma once associated with its use. In fact, investors’ and analysts’ renewed confidence in the cannabis space has been buoyed by ongoing discussion around decriminalization of cannabis at the federal level.
So far, 18 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use of marijuana. And with more states likely to legalize recreational marijuana in the coming months, the prospects of companies operating in this space look bright, and they are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to expand.
Furthermore, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler’s reintroduction of the MORE Act amid a strong call for federal level reform from social justice advocacy groups also bodes well for marijuana companies. As such, analysts are extremely bullish about the cannabis industry. Based on consensus price targets, Columbia Care Inc. (CCHWF) and Greenlane Holdings, Inc.

Last month, Morrisons - Britain's fourth largest supermarket group after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda - rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pound ($7.62 billion)cash offer from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).
However, shares in the grocer, which trades from about 500 UK stores and employs 118,000, have since risen by over a third on hopes of a raised bid from CD&R or offers from other private equity suitors or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Asda was taken private in February, when Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity group TDR Capital completed their purchase of a majority stake from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
""There is concern that regulatory bodies have insufficient oversight or powers to intervene when new owners act irresponsibly,"" Darren Jones, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker and chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said in a letter to Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
He noted previous purchases of high street brands using significant amounts of debt, which have ultimately resulted in administration, job losses and pension fund shortfalls.
""Can you please set out which (if any) issues here merit further consideration by the CMA? Please could you also advise what powers you currently have to deal with such issues, and/ or identify what new powers you think ought to be considered so that these issues can be addressed?""
Last week Labour called on the government to confirm it will intervene in any private equity takeover of Morrisons to secure binding commitments about the buyer’s business plan, on jobs and on pensions.
The government has powers to intervene in takeovers of companies on grounds including competition, media plurality, national security and pandemic response.

However, Labour wants the government to have powers to intervene where an acquisition may have long-term implications for the United Kingdom’s industrial strategy.

The move will see the bank offering the maximum amount of remote working allowed by an industry-wide contract in Italy. 
Prior to the pandemic, UniCredit staff at its various central offices could decide to work remotely for up to one day a week on average, a spokesperson for the bank said.
Companies across the world are gauging how much flexibility to let employees retain following often months of working from home during COVID-19 lockdowns. 
Swiss bank UBS said on Monday it would let most staff adopt hybrid working patterns, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has said it expects most staff at its Manhattan headquarters to return to the office by September.
UniCredit will also let branch employees work from home for one day a week if they want to and their role allows it, the spokesperson said.
Lando Mario Sileoni, the head of Italy's main banking union FABI, welcomed the move, which was first announced in an interview to Bloomberg News by UniCredit's Chief Operating Officer Ranieri de Marchis.

""This is an important first step in the right direction ... to give workers the chance, once the emergency is over, to go back to the office or partly work remotely ... in line with the national contract that says workers can opt for up to 10 days a month of remote working,"" Sileoni said.

Below is a summary of Elliott's proposals.
ENSURING 'RIGHT' LEADERSHIP
Elliott wants GSK to appoint non-executive directors with deep biopharma and consumer healthcare expertise prior to a separation of the consumer business expected in mid-2022.
The fund wants GSK's reinforced board to run ""robust processes"" for selecting leadership for the two new companies created by the split, considering both internal and external candidates. Elliott said it was also prepared to share a list of candidates it had identified.
INCENTIVISATION OF TARGETS
The fund said the portion of GSK's compensation plan linked to financial targets should be ""substantial."" 
GSK's outlook to increase sales by more than 5% a year to 2026 and for a more than 10% increase in operating profit should be the base for considering bonuses, it said. 
Elliott also suggested GSK should explore linking part of the compensation to longer-term guidance for executives. 
PROFITABILITY AND INVESTMENTS
Elliott endorsed New GSK, the pharmaceuticals business, prioritising investments in its pipeline, adding that such an approach should continue along with the ""much-needed"" cost-savings plan being implemented.
""New GSK's profitability target of more than 30% operating profit margins by 2026 is a welcome step in the right direction. However, it does not go far enough,"" Elliott said.
It recommended that New GSK target a 32% operating profit margin by 2026.
OPENNESS TO OPTIONS
Elliott said there were high potential synergies for some transactions, including a sale of the consumer business, adding that GSK should remain open to the possibility of shifting away from its current plan.
""Any strategic opportunity for the sale of CH consumer health) should be diligently pursued and accompanied by a clear plan for how GSK will use the proceeds,"" the investor said, urging GSK to ""impartially"" consider opportunities. 
VACCINES AND PHARMA 
Elliott said New GSK's vaccines and pharmaceuticals businesses should not be fully integrated because it was not convinced of ""clear synergies"" between the two.

Providing the vaccines division more autonomy could increase talent retention and ""nimbleness,"" Elliott said, adding that a separate divisional reporting structure would allow investors to appropriately value GSK's ""crown jewel"" vaccines unit.
Elliott made clear that it was not recommending a sale of the vaccines business, the world's leader by revenues.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Investor Elliott wants GSK leadership settled before split,"By Keith Weir
LONDON (Reuters) -Activist investor Elliott said GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) should review its leadership and consider a sale of its consumer healthcare business as it confirmed on Thursday that it had taken a significant stake in the British pharmaceuticals group.
GSK last week set out plans for a separate listing next year of the consumer health business, which includes brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, in the biggest shake-up for the company in two decades.
In a strongly worded letter to the GSK board, setting out five recommendations to tackle what it called years of underperformance, Elliott raised the pressure on Chief Executive Emma Walmsley while endorsing the planned split.
The hedge fund said GSK should add pharmaceutical and scientific expertise to its board and then decide who should run the two businesses, looking at internal and external candidates.
""Elliott strongly believes that the future CEOs of New GSK and CH must have the skillsets and expertise to match their respective tasks at hand,"" adding that existing management should remain in place for now.
Elliott's response had been awaited after reports in April that it had taken a multi-billion pound stake.
""Despite possessing strong businesses in attractive markets, GSK has failed to capture business opportunities due to years of under-management,"" Elliott said.
SEPARATION PLANNED
In its initial response, GSK said Elliott was raising ""legacy issues"".
GSK's ""ambitious"" plan was set out to realise significant value over the next decade, a spokesperson for the British company said.
""We believe our shareholders are supportive of this strategy, and that they are focused on GSK executing on it without distraction or delay. This is our clear priority,"" they added, saying a more detailed response would follow. 
The split will allow GSK to focus on its core drugs and vaccines business, which has been hit by a lack of fast-growing products and patients deferring treatments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, weighing on its shares.
Walmsley, who has led GSK since 2017, said last week that GSK shares had underperformed for a long period and that she planned to stay on to lead the pharma and vaccines business.
The shares were up around 0.7% on Thursday.
""Our analysis suggests that GSK has an opportunity to generate up to 45% upside in its share price in the lead-up to its full separation, and much more in the years beyond,"" Elliott said.

It also urged GSK to look at a full sale of the consumer health business, a joint venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), should the opportunity arise and grant the vaccines business more autonomy within new GSK.
""Providing vaccines more autonomy could increase its talent retention and nimbleness ... maintaining separate divisional reporting for vaccines will allow investors to appropriately value GSK's crown jewel vaccines business,"" Elliott said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock market listings hit their highest level for 14 years in the first half of 2021 as unprecedented monetary stimulus and pent-up demand for growth companies created fertile conditions for companies to go public. 
But a number of pulled deals in recent weeks has cast doubt the willingness and ability of investors to continue to absorb such bumper levels of issuance. 
Led by tech companies, European initial public offerings (IPO) hit their highest level for a first half of the year since before the financial crisis, with companies raising $43.2 billion through listings, according to Refinitiv data.
The figure has skyrocketed from $5.4 billion last year and $8.7 billion in 2019, pre-pandemic.
Overall stock market fundraising in Europe, which includes secondary share issues via rights issues and overnight block trades, hit $143.05 billion, the highest on record. 
""The first quarter of the year saw sublime market conditions for IPOs,"" said James Fleming, co-head of global equity capital markets at Citi, a sentiment echoed by other bankers in similar roles across the street, with some saying they had never seen better conditions. 
""We didn't expect IPOs would come back quite so strongly - it was a massive pivot into growth stocks from investors. We have had a lot of issuance but investors remain engaged,"" said Rob Leach, head of equity capital markets for Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
Unprecedented monetary support from central banks around the world, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, pushed world stocks to record highs and encouraged more risk-taking by investors. 
A global economy battered by the fallout of the COVID-19 crisis meant that much of this was directed towards growth investments such as tech stocks. 
Companies such as Polish logistics firm InPost, German online car retailer Auto1 and classic British boot brand Dr Martens issued into this flying market. 
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s towers unit Vantage Towers raised 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in the largest German deal since 2018, Britain's Deliveroo raised 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) and Acciona Energia raised 1.5 billion euros in the biggest Spanish IPO since 2015.

SCALE MATTERS
Speculation that policymakers could pull back some of that support due to progress in vaccination drives took the edge off the market as the year progressed. 
Meal delivery app Deliveroo priced its London IPO at the top of the range, for a valuation of 7.6 billion pounds ($10.53 billion) at the end of March, and saw its shares plummet 30% on debut, a record first day drop.
Since then the IPO market has been active, but choosy. 
""IPOs have to be prepared thoughtfully and it will remain selective, which is exactly how it should be,"" said Leach of Jefferies. ""You should as far as possible de-risk the entire process, address investor concerns and explore valuation. If that process is handled correctly, there should not be any bad surprises,"" he said. 
There were a few such bad surprises in May and June, with the likes of Primafrio, PHE, Marex Spectron, Nordgold and Huvepharma pulling IPO attempts and others such as Alphawave and Made.com trading down in the aftermarket. 
Bankers on some of those deals said size was an issue for investors; if the company was not big enough to reach the big indexes, there was a significant drop in interest. 
""Scale is a factor investors focus on in very busy markets and inclusion into (indexes such as) the FTSE 250 will help liquidity and demand at the outset,"" said Barry Meyers, Head of UK and Ireland Equity Capital Markets at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""Naturally there are some signs of investor fatigue now given the record issuance we have seen, but the fundamental issuance drivers remain intact,"" he added.  
Even larger companies are having to manage expectations, with the much-anticipated IPO of the renewable unit of Spain's Acciona pricing at the bottom of an indicative price range, a level its chief executive said was ""not optimal"".
But there is still a packed pipeline with bankers expecting roughly 30 IPO launches in the September/October window, insisting that liquidity is not an issue. 
""For investors, the growth nexus remains very strong: we expect tech, healthcare, fintech and renewables to be well represented for the rest of the year,"" said Fleming of Citi. 
While the pickiness of investors is a tricky path for issuers to manage, the question of central bank policy will hang over the market, with both the Fed and the European Central Bank expected to resume the ""tapering"" discussion in September. 

Participants could come back to a very different market after the summer.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday blocked a recently-enacted Florida law that was meant to authorize the state to penalize social media companies when they ban political candidates, with the judge saying the law likely violated free speech rights.
U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law, which was scheduled to go into effect Thursday. 
""This order preliminarily enjoins enforcement of the parts of the legislation that are preempted or violate the First Amendment"", the judge said in the order filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District Of Florida.
""The plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claim that these statutes violate the First Amendment,"" Hinkle wrote. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees citizens the right to free speech.
Two tech trade groups had filed a lawsuit against Florida in May over the new law.
The lawsuit said the bill signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, in May was unconstitutional. It was filed by internet lobbying groups NetChoice and Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA). The groups' members include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
Florida was going to be the first state to regulate how social media companies moderated online speech. The new law would have made it easier for Florida's attorney general and others in the state to sue the tech companies over claims that platforms have imposed content moderation on users unfairly or inconsistently.

The law was criticized by internet law experts as unconstitutional and as pre-empted by Section 230, a federal law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users.
Former President Donald Trump, also a Republican, was blocked on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after the platforms banned or suspended him over risks of further violence following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters. The ban added to Republicans' long-standing accusations that online platforms censor content due to anti-conservative bias.

Set up by former Rosenberg Equities chief executive Heidi Ridley and former head of sustainable investing Kathryn McDonald, HSBC said it would take up to a 33% stake in RadiantESG, which will rebrand as RadiantESG Global Investors.
Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.
RadiantESG said it intends to launch two strategies later in the year, one a broad listed equity strategy focusing on global developed and emerging market stocks, the second focused on 'planet-positive' stocks which contribute strongly towards fulfilling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Both would target institutional and wealth management clients, initially in the United States with the aim of eventually launching products aimed at retail investors.
McDonald, who along with Ridley spent two decades at quant-driven investment house Rosenberg Equities, part of AXA Investment Managers, said while quant investing had many strengths, patchy ESG data from corporates meant the firm would not be able to rely on it completely.
""We have to be honest with ourselves that quant methodology is not sufficient... we have to temper that with our own human judgement.""
Ridley said the tie-up with HSBC, which manages $621 billion in assets, would hopefully allow the firm to scale quickly, enabling it to capture a bigger slice of institutional money looking to allocate to women and minority-led businesses.
The Kresge Foundation, for example, said in 2019 that by 2025, a quarter of its U.S. assets under management would be invested with female- and diverse-owned firms.
While a number of such firms have launched in recent years the majority are quite small, with an operating infrastructure that can make it harder for them to attract capital from larger institutions.

""We would rather give away part of the equity and partner with a firm that can help us meet those demands and really address some asset owner concerns about operational and going concern risk, such that we can hopefully accelerate our path to growth,"" said Ridley.
Of the $69 trillion in assets in the United States, only 1.4% is managed by diverse-owned firms, a 2020 study from the Diverse Asset Managers Initiative showed.

(Reuters) -Doughnut chain Krispy Kreme priced its initial public offering well below the planned range to raise $500 million, indicating a lukewarm reception from investors during one of the busiest weeks for stock market debuts in the United States.
The company priced 29.4 million shares at $17 each, below the $21 to $24 per share range it had set earlier. The IPO valued it at $2.7 billion.
Known for its iconic glazed doughnuts, Krispy Kreme will start trading during one of the busiest weeks of 2021 for U.S. IPOs, with at least 17 companies scheduled to enter the market. 
In what was the biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese company since 2014, China's Didi Global Inc debuted on Wednesday with a valuation of more than $68 billion at close. 
Krispy Kreme had previously planned to sell about 26.7 million shares, its earlier filing showed. With those terms, it would have raised $640 million at the top end of the range.
Krispy Kreme opened its first store in North Carolina in 1937 when it started selling doughnuts in local grocery stores. Their business also includes cookie chain Insomnia Cookies, and k-cups for Keurig.
It sold 1.3 billion donuts across 30 countries in fiscal 2020, capping the highest level of sales in the brand's history, with net revenues of $1.1 billion.
It first went public in 2000 but its unit had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005.

The IPO would mark Krispy Kreme's return to U.S. stock markets five years after it was taken private by Keurig parent company JAB Holding Co in a $1.35 billion deal in 2016.
The company intends to list on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the ticker symbol ""DNUT"".J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the lead book-running managers for the offering.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Krafton, the company behind blockbuster video game ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG), cut its IPO target by nearly a quarter on Thursday after a regulator warned it needed to revise its filings.
The company, which counts Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd as its second-biggest shareholder, has revised the indicative price range for its 8.7 million share offering to 400,000-498,000 won per share.
At the top end of the range, the offering would raise 4.3 trillion won ($3.8 billion). That compares to its previous target of as much as 5.6 trillion won which if it had been reached would have been a record for South Korean IPOs.
South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service had told Krafton last week to resubmit its paperwork though it did not disclose the reasons behind the order. 
Krafton, which derives 97% of its operating profit from its online multiplayer war-fighting game, said in a statement that it had discussed the matter with its advisers ""so that we could receive a reasonable market evaluation.""
""Krafton's initial IPO pricing was too high considering the fact that most of the company's revenue comes from a single game,"" said Hwang Hyun-jun, an analyst at DB Financial Investment. 
""There were also some concerns about the royalties it receives from China, which led authorities to advise the company to revise down the IPO price,"" he said.
Krafton is planning to release two PUBG-related games this year - a mobile game ""PUBG: New State"" and ""Battlegrounds Mobile India"".

The company is also expanding to areas such as web-based cartoons, movies and animation.
It reported 1.67 trillion won in revenue in 2020, up 54% from a year earlier and its operating profit more than doubled to 774 billion won.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 06:17AM ET</span>",Concrete makers face heavy lift on climate pledges,"By Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Cemex, North America’s biggest concrete producer, has vowed to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 40% before 2030 and to eliminate them by 2050, ambitious goals reflecting growing pressure on the industry from regulators and investors.
But steep challenges in technology, cost-control, environmental regulation and building-code compliance could snarl the effort, underscoring the difficulty in cleaning up an industry that is among the world’s biggest greenhouse-gas emitters, according to interviews with Cemex officials, cement and concrete industry groups and specialists in industry emissions.
Cement, a key ingredient in concrete, contributes about 8% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to Chatham House, a London think tank. That’s far more than global aviation, according to data from the Air Transport Action Group, an industry group. The cement industry produces more CO2 than any nation except for the United States, China and India, according to the International Energy Agency. (See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3dq4PPN.)
The industry emits carbon dioxide at every step of the manufacturing and supply chain, making it particularly difficult to reduce emissions. The CO2 pollution starts with mining of limestone and continues with the chemical process used to turn it into cement, the power for factories and kilns, and the fuels for shipping it worldwide for projects from patios to skyscrapers.
The challenges facing Cemex are common across the industry, and other major cement and concrete makers - including Breedon Group, Asia Cement and UltraTech Cement - have set similar targets for producing “carbon-neutral” concrete. Cemex may have a harder time than some firms, however, because construction codes in the United States - one of its most important markets - don’t allow many alternative cement ingredients that could lower manufacturing emissions.
Skeptics of the industry pledges say the companies are relying largely on carbon-capture technology that remains unproven and uneconomical. Further, they contend, the companies can’t meet their climate goals without the cooperation of regulators, architects, builders and consumers all enabling the shift to lower-carbon processes and materials.
""We're talking about some really, really ambitious goals for what is arguably the hardest industrial sector to decarbonize,” said Gaurav Sant, an engineering professor at UCLA and director of its Institute for Carbon Management. ""Pending major technological breakthroughs, it's not clear to me how they're going to be met.”
The Cemex pledge applies only to its concrete, not its cement. But meeting the concrete goals will necessarily involve major emissions reductions in cement-making, which produces the bulk of the industry’s CO2 emissions.
Cemex and other companies also plan to use offsetting programs to meet their goals. That involves separate investments in projects that reduce emissions - such as mass tree-plantings or solar-power farms - to offset the carbon produced by polluting industries. Cemex, however, said offsetting will represent only a small portion of its planned reductions.
The central challenge facing the cement industry reflects that facing all polluters: Cutting emissions without cutting profits. Cement sells so well, after all, because it’s relatively cheap. The sector's growth also depends on demand from developing countries, where builders can ill-afford more costly materials.
CEMEX has a new concrete, branded Vertua, that’s made with lower-emission products and processes that sells mostly in Europe. But it costs up to 50% more, a premium the company says can be justified by faster drying times that speed construction.
Cemex says it can meet its climate goals by using renewable energy, carbon-capture technology, and alternative fuels in the kilns used to make cement. Davidé Zampini, Cemex director of Research and development, said the company is “quite confident” it can meet or exceed its environmental goals “if we do some technologies right, and we really hit a home run.”
That confidence prompted the company in June to raise its goal for emissions reductions by 2030 to 40% from 35%. Cemex said it plans to spend $60 million annually on that effort.
Cemex officials acknowledge, however, that success relies on further development of carbon-capture technology and on favorable regulatory regimes in nations where it operates to encourage waste recycling, alternative fuels and greener cement and concrete ingredients.
“We will actively advocate in our markets” for such regulatory changes, said Cemex Chief Executive Fernando González in a virtual presentation in June.
MOUNTING PRESSURE
Governments and investors worldwide are pressuring companies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Billionaire climate activist Bill Gates recently put cement in the spotlight when he called it the most concerning sector in the effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
Concrete is the world’s most popular man-made building material. Cement makes up between 10% and 15% of the typical concrete mix but produces much of its CO2 emissions.
The emissions start with mining raw materials such as limestone and crushing it to prepare for a process called calcination. That process - a huge source of CO2 - involves heating the raw materials in massive kilns, often powered by coal or natural gas, at temperatures up to 1,450C (2,642F). The heating produces marble-sized balls known as clinker, which are then ground up and mixed with other ingredients to make cement.
Cemex officials said the company plans to lower emissions in part by using clinker substitutes that are byproducts of other industrial processes, such as burnt shale oil or glass furnace slag.
It plans to eventually outfit plants with carbon-capture technology, which aims to capture emissions from industrial activity and store the CO2 underground. Oil firms also use captured carbon by injecting it into wells to release oil.
Cement and concrete firms sometimes get help from governments along with the pressure to reduce emissions. Cemex, for instance, was recently awarded $6.5 million in U.S. federal grants to develop carbon-capture technology. 
Other times governments put up obstacles to cleaning up the concrete business. In Mexico, where Cemex is based, President Andes Manuel Lopez Obrador has other priorities. The administration encourages the use of oil-and-gas from state oil firm Pemex. The administration doesn’t specifically oppose renewable energy, but its policies favor domestic companies over foreign firms, which has slowed development of renewables.
That makes it unlikely that more renewable energy will be available or affordable to companies such as Cemex under the administration, said Vicente Saisó, the firm’s sustainability director.
""It's a very tough situation we are facing,"" Saisó said.
Lopez Obrador’s office declined to comment. 
RESTRICTIVE U.S. BUILDING CODES
Cemex officials said their plans for climate-friendly concrete would also require major regulatory changes to building codes in the United States, which accounts for about 22% of its sales. Building standards and codes for some U.S. projects can be ""completely restrictive,” Saisó said.
The ingredients in U.S. concrete are typically mandated by local building codes and are based on Portland cement, a common variety since the 19th century. They often do not accommodate new, lower-carbon mixes that companies including Cemex are developing, Saisó said.
Officials from the U.S.-based Portland Cement Association (PCA) said they support more climate-friendly products but they cited liability fears as a hurdle for architects and engineers in adopting them. Industry experts say concrete products made using greener ingredients are capable of providing the same strength and safety as those using Portland cement.
Cemex has an easier time producing and selling greener concrete products in Europe, where taxation on energy and pollution under the EU’s new Green Deal encourages a switch to cleaner alternatives. The EU also has an emissions trading system that essentially charges facilities for emitting specific amounts of carbon dioxide.

That type of regulation has driven updates to Cemex's European operations, including a more efficient kiln at its plant in Rudniki, Poland, resulting in a 16% drop in carbon dioxide emissions since 2018. The company also has set a higher bar for itself in the region, targeting a 55% emissions reduction by 2030.
""Good regulation that incentivizes us to both remain competitive within Europe, and to drive our carbon reductions, is welcome,"" said Andrew Spencer, vice president of corporate affairs for CEMEX Europe.

Investing.com – CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC) stock plunged 13% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the German drugmaker said final test data showed its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was only 48% effective in preventing the disease.
The German biotech had already said two weeks ago that initial lab results suggested its COVID-19 vaccine, known as CVnCoV, was only 47% effective, adding that new variants of the virus had proved a headwind.
Most vaccines in the market, including those by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which like CureVac's are also based on mRNA technology, have an efficacy of over 85%.
Moderna stock hit a record high this week after tests showed its vaccine was also effective against the delta variant, first identified in India.
The CureVac study involved about 40,000 adult volunteers in Europe and Latin America. Efficacy was 77% in the age group below 60 years of age when considering only moderate to severe symptoms and excluding mild cases.
CureVac said it had sent the data to the European Union drugs regulator. Beyond CVnCoV, the company said it is developing second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).

Investing.com – Micron (NASDAQ:MU) was trading 1.8% lower in Thursday’s premarket trading, as the market reacts negatively to news that it will have to wait until 2024 for a key upgrade to its chipmaking technology.
According to Reuters, the company has stretched out its use of cheaper chipmaking techniques as long as it could but will start using the EUV machines for production in 2024. EUV machines, made by Holland’s ASML, are used to make cutting-edge next gen chips.  ASML's lead times for fulfilling orders have lengthened as chipmakers all scramble to upgrade their production to meet burgeoning demand from new technologies.
For the immediate present, Micron continues to perform well, however. Tight demand for laptops, mobile and other electronic devices that use chips made by Micron led it to report revenue and earnings ahead of expectations in the most recent quarter.
For the fiscal third quarter ended June 3, the company posted revenue of $7.42 billion, up by more than a third from $5.44 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share more than doubled to $1.88 from 82 cents. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.7 on revenue of $7.2 billion.
Micron makes NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market and DRAM memory chips used in data centers, smartphones and other computing devices.
The company has forecast fourth-quarter revenue to come at $8.2 billion plus or minus $200 million. Analysts on average were expecting an outlook for $7.87 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Ahead of the earnings on Wednesday, BMO analysts upgraded the stock to outperform on the expectation that the current situation of demand exceeding supply could last longer and will benefit the memory chipmaker.
Analyst Ambrish Srivastava sees the stock at $110, an upside potential of around 29.4% from the stock’s last close of $84.98.
In a separate announcement, the company said it will sell a plant at Lehi in Utah to Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) for about $1.5 billion. Of the sale consideration, $900 million will be in cash and $600 million will be in the value of tools it can sell to outsiders or move to its other factories.
The company took an impairment charge of $435 million because the $900 million in cash was below the book value of the factory, but Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana told Reuters in an interview that the factory was on track to generate almost $500 million in losses this year because it was underutilized.

LONDON (Reuters) -Primark's sales exceeded pre-pandemic levels and management expectations in its latest quarter as stores reopened after COVID-19 lockdowns and consumers splashed out to update their wardrobes.
The fashion retailer's owner Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY) said Primark's sales were up 207% year-on-year to 1.61 billion pounds ($2.23 billion) in the 16 weeks to June 19, while like-for-like sales were up 3% compared the same period two years ago, before the pandemic hit.
In the same period last year the first lockdowns closed all Primark stores for an average of 12 weeks. Primark has stores across Europe and the United States, but does not trade online. 
This year one in five stores were open at the beginning of the quarter, while all 396 were open at the end.
Shares in AB Foods (LON:ABF) were up 5% at 0837 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 18.5%.
AB Foods finance chief John Bason said the performance reflected an increase in both confidence and willingness to spend by customers compared to previous reopenings after lockdown.
""Some of the fashion is flying off the shelves,"" he told Reuters.
""That is a return to people really wanting to buy things because they're starting to go out again, whereas previously, after the other two lockdowns, it really was all about leisurewear or nightwear or things for the home.""
Bason said Primark had sold out of ""really hot items"", such as pink gingham and purple power blazers and seam-free two-piece sets.
But he noted sales of swimwear for foreign holidays and formalwear were still down, reflecting the lack of overseas travel and people still working from home.
He said data for the total UK clothing market, which includes online sales, for the seven-week period after reopening showed both volume and value share gains for Primark on a two-year basis.
With higher expectations for Primark's final-quarter sales, AB Foods raised its forecast for the division's 2020-21 adjusted operating profit before repayment of government job retention scheme monies to ""broadly in line"" with 2019-20's 362 million pounds, versus previous guidance of ""somewhat lower"".
AB Foods also owns major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses. Third-quarter grocery sales fell 3%, while sugar revenues jumped 21%.

The group now expects full-year adjusted operating profit to be in line with last year's 1 billion pounds.

Credit Suisse's top management are under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan after losing more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos, on the heels of the collapse of $10 billion in funds backed by insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
Former Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Chief Executive Horta-Osorio assumed the role in the midst of these scandals, in late April.
Describing his first seven weeks in the job -- during which he met with employees, as well as Swiss politicians and Swiss, U.S. and British regulators -- as ""intensive,"" Horta-Osorio said the bank needed a realignment that would clear up short-term crises but also position it for the long term.
""I have a clear picture of the direction the bank must take,"" he said in the interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung published on Thursday.
""For me the question isn't, 'what do we need to do to ensure it works this time?' The question is much more, 'why isn't the bank making progress, despite having a fantastic group of wealth management clients in Switzerland, Europe and high-growth Asia?'"" he said, adding the bank's major strength lay in serving entrepreneurs and wealthy families. 
""We need to agree on how we can best serve these customers and on where we are most competitive - on what that means for the bank as a whole,"" he said.
To ensure success, the bank would need not only the right strategic direction, but also ""the right people in the right place,"" he added.
Describing the recent failings at Switzerland's second-largest bank as unacceptable, Horta-Osorio compared the 165-year-old lender to a racecar driving on a highway with its wheels on wrong and promised no quick fixes, saying cultural shifts take time.
Executives fear the longstanding Swiss lender, left vulnerable by scandals, could be challenged by investors demanding its break-up, or that its shrinking stock-market value makes it a target for a foreign hostile takeover, Reuters reported in June.
It is considering centralising the management of its bankers to the world's wealthy, as it looks for ways to tighten controls and improve operations, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
Some executives have debated steps such as spinning off its local Swiss bank to prepare the rest of the business for a merger, pruning back investment banking or selling its asset management business, sources said at the time.

Asked about the future of the investment bank, Horta-Osorio said it was too soon to anticipate the outcome of the board's discussions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission said on Thursday it has reached a deal with Italy on the parameters for separating loss-making carrier Alitalia from its successor, a step key to securing EU approval for the new airline and to write off Alitalia's subsidies.
Brussels and Rome have been in lengthy talks over Alitalia's fate and its successor Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA), demanding that ITA should be independent from the former so that it will not be liable for Alitalia's billions of euros in state aid received in recent years.
Commission Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager met Italy's economy and industry ministers late on Wednesday.
""Following intense and constructive discussions at all levels, the Commission and the Italian authorities have reached a common understanding on the key parameters to ensure economic discontinuity between ITA and Alitalia,"" a Commission spokesperson said. 
The two sides had previously disagreed over ITA ceding half of Alitalia's slots at Milan Linate airport, the old brand and the loyalty programme.
The Commission declined to comment on Rome's plan to extend to December the maturity of a 400-million-euro ($473.9 million)bridge loan granted Alitalia, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters.

""It is for member states to assess whether a measure involves state aid that needs to be notified to the Commission under EU rules,"" the spokesperson said.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 04:21AM ET</span>",Franklin Templeton exec gets relief on India regulator ban,"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian tribunal put on hold on Thursday a directive to ban a senior executive of U.S. money manager Franklin Templeton (FT) after he challenged it saying the market regulator had ""overstepped"" its powers in taking the decision.
Vivek Kudva, head of Asia Pacific distribution at FT, was barred last month by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which said he and his family members used non-public information to sell holdings worth about $4 million in Franklin debt funds that were shut down weeks later and caused investor panic.
The regulator had imposed a one-year market ban on Kudva and his wife and fined them a total of $1 million. It said it was not ""fair conduct"" as Kudva was privy to non-public information. 
In an appeal heard by the Securities Appellate Tribunal on Thursday, Kudva argued he acted only on public information. SEBI objected to his position, but the tribunal judges decided to put the ban on hold while his appeal his heard. 
But Kudva will still need to deposit half of the penalty imposed on him, the tribunal said. 
In his 232-page appeal filing, which was seen by Reuters and is not public, Kudva had argued that Indian law prohibits unfair trade practices, but mutual fund redemptions were not a ""trade"" and were akin to withdrawing one's own money from a bank.
SEBI had ""overstepped its authority and misused the discretion"", while passing its order and there was no reasoning in the regulator's decision ""to justify the draconian directions and restrictions,"" said the filing by Kudva, who has worked at FT for more than 15 years and is a former HSBC executive.
Franklin, part of Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN), manages more than $8 billion for more than 2 million people in India.
Its India unit is locked in a broader legal battle with SEBI after the fund house, considered a fixed income heavyweight, was barred from launching any new debt schemes for two years following a probe into closure of six credit funds in 2020 that the regulator said found ""serious lapses and violations"".
The securities tribunal put that SEBI order on hold this week after hearing Franklin's appeal, but still ordered it to deposit about half of the $68.5 million it had been asked to refund. 
Kudva's and Franklin's appeals will both be heard next on August 30.

In FT's appeal filing, seen by Reuters, the fund house argued it acted in investor interest and followed Indian regulations in winding up the funds, and has distributed nearly three quarters of the assets to the unitholders as of mid-June.
The filing adds FT used ""business judgment in good faith"" to close the funds and that it should not be penalised for it.

111,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Cyber reinsurance rates rocket at July renewals - Willis Re,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global cyber reinsurance rates have soared by up to 40% in the July renewal season, reinsurance broker Willis Re said on Thursday, as ransomware attacks increase in number and severity.
A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May shut the largest fuel pipeline network in the United States for several days, crippling fuel delivery to most of the U.S. East Coast. 
The average ransom payment made by a business to restore data after a cyber attack was $220,000 in the first quarter, up 43% from the last quarter of 2020, according to cyber security firm Coveware.
In addition to the ransom payments, cyber insurance and reinsurance policies can cover the cost of restoring the network, business interruption losses and even the hiring of a PR agency to address reputational damage.
""Reinsurers that have been writing cyber are looking at considerably worse results than a few years ago,"" said James Vickers, chair of reinsurance broker Willis Re International.
""I don't think people had really imagined the extent of the ransomware attacks going on.""
Reinsurers insure the insurers, and a rise in reinsurance rates feeds through into higher insurance costs.
Businesses worldwide are fighting sophisticated data scientists as they battle to protect their data-rich computers from cyber crime - and the costly attacks are not going to stop, a top expert at insurer Sompo Holdings Inc told the Reuters Future of Insurance USA conference last week.
Insurers and reinsurers are cutting the amount of cyber coverage they provide after being hit with large claims, industry sources say.
Vickers said some countries such as France were debating whether cyber insurers should be making ransomware payments.
""Those discussions are beginning to happen,"" he said.

FBI Director Chris Wray last week pleaded with public companies and other hacking victims to avoid paying ransom, saying he feared it would only embolden cyber criminals to ramp up future attacks.
Property reinsurance rates have also risen by as much as 30% in Florida at July renewals, Willis Re said, as the hurricane season gets under way.

Shares of the company more than quadrupled in value in 2020 as it benefited from Britons working from home during the global health crisis. Investor focus is now on its expansion plans as AO World gears up for the new normal https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot.
In the year to March 31 its adjusted core profit rose to 64 million pounds ($88.4 million) from 22 million pounds a year before, it said, while confirming that group sales jumped 62%.
The British company, which sells laptops, washing machines, mobile phones and printers, said on Thursday it had started the new financial year ""well"", and remains ""prudently optimistic"" that it can deliver double-digit growth this year.
It said it hopes to more than double in size in the next five years and to operate in five countries, including its existing markets of Britain and Germany.
""We firmly believe that once people experience a better way to buy electricals, they are unlikely to return to old ways of shopping,"" said founder and Chief Executive John Roberts. 
With the pandemic forcing people cooped up at home to pursue home entertainment and gaming to keep themselves busy, demand for technology has soared. A shift to a mix of office and home work will also keep gadget demand steady, analysts have said.

The London-listed company intends to spend more on marketing to tap this demand, and has set aside 30 million pounds for use this year, with another 30 million pounds earmarked to upgrade its support systems, it said. 
Rival Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) also said its annual profit also jumped by a third and reported strong current trading on Wednesday.

116,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Known unknowns and unknown unknowns,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus.
The death of Donald Rumsfeld, the controversial architect of the Iraq war under President George W. Bush, brought back memories of heated news conferences and memorable quotes. 
Notably, his 2002 news briefing about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and his take about ""known knowns"", ""known unknowns"" and ""unknown unknowns"". 
Such phrases appear suddenly relevant to the two main worries of markets on the first day of the second half of 2021: COVID-19 and inflation.
We know inflation is picking up, we know we don't know if it will prove temporary and we know we don't know about unforeseeable events, such as a global crop disaster (given a record heat wave in Canada) or a financial black swan (hello Archegos!) that could quickly alter the monetary policy outlook.
With that in mind, it's not surprising that investors are in no rush to decide whether to dump the reflation trade for defensives and growth stocks before Friday's U.S. jobs report.
Economists polled by Reuters expect a gain of 690,000 jobs for June, up from 559,000 in May but the variation is large to say the least, from 400,000 to more than a million.
And with the 10-year Treasury yields steady at about 1.47%, the U.S. dollar hit a 15-month high against the yen and hovered near multi-month peaks against other major peers.
Turning back to COVID-19, we know the Delta variant spreads faster, we know we don't know how hard it will hit the world economy and there's no debate that this pandemic, prior to 2019, was the definition of an ""unknown unknown"".
Uncertainty on that front is high with countries from Indonesia to Australia and Britain to Russia all battling new outbreaks. In Europe, tightening restrictions for unvaccinated British tourists has hit travel and leisure stocks hard. 
European stock futures seem nevertheless upbeat prior ahead of the open, after the S&P 500 nabbed its fifth straight record closing high last night. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
- 181st Meeting of the OPEC Conference gets underway
- BOE Governor Bailey speech 
- Switzerland Inflation
- France, Germany PMI
- German retail sales recover in May
- Sweden rate decision
- Russian June factory activity shrinks

- Japan business mood at 2.5-year high

The Paris-based firm, one of the world's biggest catering companies alongside Britain's Compass, now expects an operating profit margin of 3.5% for the six months ended August 31, compared with 3.1% forecast earlier.
Revenue is now expected to rise around 15% on a like-for-like basis, the top end of its previous 10% to 15% outlook.
Like-for-like revenues for its third quarter jumped 19.0% to 4.48 billion euros ($5.30 billion), beating analysts' 12.1% estimates.
""Sodexo has now beaten expectations for four consecutive quarters, and its guidance provides a nice set-up for this to continue in the fourth quarter,"" said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Sodexo benefited from a rapid COVID-19 testing centre contract in Britain, as airline lounges began to open up in North America and children returned to schools across Europe.
Most schools were open in Europe during the spring - despite some class closures and a third lockdown in France - while in the United States, school districts are expected to resume in-person classes in the fall.
With university registrations taking place over July, Chief Executive Denis Machuel predicted that business for the start of the 2021 academic year would be very different from last year.
""Students want to return to campus, and our university clients want to see the students come back,"" he said.

 Compass Group  (LON:CPG) also predicted last month its food catering volumes would pick up from September as students return to campuses, audiences attend sports and music events and economic activity recovers.

Saudi Arabia granted Standard Chartered a banking licence in 2019, which helps it to expand beyond the capital markets business it has conducted in the kingdom since 2011. 
Standard Chartered was among other banks recently hired to lead energy giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s inaugural dollar sukuk issue that raised $6 billion.

Last year Standard Chartered appointed Yazaid al-Salloom as chief executive of its Saudi business.

(Reuters) - Insurance tech startup bolttech on Thursday said it raised $180 million in a funding round, led by private investment firm Activant Capital Group, that valued it at more than $1 billion. 
The New York and Singapore-based company's online platform serves as a matchmaker between insurance companies, allowing them to offer customers products that may not be in their area of specialization.
Insurance providers spend billions of dollars a year on advertising to bring in customers, some of whom may want financial products not in the providers portfolio, Rob Schimek, bolttech's group chief executive officer, pointed out.
The insurance providers ""just don't want to say no"" to these clients so they use bolttech to offer additional products, said Schimek, previously a top executive at insurance giant AIG (NYSE:AIG).
Bolttech has 150 insurance providers across 14 countries and $5 billion worth of insurance premium has been transacted through the platform, he said.
Bolttech also allows non-insurance companies to offer insurance products to customers and individuals and small businesses can buy insurance directly through the platform.

As part of its push, the company aims to reformulate products using low-calorie sweeteners, launch healthy snacks like its popcorn line PopWorks and take low-fat brands including the Lay's Oven Baked range to new markets. 
Soda makers have been under pressure to reduce added sugar in their drinks, especially in Europe where several countries have levied taxes on sweetened sodas, fruit juices and flavoured water to tackle health and obesity issues. 
""In Europe today, almost one in three beverages we sell is sugar-free and we believe this trend will continue to grow over time,"" said PepsiCo Europe's Chief Executive Officer Silviu Popovici. 
Europe accounted for nearly a fifth of PepsiCo's overall sales last year, making it the second-biggest revenue generating region after North America.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity broke records for a second consecutive quarter this year as companies continued to borrow cheaply and spend their cash reserves on transformative deals to reposition themselves for the post-COVID world.
Deals worth $1.5 trillion were announced in the three months to June 30, more than any second quarter on record and up 13% from the record first quarter of the year despite activity among blank-check firms slowed down, Refinitiv data shows.
""This is an environment we haven't seen before because we have very supportive financing markets combined with the pressure to come out of COVID-19 and reorganize entire businesses,"" said Alison Harding-Jones, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
""These high levels of activity will likely continue through the summer,"" she added.
Second quarter volumes rose 440% in the United States with $699 billion worth of M&A deals compared to the same quarter last year when the world's biggest economy came to a halt because of the pandemic.
President Joe Biden's proposed tax hikes drove some companies to rush to complete deals before proceeds get taxed at a higher rate. 
""Many transactions are happening because people want to announce and close before the end of the year. It makes sense on all sides from a tax perspective,"" said Anu Aiyengar, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
Dealmaking in Asia Pacific jumped 104% to $327 billion while Europe was up 50% to $293 billion.
The biggest deals of the quarter were all done domestically, as companies hedged their bets and refrained from hunting outside their home turf, wary of rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions between China and the United States.
""U.S. cross-border activity has decreased by just about every measure you can think about,"" said Vito Sperduto, co-head of global M&A at RBC Capital Markets.
The $40 billion merger of Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and food-delivery firm, Grab Holdings, with U.S. blank-check firm Altimeter was one of the few sizeable cross-border deals to top the quarterly charts.
SIZE MATTERS
While the global deal count suffered a 10% contraction compared to the first quarter, the M&A frenzy has translated into a spike in transactions value, with deals greater than $5 billion up 127% in the second quarter.
In the United States, telecoms firm AT&T (NYSE:T) merged its content unit WarnerMedia with rival Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) to create a media giant with an enterprise value of about $150 billion, while in Europe two German real estate giants - Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) - tied the knot in a $34.5 billion merger.
""Corporates have been reset by this crisis and their mantra is now simplification and digitalisation as they strive to become more focused and complement their business model with new technologies,"" said George Holst, head of the corporate clients group at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
The telecoms, media and technology (TMT) industry topped the M&A charts with a combination of deals, spin-offs and corporate reorganisations involving the likes of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and Dutch-listed technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV.
Fearful of falling prey to activist investors, companies across all sectors have taken steps to review their operations and tackle non-performing units.
""We expect a lot of sell-side activity in the second half of the year as many corporates are thinking about carve-outs right now. They feel it is the right time to refocus their businesses and divest non-core assets,"" said Tariq Hussain, head of European M&A at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
But for all its frenzy the second quarter saw a steep decline in SPAC listings as investors grew wary of the asset class and regulators tightened up scrutiny on blank-check companies. 
""SPACs are a massive accelerator of deals, but the types of SPACs that will succeed going forward are more institutional in nature. Investors are no longer buying into these vehicles indiscriminately unless they have a solid story and management team,"" said Dominic Lester, European head of investment banking at Jefferies.
FAST AND FURIOUS
The decline in SPAC activity was largely offset by a flurry of private equity-backed buyouts which rose 152% in the first six months of the year to $512 billion, representing 18% of global M&A volumes.
""What we're seeing now is cheapness of capital. The cost of capital is obviously playing a role in the activity that we are watching for both strategic and sponsor acquirers,"" said Lyle Wilpon, head of global M&A at BMO Capital Markets.
In Britain – Europe's biggest M&A market – the bout of private equity assaults was fast and furious with several publicly traded companies such as asset management services provider Sanne receiving multiple proposals before agreeing to a takeover deal.
Dealmakers said a possible hike in interest rates in the second half of the year could make financing conditions less favourable for investment funds but the pressure to deploy capital would remain intact for the next few quarters.
""Dry powder held by sophisticated private equity firms is at record highs which provides for meaningful buyer interest in target companies,"" said Steven Geller, co-head of global M&A at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

Yet, the current level of activity might not be sustainable for long.
""Can you really grow off of such a high number of deals? It's more than likely that we are going to stabilise down a little bit because companies have to digest what they've done so far,"" said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, global co-head of M&A at UBS.

The company also said it expects pro forma net revenue for the quarter ended June 30 to be between $917 million and $920 million, and pro forma adjusted EBITDA estimated between $270 million and $275 million.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Warburg Pincus is stepping up investment in China's urban renewal and redevelopment sector, announcing on Wednesday the setup of a new platform that acquires under-utilised properties in Shanghai and Beijing and converts them into serviced apartments, creative offices, or mixed-use commercial projects.
Golden Union Assets, jointly formed by the U.S. private equity giant and China's Golden Union Group, currently holds and manages 19 acquired properties worth 15 billion yuan ($2.32 billion), and expects assets under management to more than triple to 50 billion yuan in three years.
""This investment demonstrates our belief in the tremendous growth opportunity in urban renewal and redevelopment,"" Qiqi Zhang, managing director of Warburg Pincus, said at a ceremony in Shanghai.
Warburg Pincus will leverage its global resources and local expertise to ""turbocharge"" the company's growth, he said.
In real estate investing, urban renewal is the latest focus for Warburg Pincus, which has already invested in nearly 40 billion yuan worth of redevelopment projects in the country.
Warburg Pincus, whose president is former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, previously made big bets in China's logistics properties and data centres.
China has imposed curbs on the property sector, but has been encouraging investment in urban redevelopment and rental properties.
The establishment of Warburg Pincus' new urban renewal platform also comes as China recently launched a public real estate investment trusts (REITs) market for infrastructure projects. A possible expansion of that market will potentially create an exit route for commercial property investors.
Zhang said that through the new platform, Warburg Pincus seeks to capitalize on Golden Union's decade-long experience in urban renewal.
Jessica Yu, chairman of Golden Union, said the alliance with Warburg Pincus gives easier access to long-term capital.

""What is the biggest challenge in holding urban renewal projects? You need long-term, and cheap money,"" she said at the ceremony. ""That's why we join hands with Warburg Pincus.""

West, who will take charge on Aug. 27, spent 16 years at GE, where he served as CFO of its aviation and engine services businesses.
His appointment comes as Boeing (NYSE:BA) faces one of the most turbulent periods in its history, marked by a safety crisis followed by rising debt during the pandemic.
""I have had the pleasure of working with Brian previously, and he is an exceptional leader,"" Boeing Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun said in a statement.
West and Calhoun had worked together at GE earlier. West was with the conglomerate from 1990 to 2007, while Calhoun left it in 2006 after 26 years. West then joined Nielsen, which was then headed by Calhoun.
Boeing has named senior vice president Dave Dohnalek as interim financial chief until West takes over.

West has been the CFO of financial market data provider Refinitiv since 2018.
Separately, the planemaker said the board planned to increase the number of directors to 11 from 10.

(Reuters) -Chevron Corp is looking to sell two collections of conventional oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin valued at more than $1 billion combined, three sources told Reuters. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) confirmed that it is marketing conventional assets in the Permian Basin, but did not specify the value of the assets. 
U.S. oil futures (CLc1) have soared more than 50% so far this year, prompting companies to try to sell assets in Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the country's largest oil field.
Chevron is looking to sell lower-value assets, while some majors, like Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) are considering exiting the formation entirely. 
Shell is looking to exit the Permian to invest in energy transition, while Chevron's focus is investing in its highest performing assets.
Chevron has retained an investment bank to market some Permian oil and gas fields valued at $879 million and has additional assets of more than $200 million available for sale elsewhere in the basin, the sources said. 
Chevron shares closed about 1% higher on the day at $104.74, moving late in the session after Reuters reported the planned divestures. 
""The big picture is that Chevron has one of the largest and most advantaged positions in the Permian and is able to test the capital discipline of the industry with what it would consider marginal assets that are a much smaller package than the Shell potential offering,"" said Paul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research in New York. 
Initial bid proposals were due by June 10, with a planned July 1 sale date for the larger package. The assets are operated by Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) and span 57,000 net acres (231 square kilometers) with production of about 10,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
""We can confirm that Chevron is marketing conventional assets in the Permian Basin,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""As our senior executives have said, Chevron has an ongoing program to evaluate and prioritize its assets to ensure that they align with the company’s long-term business strategies.""
Together, the assets Chevron is marketing could fetch as much as $1.2 billion, based upon the strength of oil futures, according to one of the people.
The larger package of assets is well positioned for long-term implementation of carbon capture and sequestration, according to the people. The technology is one that some fossil fuel companies are using to reduce or offset carbon emissions. 

Chevron has been evaluating other assets in the Permian and elsewhere, one of the people said, and could divest older assets over the year as it looks to boost investments in energy transition.
Chevron has previously said it is fine-tuning its oil holdings.

(Reuters) -Shares of security software provider SentinelOne Inc jumped 21.4% in their U.S. stock market debut on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalization of nearly $11 billion. 
Its shares opened at $46 and finished the day at $42.5, above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $35, indicating investors' interest in fast-growing software companies in a week flooded with IPOs.
SentinelOne sold 35 million shares to raise about $1.23 billion in the IPO. It had earlier planned to sell 32 million shares priced between $31 and $32 per share. 
""We're reaching a certain scale in our business, and we desire to be a trusted and transparent vendor as a public company,"" SentinelOne Chief Executive Tomer Weingarten (NYSE:WRI) said in an interview. 
Mountain View, California-based SentinelOne protects laptops and mobile phones from security breaches by using artificial intelligence technology to identify unusual behavior in enterprise networks. It competes with Crowdstrike and its customers include JetBlue,  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), and the U.S. government.
The pandemic has boosted demand for cybersecurity software as organizations worldwide move to a remote work model.
The company plans to expand beyond endpoint protections and build more product lines, including data analytics, as well as pursue acquisitions. 
Backed by Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), SentinelOne was last valued at $3 billion in a funding round in November. 
""They started with medium enterprises, and then expanded to big companies as well as the government. Once they got interest from the public sector, it's the biggest stamp of approval for cybersecurity,"" said Yanev Suissa, founder of SineWave Ventures, an early investor.

Listed on the same day as Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc, SentinelOne went public in one of the busiest weeks of 2021 for U.S. IPOs. At least 17 companies will enter the market this week.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were the lead underwriters for SentinelOne's offering.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 nabbed its fifth straight record closing high on Wednesday as investors ended the month and the quarter by largely shrugging off positive economic data and looking toward Friday's highly anticipated employment report.
In the last session of 2021's first half, the indexes were languid and range-bound, with the blue-chip Dow posting gains, while the Nasdaq edged lower.
All three indexes posted their fifth consecutive quarterly gains, with the S&P rising 8.2%, the Nasdaq advancing 9.5% and the Dow rising 4.6%. The S&P 500 registered its second-best first-half performance since 1998, rising 14.5%.
""It's been a good quarter,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""As of last night’s close, the S&P has gained more than 14% year-to-date, topping the Dow and the Nasdaq. That indicates that the stock market is having a broad rally.""
For the month, the bellwether S&P 500 notched its fifth consecutive advance, while the Dow snapped its four-month winning streak to end slightly lower. The Nasdaq also gained ground in June.
This month, investor appetite shifted away from economically sensitive cyclicals in favor of growth stocks.
""Leading sectors year-to-date are what you'd expect,"" Pavlik added. ""Energy, financials and industrials, and that speaks to an economic environment that's in the early stages of a cycle.""
""(Investors) started the switch back to growth (stocks) after people started to buy in to (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell's comments that focus on transitory inflation,"" Pavlik added.
""Some of the reopening trades have gotten a bit long in the tooth and that's leading people back to growth.""
(Graphic: Growths stocks outperform value in June, narrow YTD gap, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmdkqdvr/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(4).png) 
""The overall stock market continues to be on a tear, with very consistent gains for quite some time,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Valuations, while certainly high by historical standards, have been at a fairly consistent level, benefiting from the economic recovery.""
The private sector added 692,000 jobs in June, breezing past expectations, according to payroll processor ADP. The number is 92,000 higher than the private payroll adds economists predict from the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report due on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 210.22 points, or 0.61%, to 34,502.51, the S&P 500 gained 5.7 points, or 0.13%, to 4,297.5 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.38 points, or 0.17%, to 14,503.95.
Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P, six ended the session higher, with energy enjoying the biggest percentage gain. Real estate was the day's biggest loser.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gained 1.6% after Germany's defense ministry announced it would buy five of the planemaker's P-8A maritime control aircraft, coming on the heels of United Airlines unveiling its largest-ever order for new planes. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) jumped 2.7% after announcing on Tuesday that it would start selling a prescription-only insulin analog.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) advanced 2.5% ahead of its quarterly earnings release, but was relatively unchanged in after-hours trading following the chipmaker's quarterly results.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 36 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.85 billion shares, compared with the 11.05 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Micron Technology Inc on Wednesday beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and forecast fourth-quarter revenue above expectations, as tight supplies of memory chips and continued strong demand kept prices high. 
The chipmaker forecast current-quarter revenue of $8.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million, while analysts on average were expecting $7.87 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) makes NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market and DRAM memory chips that are used in data centers, smartphones and other computing devices. It has benefited from the pandemic-induced global shift toward remote work as demand for laptops and other electronic devices soared.
In prepared remarks, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said the company expects industry-wide supplies of both kinds of chips to remain tight until the end of next year, keeping prices high.
""We believe Micron’s strong financial performance will continue cross-cycle, and over the long term, our revenue growth will outperform the broader semiconductor industry,"" Mehrotra said.
Shares rose 0.6% in after-hours trading.
The company's revenue for the third quarter ended June 3 rose 36% to $7.42 billion, beating estimates of $7.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.88 per share in the quarter, above estimates of $1.72.
The company also said it will sell a plant in Lehi, Utah, to Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc. Micron said it expects to get about $1.5 billion for the plant, $900 million of which will be in cash and $600 million of which will be in the value of tools it can either sell to outsiders or move to its other factories. Micron had said it would sell the Utah facility, which it shared with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), under a joint venture formed nearly a decade ago, as part of a broader technology strategy shift https://www.reuters.com/article/us-micron-tech-strategy/micron-to-put-utah-chip-factory-up-for-sale-as-it-shifts-strategy-idUSKBN2B82WO.
The company took an impairment charge of $435 million because the $900 million in cash was below the book value of the factory, but Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana told Reuters in an interview that the factory was on track to generate almost $500 million in losses this year because it was underutilized. 
Micron also said that its capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 would rise above $9.5 billion, partly driven by pre-payments as it starts to acquire extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines from Dutch maker ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV. The machines are necessary for making the most cutting-edge chips but can cost more than $100 million each.

The company stretched out its use of cheaper chipmaker techniques as long as it could but will start using the EUV machines in production in 2024, officials said.
""EUV is a very big and important tool in the manufacturing line. And EUV itself is a tool that has a long lead time for manufacturing from ASML. The orders have to be placed just about now,"" Sadana said.

(Reuters) -Didi Global Inc shares ended their first day of U.S. trading slightly over their initial public offering (IPO) price, valuing the ride-hailing giant at $68.49 billion in the biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese company since 2014.
The stock market debut vindicated Didi's decision to moderate its valuation expectations, after investors raised concerns over the pace and profitability of its expansion in new services and foreign markets. Reuters reported in March that Didi was hoping the IPO could value it at as much as $100 billion.
SoftBank-backed Didi's stock opened at $16.65, significantly higher than its $14 IPO price. The shares slid in the early afternoon after reaching an $18 high. 
Didi had priced an upsized offering of 316.8 million American depositary shares at the upper end of its $13 to $14 range, raising $4.4 billion.
Didi is the latest in a string of Chinese companies seeking to capitalize on the frothy valuations of the U.S. stock market. About 29 Chinese firms raised $7.6 billion in U.S. IPOs in the first six months of the year, according to Refinitiv data. This is despite the ongoing economic tensions between the United States and China, as well as U.S. concerns over the quality of the auditing of Chinese companies' financial statements.
Didi is also under investigation by Chinese authorities over potential antitrust violations, Reuters reported earlier this month. 
""All of the major Chinese internet companies are under much more scrutiny now than they've been in the past. It's just a risk for the sector,"" said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Didi, which is also backed by technology investment giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent and Uber (NYSE:UBER), was founded in 2012 by Cheng Wei as Didi Dache, a taxi-hailing app. It merged with peer Kuaidi Dache to become Didi Kuaidi and was later renamed Didi Chuxing.
Chief Executive Cheng, who was born in 1983 in a small town in the southeastern province of Jiangxi and once worked as an assistant to the head of a foot massage firm, was worth $1.2 billion prior to Didi's market debut, according to Forbes. 
Cheng got the idea for a ride-hailing platform on a freezing winter night in Beijing when he had trouble getting a taxi. 
SoftBank is Didi's largest investor with a 20.2% stake. Tencent holds 6.4%, while Uber retains 12% of Didi. Cheng will own a 6.5% stake in the company he built, while having a 35.5% voting power due to a dual-class share structure that's become increasingly popular among tech companies. 
Based on Wednesday's closing price, Cheng's stake in Didi is worth $4.45 billion. Uber's stake in Didi is valued at $8 billion, significantly more than the $6 billion valuation that Uber assigned to it in 2016, when it received the stake in exchange for selling its China food delivery business to Didi, according to a regulatory filing from Uber.
Like most ride-hailing companies, Didi had historically been unprofitable, until it reported a profit of $30 million in the first quarter of this year.
The company reported a loss of $1.6 billion last year and an 8% drop in revenue to $21.63 billion, according to a regulatory filing, as business slid during the pandemic.
Didi decided in 2018 to invest $1 billion in its auto services business, part of a larger unit rebranding. It has also invested heavily to expand its core business outside its home market by either pouring money in local partners or launching their services. 
Didi has a dominant position in the online ride-hailing business in China and operates in 4,000 locations across 16 countries. It has more than 490 million annual active users, according to a recent regulatory filing.

Its offerings include private car-hailing, sharing bikes, delivery, freight and logistics, and financial services. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) (Asia) L.L.C.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>","Robinhood fined $70 million for harming 'millions' via misleading info, outages","By Chris Prentice and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's industry regulator fined Robinhood Financial LLC $70 million on Wednesday for ""systemic"" failures, including systems outages, providing ""false or misleading"" information, and weak options trading controls, saying those factors combined harmed millions of the app's customers.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fine is the latest hit to Robinhood's reputation. The broker, which has been credited with democratizing trading, is under scrutiny by federal and state policymakers following this year's meme-stock fiasco which raised questions over the California firm's business model, risk management and customer treatment.
However, the sweeping agreement, which resolves alleged FINRA violations dating back to September 2016, likely paves the way for the firm to move forward quickly with a planned initial public offering that has been delayed due to meme-stock backlash and other regulatory queries. 
Robinhood's resolution with FINRA includes $12.6 million in restitution to thousands of customers and a $57 million penalty, the largest in the regulator's history, and covers a range of issues dating back to September 2016, FINRA said in a statement. 
""The fine... reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood's violations, including FINRA's finding that Robinhood communicated false and misleading information to millions of its customers,"" said Jessica Hopper, Head of Enforcement at FINRA.
According to FINRA, those communications related to whether customers could place trades on margin, how much cash was in their accounts, how much buying power they had, the risk of loss customers faced in certain transactions, and whether customers faced margin calls.
FINRA noted that a Robinhood customer took his life in 2020 after becoming confused by messages in his account which appeared to show he had turned off margin trades and inaccurately showed a negative cash balance. Thousands of other customers suffered more than $7 million in losses due to similar mis-statements, FINRA alleged. 
Between 2018 and late 2020 Robinhood also failed to properly supervise its technology, causing it to experience a ""series of outages and critical systems failures,"" including a major outage during the pandemic turmoil of March 2020, which led customers to lose money, FINRA said. 
During the same period, Robinhood also failed to properly vet customers before allowing them to make risky options bets, FINRA alleged.
Robinhood neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to FINRA's findings. The company said in a statement that it was overhauling its business, installing new supervisory and communications procedures, and has hired a slew of attorneys, including previous regulators. 
""There’s a clear message: You can try to democratize investing and demystify finance, but you can’t cut corners,"" said Robert Frenchman, an attorney with Mukasey Frenchman & Sklaroff, who added the settlement should be good news for the IPO. 
""It’s good because it clears up such a wide range of issues that now they can say they have settled with regulators. I can see the value – it’s a lot of money – in settling on such a salad of FINRA violations.""
FINRA, a self-regulatory body which reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in 2019 fined Robinhood $1.25 million for order execution failures. 
The SEC has also taken aim at Robinhood, last year fining the company $65 million to settle charges it misled customers about its revenue sources.

Still, Robinhood's legal and regulatory woes are unlikely to be over. The SEC is also mulling new rules to rein in ""gamification,"" game-like features that encourage trading, and payment-for-order flow, whereby brokers send retail customer orders to wholesale brokers in return for a fee - practices both deployed by Robinhood. 
Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin, who is also pursuing a case against the company, said he was ""delighted"" FINRA had pursued Robinhood's misconduct, but questioned whether the $12.6 million customer restitution was sufficient.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 05:18PM ET</span>",Global shares fall on pandemic fears ahead of U.S. jobs report,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global shares retreated from recent highs on Wednesday, as Asian markets grew jittery about a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and Western markets awaited Friday's U.S. jobs report and what it might mean for monetary policy.
Asset markets have been buoyed over the past year by trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus from global central banks responding to the pandemic. 
Successful vaccination rollouts have fueled economic recoveries in some places, with consumer confidence in June surging in Europe and the United States.
But fears over a sudden rise in inflation and the highly contagious Delta variant combined with investors taking gains as the first half of the year ended on Wednesday. 
The dollar was headed for its biggest monthly rise since November 2016, as investors turned to the safe-haven currency betting that a good Friday jobs report will strengthen the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt.
""We believe markets are reassessing the U.S. outlook as key data this week are expected to show a strong economy as we move into (the second half),"" wrote analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
""This stands in contrast to many other parts of the world, where lagging vaccine rollouts are allowing the Delta variant to quickly spread, forcing some to go back into lockdown."" 
MSCI's all-country world index, which tracks shares across 50 countries, fell 0.23%. It was still set for a fifth straight month of gains, and for a rise of more than 11% in the first half.
The S&P 500 nabbed its fifth straight record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 210.22 points, or 0.61%, the S&P 500 gained 5.7 points, or 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.38 points, or 0.17%. (N)
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.77%. The German DAX fell 159.55, or 1.02%, and London's FTSE 100 fell 50.08, or 0.71%.
EYES ON PAYROLLS 
Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. private payrolls increased 692,000 jobs in June, more than expected but less than the 886,000 jobs added in May.
Markets stayed focused on the more comprehensive U.S. nonfarm payrolls figures due out Friday. Economists polled by Reuters were expect a gain of 690,000 jobs for June, up from 559,000 in May. But the variation among the 63 estimates was large, ranging from 400,000 to more than a million. 
The benchmark 10-year yield rose to yield 1.4426%, from 1.48% 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.3 points or 0.33%, to 92.349.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Wednesday he would like the Fed to start reducing its support for the economy before the end of the year.
""With inflation still running hot and the labor market recovery shifting into a lower gear, policymakers at the Federal Reserve are no doubt starting to get antsy,"" said Matthew Weller, global head of market research at FOREX.com and City Index.
The euro was down 0.37% to $1.1851, while Britain's pound was last trading at $1.3807, down 0.20% on the day. 
The Japanese yen weakened 0.45% versus the greenback to 111.03 per dollar.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.12% lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.07%. Chinese blue chips added 0.65%. 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia are all battling outbreaks of COVID-19 and tightening restrictions, and Spain and Portugal announced restrictions for unvaccinated British tourists.
Oil prices rose on Wednesday, heading for monthly and quarterly gains, after U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a sixth straight week and an OPEC report foresaw an undersupplied market this year. [O/R]

The Brent crude contract for August, which expired on Wednesday, ended the session up 37 cents, or 0.5% at $75.13 a barrel. The September contract rose 34 cents to settle at $74.62 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled up 49 cents, or 0.7%, at $73.47 a barrel.
Gold headed for its largest monthly decline since November 2016. Spot gold added 0.2% to $1,765.16 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.13% to $1,765.10 an ounce. [GOL/]

American plants for few weeks on chip shortage,"(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Wednesday several of its North American factories will be shut for a few weeks in July and August due to a global shortage of semiconductors.
The supply crunch would cost it $2.5 billion this year and halve vehicle production in the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had said in April.
""While we continue to manufacture new vehicles, we're prioritizing completing our customers' vehicles that were assembled without certain parts due to the industry-wide semiconductor shortage,"" Ford said in a statement.
The No.2 U.S. automaker said its Chicago assembly plant, which makes the Explorer sport utility vehicles (SUVs), will be shut from the week of July 5 to the week of July 26. The plant will run two shifts during the Aug. 2 week.
The company said it would also shutter the production line for one of its best selling vehicles, the F-150 pickup truck, at its Kansas City assembly plant for a couple of weeks next month. 

Ford's Michigan assembly plant that recently started shipping its Bronco SUVs will be down for two weeks in July due to a shortage of certain auto parts, the company said, adding that this was unrelated to the chip shortage.
Shares of Ford were down nearly 1% in afternoon trading.

Despite huge industry competition, recent developments made by Merck (MRK) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) are likely to boost their growth substantially. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) offers health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and consumer care products. The company operates through two segments—Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. Its products are marketed directly and through its joint ventures to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers.
Sanofi (SNY) is a healthcare company based in France that researches, develops, manufactures, and markets therapeutic solutions internationally. The company operates through three segments—Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare. It also develops cardiovascular, thrombosis, metabolic disorder, central nervous system, and oncology medicines and drugs.
Because COVID-19 is almost under control in several countries, the pharmaceutical industry, which garnered significant attention because of its role in fighting the virus, may have little additional upside to offer investors based on COVID-19 related products and solutions. However, the continuing efforts of pharma companies in finding cures for other critical diseases should keep driving the industry’s growth. Consequently, the global pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow at an 8% CAGR to hit $1.70 trillion by 2025.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at a record again Wednesday, wrapping up a positive end to the first half of the year following a stronger private jobs report, with investors touting further market gains for remainder of the year.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.20% to a record intraday level of 4,297.32 , and is up more than 15% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.61%, or 210 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.17%.
Private payrolls increased 692,000, beating the consensus estimate of 600,000, as the reopening of the economy drove up job gains in leisure and hospitality.
“The services jobs was very strong in the ADP report, which is consistent with the reopening in the U.S.,” John Ragard, senior portfolio manager, small cap equity at Spouting Rock Asset Management told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""Airlines are hiring more pilots, hotel occupancy and hotel rates are increasing […] there's clearly a need for more people to come back into the services sector, especially into the travel and transportation industry.”
The bullish ADP numbers, while not completely correlated with the monthly payrolls report, do bode well for Friday’s jobs report, which will garner added attention following softer reports in April and May. Economists forecast the U.S. economy created about 600,000 jobs in June.
Cyclical stocks, which move in tandem with the economy, were higher, led by energy as oil prices rose ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. Investors are betting that energy demand will outstrip supply ahead of a busy period of travel over the summer months.
“It is emerging that the unexpectedly robust recovery of demand will see a shortfall of up to 2 million barrels per day on the market in the second half of the year,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Financials continued to add to recent gains, with major Wall Street banks trending higher.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rose more than 1%.
Tech, meanwhile, took a breather from its recent melt-up even as bond yields remained sluggish amid expectations that inflation and growth may have peaked.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were mostly lower.
“The bond markets are telling us that growth is decelerating [amid] some recent inflation data points that have been relatively soft."" Ragard said. ""I'm not saying that we won't still see some surprising inflation numbers, month to month [...] but I do believe that the growth rates have peaked.""
Still, the overall market will continue to grind higher in the second half of the year with greater corporate productivity expected to push earnings higher.
""I think the market will continue to gradually drift higher, driven by the relative strength of company's earnings and cash flows,"" Ragard said. The pandemic impact and the labor shortage has forced companies to spend money on technology including automation, driving up the productivity gains, which ultimately will boost margins and earnings growth.   
""Companies are finding ways to make capital decisions mostly with technology to get good rates of return on their investment and faster paybacks,"" Ragard added. ""This is enhancing their profit margins and will help to offset some of the headwinds with inflation and the [expected] deceleration of economic growth,"" Ragard added."

Investing.com -- Stocks marked a strong first half to the year, fueled by economically sensitive stocks and a flurry of initial public offerings driving investor enthusiasm.
Wednesday’s ADP payroll report showed employers added 692,000 jobs in June. The bullish report bodes well for Friday’s jobs report from the government. Economists forecast the U.S. economy created about 600,000 jobs in June.
Cyclical stocks, which move in tandem with the economy, were higher, led by energy stocks. Oil prices are rising ahead of Thursday’s meeting of OPEC and an inventory report for last week that showed crude stocks continued to decline.
The S&P 500 has notched steady gains throughout the first half of this year -- and closed at another record high on Wednesday -- despite rising fear about inflation as the economy reopens and concerns the Federal Reserve might have to slam the brakes.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Chip results
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)reports after tonight’s closing bell. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expected it to report earnings per share of $1.70 for the third quarter on revenue of $7.2 billion. The shares rose earlier after BMO upgraded the stock to outperform on the expectation that the current situation of demand exceeding supply could last longer and will benefit the memory chipmaker.
2. Didi jumps in debut
Shares of the ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc ADR (NYSE:DIDI) debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday at $16.65, almost 19% higher than their issue price of $14. The company’s market cap was hovering around $77 billion on the first day. Rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) has a market cap of $95 billion. But in late trading Didi had given up most of its initial pop, and it closed its first day of trading up just 1%.
3. More data on employment
First-time filings for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 26 are seen falling to 390,000 from 411,000 in the previous period. The Labor Department will release jobless claims numbers Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Continuing claims are seen falling to 3.382 million from 3.39 million. That number runs a week behind the headline claims total.

(Reuters) - Smithfield Foods Inc said on Wednesday it will pay $83 million to settle litigation that accused several companies of conspiring to limit supply in the $20 billion-a-year U.S. pork market to inflate prices and their own profits.
The settlement with Smithfield resolves antitrust claims by ""direct"" purchasers such as Maplevale Farms that accused the nation's largest pork companies of having fixed prices beginning in 2009.
Smithfield's settlement requires approval by Chief Judge John Tunheim of the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis.
Keira Lombardo, Smithfield's chief administrative officer, said the settlement eliminates a ""substantial portion"" of the Smithfield, Virginia-based company's exposure in the litigation.
She also said Smithfield denied liability in agreeing to settle, and believed its conduct was always lawful.
Smithfield's parent WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd says it is the world's largest pork producer.
Clifford Pearson, a lawyer for the direct purchasers, declined to comment.
 Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL), the JBS USA unit of Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY),  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and data provider Agri Stats Inc are among the other defendants in the litigation.
Smithfield and those companies are also defendants in related price-fixing litigation in Minneapolis by commercial and other ""indirect"" pork purchasers, such as restaurants and delis.

The litigation is similar to litigation in federal court in Chicago where purchasers accused companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc and JBS' majority-owned Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp of conspiring to fix broiler chicken prices.
The case is In re Pork Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-01776.

For work, education, entertainment, and shopping, people had to resort to communication services. While the economic recovery this year has been helping people to return to their pre-pandemic “analog” lifestyles, the demand for communication services, along with the continuation of some pandemic-driven trends, is not expected to decline anytime soon. Investors’ interest in the communication service space is partly evident in the SPDR S&P Telecom ETF’s (XTL) 51.6% gains over the past nine months.
Rising demand for better connectivity should keep driving the industry’s growth. According to Rich Communication Services (RCS), the market’s size is projected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2020 to $11.7 billion by 2025, representing a 17.6% CAGR.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG is considering centralising the management of its bankers to the world's wealthy, reversing a regional structure put in place six years ago, as the scandal-plagued Swiss bank looks for ways to tighten controls and improve operations, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The bank’s wealth management business is split, residing in three separate divisions -- the international business, Swiss business and a separate Asia-Pacific unit. Some executives felt that separation had not worked well and combining the businesses into one group would offer benefits, one of the sources said.
By doing so, Credit Suisse would reel in local managers in Asia and internationally, who have enjoyed considerable autonomy, putting them under tighter Swiss control as well as making it easier to cut costs, the sources said. 
It would be able to streamline products, while also becoming more attractive to a potential merger partner, one of the sources said. A global entity could work better with the investment bank, two of the sources said.
Credit Suisse declined to comment.
The discussions within Credit Suisse, which have not been previously reported, come after the bank suffered scandals including its ties to collapsed supply chain finance company Greensill Capital and losses from family office Archegos, exposing weaknesses in its risk controls. 
The crises hammered the bank's share price, and sources previously said left some executives worried that the bank could be vulnerable to unwanted pressure from activist investors or hostile suitors to change strategy. 
Antonio Horta-Osorio, the bank’s new chairman, kicked off a strategic review in May. Options under discussion include spinning off its local Swiss bank to prepare the rest of the business for a merger, pruning back investment banking or selling its asset management business, sources have said. 
FRESH STRATEGY
The Swiss bank and its board are looking to decide on a fresh strategy as soon as October after an annual strategy meeting in the mountain town of Bad Ragaz, best known for its spas and thermal baths, two sources familiar with the thinking of senior executives said.
Re-imagining the wealth division, seen by analysts and investors as the most prized part of Credit Suisse, illustrates how deep this overhaul is likely to be.
A merged wealth management unit could either combine the Asia-Pacific and International Wealth Management divisions, or further fold in the bank's private banking business for ultra-wealthy customers in its home market, which now sits in its Swiss division, one of the sources said.
A combined unit may get new leadership, the sources said, adding that Horta-Osorio was driving key decisions.
The model would follow a strategy taken by UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) , which adopted a unified global wealth management structure by combining its businesses servicing American and international clients into one global division in 2018, allowing it to trim costs. 

One of the options that Credit Suisse executives have discussed in the past is a merger with UBS, sources have previously said. 
In Bad Ragaz, executives did not formally discuss mergers, but the possibility of a tie-up was ""the elephant in the room"", one source said after the meeting.

The company has demonstrated its supercomputing success with increasing market share and an endorsement by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). These two events suggest break-out potential in AMD’s data center segment, Arya said. 
The analyst maintained a buy rating on the stock. 
Even if there are supply constraints, the improving mix towards data centers could provide catch-up potential, Arya wrote in a note.

ROME (Reuters) -Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Wednesday halted a refund scheme aimed at promoting digital payments, and partially lifted a ban on firing which was introduced last year at the height of the Italy's COVID-19 pandemic.
The previous government led by Giuseppe Conte launched the refund scheme in 2020, allowing Italians to claim back 10% of all their credit or debit card spending up to a ceiling of 3,000 euros ($3,554.70).
The project, planned to last until June 2022, was aimed at reducing widespread tax evasion in the traditionally cash-based economy.
However, the cabinet decided to suspend the scheme from July 1 until the end of this year, Draghi's office said in a statement, confirming a draft of the decree previously reported by Reuters.
Draghi told ministers the measure was badly designed because it favoured richer households with less propensity to spend, his office said.
The so-called ""cashless economy"" plan was estimated by the Treasury to cost almost 5 billion euros over this year and next.
A senior lawmaker in the ruling coalition said on condition of anonymity that Rome needed to make savings to fund other measures in the pipeline, such as a reform of jobless benefits, for which the draft seen by Reuters earmarked 1.5 billion euros.
The suspension of the refund scheme, first mooted on Monday after a meeting between Draghi and key coalition figures, has hit shares in Italian payments group Nexi (MI:NEXII), which were slightly lower on Wednesday after falling 1.2% on Tuesday.
It has also triggered criticism within the ruling, multi-party coalition, especially from the 5-Star Movement. 
Separately, the government decided not to extend a ban on firing beyond the current end-June deadline except for workers in sectors hardest-hit by COVID-19 lockdowns.
For workers in textiles, shoemaking and fashion, the ban will continue through October. Companies in those sectors can access a further 17 weeks of a pandemic-related furlough scheme.
Another 13-week temporary lay-off scheme will be made available to help manufacturing and construction companies.

The government also earmarked 1 billion euros to try to cushion the impact of costlier raw materials on electricity bills.

(Reuters) -Volvo Cars is ""making good progress"" toward a potential initial public offering by the end of this year, the chief executive of the Swedish premium auto brand told Reuters on Wednesday.
""We are looking at the possibility of doing an IPO before the end of the year,"" listing shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in an interview. 
Samuelsson and other Volvo Cars executives on Wednesday laid out an extensive road map to becoming a fully electric car maker by 2030, including plans to sell 600,000 battery electric vehicles at mid-decade and build a European battery gigafactory in 2026.
Volvo Cars earlier this year scrapped a proposed merger with the company's Chinese parent, Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile. In March, Geely said Volvo Cars would explore capital market options, including an initial public offering and stock market listing.
A flock of startups has gone public in the United States and China over the past two years, following electric vehicle market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in taking advantage of investor enthusiasm to raise cheap capital to compete with established brands such as Volvo.
Samuelsson said Volvo Cars and Geely will continue to share vehicle architectures, internal combustion powertrains and other components. But the companies will do so at ""an arm's length distance,"" consistent with the way independent companies do business, he said.During Wednesday's briefing, Volvo Cars also said it plans to equip many of its future vehicles with self-driving technology, including standard lidar sensors from Luminar Technologies Inc and computers from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.
""Our goal is to build the safest cars possible, using all available technology,"" Samuelsson said.
As it launches new electric vehicles, Volvo Cars also plans a slew of related products, including insurance and vehicle subscription payment plans offered directly by the automaker, Samuelsson said.
""The whole vehicle business will be recurring revenue,"" Samuelsson said.
In Europe, the company plans to change its retail operations so that customers order new electric vehicles directly from the manufacturer, with dealers paid commissions to deliver them, Samuelsson said. In the United States, where laws protect existing dealers, Volvo will still sell vehicles through franchised retailers.
For its future electric vehicles, Volvo Cars is working with Swedish partner Northvolt on a new generation of batteries with higher energy and designed to be packaged as a structural element of the vehicle.
The new batteries, due after 2025, will enable a longer driving range between charges - up to 625 miles (1,006 km) - and much faster charging times.

Volvo Cars and Northvolt are planning to build a European battery plant in 2026 with 50 gWh production capacity - enough to supply 500,000 vehicles or more, depending on battery size. In comparison, Tesla Inc's Nevada gigafactory has 35 gWh capacity.
Samuelsson said Volvo Cars next year will unveil the first of its new-generation electric vehicles, a flagship SUV that will share its platform with additional models to follow.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said in its filing that it was requesting Khan's recusal from all matters related to Amazon because of her previous work while at an antitrust advocacy group, public statements and work for a congressional subcommittee.
""Given her long track record of detailed pronouncements about Amazon, and her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws, a reasonable observer would conclude that she no longer can consider the company's antitrust defenses with an open mind,"" Amazon said in its filing. ""Indeed, doing so would require her to repudiate the years of writings and statements that are at the foundation of her professional career."" 
The FTC declined comment.
The agency is investigating Amazon as part of a series of probes underway into Big Tech. It is also probing Amazon's planned purchase of the U.S. movie studio MGM.

Khan wrote a piece for the Yale Law Journal in 2017 which argues that current antitrust law, which focuses on prices and the short term, fail to capture harms done by companies like Amazon, including predatory pricing.
She also worked for the House Judiciary antitrust committee, which wrote a massive report that spelled out what it said was anti-competitive conduct by Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has signaled two interest rate hikes as soon as late 2023, which is a year earlier than anticipated, which should be a boon to the financial sector.

Investing.com -- It's early days, but with electric vehicle production and demand set to boom, we're going to need a lot of lithium. And recycling it has become a U.S. priority.
That's good news for lithium-ion battery recycler Li-Cycle, which is going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company in the coming weeks.
While the recycling pickings are relatively light for now -- including scrap manufacturing and cell phone batteries -- Li-Cycle is preparing to become a leader in the space, distinguishing itself by employing environmentally-friendly processes that generate no waste water. 
""It's going to be a large, core part of the ecosystem for EVs,"" said Chief Executive Officer Ajay Kochhar, also a co-founder alongside Tim Johnston, who is the chairman of the company, in a video interview earlier this month.
Lithium is a critical component of the batteries that power electric vehicles, and mining it comes with a high environmental cost. To meet the coming need, we're going to need copious amounts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
In the near-term, passenger electric vehicle sales are expected to rise from 2.1 million in 2020 to 14 million in 2025, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The long-term should be even more favorable as carmakers increasingly turn away from internal combustion engines. And the environmental toll associated with mining lithium is leading governments and companies to focus on recycling. Mines in the U.S. face regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition, and President Joe Biden has made it a priority to focus on domestic recycling, including the possibility of direct investment in projects and government funds, Reuters reported earlier this month.  
Li-Cycle processes battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries to recover raw materials, including lithium carbonate, cobalt sulfate and nickel sulfate, that can be delivered back to the battery production supply chain. Unlike the traditional revenue model for recycling that relies primarily on waste or tipping fees, Li-Cycle generates revenue from sales of the raw materials it produces. The company recovers up to 95% of the mass of raw materials found in lithium-ion batteries and battery scrap, compared to what it believes to be a 50% traditional industry average.The Canadian company is set to reverse merge with Peridot Acquisition Corp (NYSE:PDAC_u), itself sponsored by Carnelian Energy Capital, in a deal that is likely to close in July. Proceeds of about $300 million will go to fund expansion. Eventually, they plan to have 20 strategically located global facilities and four hubs.
Johnston and Kochhar met at Hatch Consulting where they worked on lithium projects, and noted the difficulty in sustaining growth without a solid recycling scheme. That prompted them to establish Li-Cycle about five years ago. 
The company has 118 employees and is growing by the week, Kochhar said. It has 51 battery supply customers, and says its costs are lower than in the traditional process, driving margins higher. He said there are 211 battery mega factories in the pipeline today, versus three in 2013.  
Li-Cycle's process recovers more material and ends up with almost zero solid waste, Johnston said. 
Among the challenges is to correctly prioritize as the market evolves, to scale up amid growing demand with the right people in the right places, Kochhar said. 
""It's all around execution at this point in time,"" Johnston said.

The company sold more stock than planned, raising about $4.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter told the Journal. That compares to Uber (NYSE:UBER) at $95 billion and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) at $20 billion. 
Didi is facing an antitrust probe into China’s internet giants, Bloomberg reported. That's driving uncertainty for DIdi and peers including backer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY). In April, Didi was among 34 tech companies ordered by regulators to correct excesses, and the company warned that it couldn’t assure investors that government officials would be satisfied with its efforts or that it would escape penalties.

Swiss bank UBS hiked its 2021 GDP forecast for the euro zone to 5.1% from 4.3%. But the bank warned that the Delta variant could be a risk.

Concerns over the Delta variant saw travel and leisure stocks lag their peers in June, with a 4.9% loss.

Given the tremendous growth potential of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),  Pfizer  (PFE), and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), we think these stocks could be solid bets now. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Since the onset of the pandemic—which hamstrung many other business sectors with severe and various public health restrictions—the pharmaceuticals sector has taken center stage. This is evident in the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF’s (XPH) 43.7% returns from March 23, 2020, to March 23, 2021. Indeed, optimism surrounding the prospects of the pharmaceutical industry is justified given that the industry has become the key to saving the world from an unprecedented healthcare crisis. With several countries prioritizing the inoculation of their populations to fight coming new strains of the COVID-19 virus, pharmaceutical companies are currently focused on boosting their manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand.
The pharma sector is expected to experience rapid growth due to positive sentiments fueled by increasing vaccination drives globally, surging demand for customized medicines and healthcare products, and increasing investments in R&D for developing drugs to meet growing demand from an aging population. The global pharmaceuticals market is expected to reach $1700.97 billion in 2025, representing an 8% CAGR.
As such, we think major companies in this space, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

According to a SpendEdge report, the EV market is expected to grow at a 20.4% CAGR between 2021 -2025. Nevertheless, the manufacture of EVs has slowed down significantly over the past several months due to the global chip shortage and supply chain issues.
There is speculation that the current semiconductor chip shortage could last for another two years, making the EV industry’s near-term growth prospects look bleak.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",UK's food retail growth to slow sharply in short term -IGD,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's retail food and grocery market will see unprecedented pandemic driven growth of 8.5% in 2020 slow to 1.7% in 2021 and 0.9% in 2022, as shoppers economise and the eating out industry reclaims sales, industry researcher IGD said on Wednesday.
It said the sharp decline in growth will be followed by a period of modest recovery, that will see the market grow by 8.1% to 229.1 billion pounds ($316.7 billion) over 2021-2026.
IGD forecast the recovery will be fuelled by rising employment levels, growing consumer confidence, economic recovery and the new channels and opportunities created by the disruption of COVID-19, such as quick commerce.
""The significant dip we're forecasting in the short term is to be expected; many households will be under increased pressures, making shoppers more value conscious. The reopening of the hospitality sector ... will also divert some spend away from retail in the short term,"" said Simon Wainwright, Director of Global Insight at IGD.
""That said, there's an opportunity for the sector to engage with the many shoppers that built up savings during the pandemic and contributed to the estimated 150 billion pound savings pot, by focusing on quality and convenience as the 'K-shaped recovery' takes hold.""
Wainwright noted that longer term the UK grocery sector will remain bigger than IGD's pre-pandemic forecasts, primarily driven by elevated levels of home-working benefiting stores in suburban areas, the adoption of digital technologies in-store which will alter how and where people shop, and fewer out-of-home eateries.
IGD forecast discount will be the fastest growing channel in the five years to 2026, growing 23.8% to 34.4 billion pounds, driven by new stores.
It forecast online will grow 21.4% to 26.9 billion pounds, driven by new capacity and the new quick commerce sub-channel.
The researcher expects the convenience channel to grow 12.5% to 50 billion pounds.

The supermarkets channel is forecast to grow 0.9% to 91.8 billion, while the hypermarkets channel is seen falling 2.3% to 16 billion pounds.

In this scenario, we think it is wise to avoid the majorly overpriced stocks of T-Mobile (TMUS), Square (SQ), Snap (SNAP), and NIO (NIO). Read on.The major stock market indexes closed higher yesterday as U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 16-month high. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index rose to 127.3 points this month, its highest level since February 2020.
However, the Federal Reserve expects inflation to climb to 3.4% this year, higher than its previous forecast of 2.4%. Also, the Fed now expects to make two interest rate hikes in late 2023 rather than no interest rate hike until 2024, as it previously forecasted. So, the market is expected to continue to witness some volatility. Against this backdrop, we believe several fundamentally weak stocks, which are significantly overpriced, could witness a price pullback in the near-term.
T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Square, Inc. (SQ),  Snap Inc . (NYSE:SNAP), and NIO Inc. (NIO) look extremely overvalued at their current price levels given their weak-financials and unfavorable growth prospects. So, we think it is wise to avoid these stocks now at all costs.

The pair signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Wednesday which Rolls-Royce said would help with plans to certify 100% SAF for use in planes. 
In the aviation sector, its biggest business, Rolls-Royce plans to make all its commercial engines compatible to run on 100% SAF, which produces up to 70% less carbon than conventional fuel, by 2023.
The challenge for SAFs is that there is a shortage of supply, which the Shell partnership could help address.

Rolls-Royce Chief Technology Officer Paul Stein said in a statement that both companies wanted to decarbonise flying.
""We believe that working together on these aims can deliver benefits for both the development of new innovations as well as collaborating to find ways to unlock the net carbon emissions reduction potential of technology that is already in use today,"" he said.

179,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 10:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Views on China Harden Amid Human Rights Disputes, Pew Finds","(Bloomberg) -- Negative views of China remain near record highs across the developed world, according to the latest Pew survey, as higher marks for Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus were offset by concerns about its human rights record.
Majorities in 15 of the 17 advanced economies surveyed this year by the Pew Research Center hold an unfavorable opinion of China, including record highs in Canada, Germany, South Korea and the U.S. Some 76% of Americans said they viewed the world’s most populous nation unfavorably in February, up three percentage points from last year.
The percentage of people with a negative outlook on China was even higher in places such as Japan (88%), Sweden (80%), Australia (78%) and South Korea (77%) -- all countries that have had high-profile diplomatic disputes with Beijing in recent years. Only Greece and Singapore have mostly favorable views toward the country.
The report, which comes hours before President Xi Jinping was expected to mark the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary in Beijing, shows the diplomatic challenge facing China as it attempts to assert greater influence globally. Last month, Xi urged Chinese officials to create a “trustworthy, lovable and respectable” image for the country, in a sign that Beijing may be looking to smooth its hard-edged diplomatic approach.
Questions about China’s early handling of the first known coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan helped fuel a dramatic decline in views toward the country. Pew’s surveys of almost 18,900 adults across the 17 markets show some improvement in that area, with a median of 49% saying China is doing a good job handling the pandemic.
Still, the report showed growing dissatisfaction with China’s human rights practices, as Beijing defended its labor programs in Xinjiang and imposed a national security law in Hong Kong. Chinese diplomats have hit out at countries that have criticized such actions, which Beijing views as its own internal affairs.
Majorities in all but one of the 17 have little or no confidence in the ability of Xi to handle world affairs. In Germany, France and Sweden, half or more say they have no confidence “at all” in Xi.
“Despite the widespread sense that China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people, publics are somewhat divided over what the appropriate response should be,” the report’s authors said.
The 17 advanced economies surveyed, which are dominated by American security allies, also indicated a stronger preference for the U.S. in the wake of President Joe Biden’s election last year. Majorities in more than half of the places said it was more important to have stronger economic ties with the U.S. than China, including Japan, Germany, France and the U.K.
The poll was done under the direction of Gallup and Langer Research Associates between February and May. The results have varying margins of error.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 10:53AM ET</span>",Renault revives models of the past for an electric future,"By Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -Renault unveiled a more ambitious strategy for electric vehicles (EVs) on Wednesday, betting on new, affordable versions of its iconic small cars of the past to catch up with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in the fast-growing sector.
The French carmaker's Chief Executive Luca de Meo said it would launch 10 new EVs by 2025 and that all-electric vehicles would account for up to 90% of its models by 2030, dropping its reliance on hybrids to hit the target under a previous plan.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) is betting that an electric version of its classic Renault 5 compact car, which was discontinued in the 1990s, will capture the imagination of today's drivers when it goes on sale in the first half of 2024.
At a live-streamed presentation on Wednesday, the company also offered a fleeting glimpse of its new electric ""4ever"". Two sources close to the company said it was a revival of the Renault 4 hatchback which went out of production last century.
""Today is an historic acceleration of Renault Group's EV strategy,"" de Meo said in a statement.
De Meo said that new, purpose-built electric car platforms and a cluster of production sites in northern France would allow Renault to deliver EVs at a lower cost.
The first of its new EVs will be the MeganE hatchback which is due to go on sale in the first half of 2022.
By 2030, Renault and its alliance partners, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Mitsubishi, will be producing one million EVs globally a year, up from the 200,000 they made in 2020, the French carmaker said. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the world's most valuable carmaker, is already close to hitting that target, with sales of between 840,000 and one million EVs projected for this year.
SHRINKING SHARE
Renault's Zoe model, the biggest-selling battery electric car in its segment in Europe for years, is losing ground to models such as Volkswagen's ID.3 compact electric car. 
Figures from database EV-Volumes.com showed Volkswagen's share of the EV market in Europe soared to 25% last year from 14% in 2019, overtaking the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, whose share shrank to 19% from 23% in 2019. 
In the first quarter of 2021, Renault's share fell further to 15%, tying with Tesla for third place behind Volkswagen on 21% and Stellantis on 17%, EV-Volumes.com data showed.
De Meo, a former Volkswagen executive who turned the German automaker's Seat brand around, has been tasked with helping Renault turn a new page after a troubled spell. 
Former boss Carlos Ghosn was ousted and arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial malpractice, which he denies. Ghosn left behind a sprawling model range with low margins and Renault racked up heavy losses when global demand for cars fell.
De Meo's turnaround plan - which he calls a ""Renaulution"" - is to lay off thousands of workers, cut the model range and improve cooperation between alliance partners on production.
Renault said this month it would combine three of its plants in northern France into a new legal entity, Renault ElectriCity, that will produce 400,000 vehicles a year by 2025.
The company has previously said it will use purpose-designed vehicle platforms, known as CMF B-EV and CMF A, to produce small and affordable EVs.

It said on Wednesday that the CMF B-EV platform would allow it to produce a vehicle at two-thirds of the cost of making the Zoe model now.
""We want to democratise electric technology,"" Renault's de Meo said. ""When you have a car at 20 to 25,000 euros, you have much more chance than selling a car at 45,000 euros. It's as simple as that.""

181,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 10:43AM ET</span>",Global watchdogs float remedies to cure money market fund stress,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global financial regulators proposed options ranging from capital buffers to charges to avoid a repeat of central banks having to rescue the $8.8 trillion money market funds (MMF) sector as they did during a ""dash for cash"" last year.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial rules for G20 economies, on Wednesday put forward a selection of measures for regulators to make MMFs more resilient and reduce the temptation for investors to flee for the exits.
During extreme market turmoil in March 2020, the Federal Reserve and other central banks had to inject liquidity into the financial system to avoid MMFs from buckling under heavy demand for redemptions, for the second time in 12 years. 
The industry has argued that all parts of the financial system came under severe strain last year at the height of the COVID-19 crisis as economies went into pandemic lockdowns.
The MMF sector, with over half in the United States, is critical for short-term financing of the economy and companies, investing in government debt and short-term paper, allowing investors to cash in their shares on a daily basis.
""MMFs are susceptible to sudden and disruptive redemptions, and they may face challenges in selling assets, particularly under stressed conditions,"" the FSB said in a report.
One option was ""swing pricing"" or allowing fund managers to impose transaction costs on those who redeem shares to reduce the impact on investors who remain in the fund, the FSB said.
Another option is for a small fraction of each investor's shares not to be redeemed immediately, and changing how ""gates"" or temporary bar on investor exits are implemented, it added.
A capital buffer of sufficient size would also mitigate pressures from heavy redemptions, although it would bump up industry costs, the watchdog said, adding that stress tests for individual MMFs and for the sector as a whole could also work.
Eric Pan, CEO of global funds industry body ICI, said it was encouraging that the FSB also recognises the need to improve how wider short-term markets function, including commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
""Importantly, the FSB acknowledges that certain reforms, like capital buffers and swing pricing, could ultimately eliminate certain money market funds from the marketplace,"" Pan said.
The FSB has put the policy options out to public consultation and will publish a final report in October.
It would be up to regulators in each member country to decide on the combination of measures, allowing them to skirt steps like capital requirements which have divided regulators in the past as well as industry.

The FSB will follow up with implementation reviews.

Also, because UMC is the first semiconductor foundry to commit net zero emissions, we think it is well positioned to build a sustainable supply chain and strengthen its position in the industry. Let’s discuss.Headquartered in Hsinchu City, Taiwan, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) is a semiconductor wafer foundry operator in the United States, Japan, Europe and internationally. As a global semiconductor chip shortage continues to adversely affect the electronics and automotive industries, among others, UMC has been working with its customers to reduce the capacity shortfall across the supply chain and increase its shipments significantly.
A strong demand for wafers from the consumer electronics industry has led to increased shipments of UMC’s 28nm wafers, which saw 18% sequential revenue growth in the last reported quarter.
The stock gained 271.3% in price over the past year and 11.3% over the past three months. The company’s commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and build a sustainable supply chain may further strengthen its position in the market. In addition, UMC’s recent investment plans to expand its production capacity at Taiwan's Tainan Science Park should position the company to capture new market opportunities in the coming months.

LONDON (Reuters) - After the unprecedented pandemic-driven swings in global financial markets last year 2021 was never going to be dull, and so it has proved.
Vaccine programmes and some of the biggest fiscal and central bank stimulus ever seen have made for compelling viewing. 
Oil's 45% surge will be its best start to a year since 2009, world stocks are on course for their second best H1 since 1998, wood is on fire and amateur traders' much-loved 'meme' stocks AMC and GameStop (NYSE:GME) are up more than 2,500% and 1,000% respectively. 
Add to that another wild run for bitcoin, digital art selling for tens of millions of dollars despite being free on the internet and major gyrations in government bond markets and you start to get the picture.
""It has been extremely dramatic year,"" SEB investment management's head of asset allocation Hans Peterson said. ""The swings have been absolutely enormous. It has not been an easy year, it has been quite tumultuous."" 
World equities have recorded an 11% gain but mainstay U.S. and German government bond markets have had their toughest H1 since 2013 despite a better last few months.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts estimate that U.S. President Joe Biden's spending plans take the running tally of global fiscal and monetary stimulus over the last 15 months to $30.5 trillion, an amount equivalent to China and Europe's economies combined. 
Central banks alone have bought $0.9 billion of financial assets an hour. That has fuelled a $54 trillion surge in global equity values, but also means U.S. inflation is now annualising 8% compared to an average of 3% over the last 100 years.
""The zeitgeist for the first half has been U.S. fiscal stimulus and its relationship with the bond markets,"" said Eric Theoret a global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management, adding it would be crucial going forward too. 
Global markets in 2021 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlrxebvb/Pasted%20image%201624980375516.png 
HOT OIL
Other seismic moves have been the surge in oil, the 20% rise in copper and a 30-40% leap in wood and food staples like corn and soybeans that is fanning both inflation and other markets.
Oil’s hot streak has seen the Canadian dollar and Russian rouble outperform. Metals have helped lift South Africa's rand but not the Aussie dollar. Britain’s pound has done well thanks to the UK’s rapid COVID vaccine rollout programme, whereas the Japanese yen and the euro, where progress on the inoculation front has been slower, have slid 6.7% and 2.5% respectively.
REAL TURNAROUND 
Emerging markets have seen big moves too. Brazil's race to raise interest rates in recent months has seen its currency go from being the worst performer in the world at the end of Q1 to the best, now up 5.5%. 
At the other end of the table, Colombia and Peru have been struck down by political uncertainty and Turkey’s lira has followed last year’s 20% beating with a further 14% drop.
Remarkably, the lira was the world’s best performer for the first six weeks of 2021. Then bond yields and energy prices kicked higher and President Tayyip Erdogan sacked another central banker.
Things have been even more wild in crypto markets where bitcoin soared all the way from $29,000 to just shy of $65,000 in April only to slump back to $36,000 as countries like China tightened regulations.
An explosion in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a kind of crypto asset used to track ownership of intangible digital assets such as images, videos and music, saw a digital collage fetch $69.3 million in March, while the first ever tweet by Twitter boss Jack Dorsey sold for $2.9 million in NFT form. 
The NFT boom https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxlrlqvx/Pasted%20image%201625007234539.png 
From their early year peaks, funds or stocks linked to innovation – the ARK Innovation Fund, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), solar energy stocks, BioTech shares and special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs – are down 15% to 30% although there has also been a rebound since May.
The FAANGS quintet of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have jumped 10% this month for example. 
""We are in a very unusual recovery of course,"" said Vincent Manuel a chief investment officer at Indosuez Wealth Management, adding that many investors were scratching their heads as to why 10-year Treasury yields had fallen back to 1.5% after the Fed pulled forward U.S. rate hike expectations.
""There is a paradox,"" said Citi strategist Matt King. ""The more successful the Fed and the other central banks have been at driving everything up, the more dependent the markets have become on the continuation of that flow of liquidity.""

(Reuters) - German automaker BMW has established a second corporate venture fund, earmarking $300 million to bankroll startup companies focused on sustainability, advanced manufacturing and future transportation, the company said Wednesday.
BMW i Ventures, based in Mountain View, California, will manage the fund, as well as continuing to disburse money from its initial 500-million-euro fund. The two funds bring BMW’s total venture investment pool to nearly $900 million, one of the largest in the global auto industry.
 Toyota  Ventures, the corporate venture arm of Japan's Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp which frequently co-invests with BMW, earlier this month launched a second investment fund, totaling $300 million, with a focus on sustainability technology and startups, bringing its total assets under investment to more than $500 million.
BMW, through five-year-old i Ventures, previously has invested in more than 50 companies, including several that have gone or are planning to go public, among them ChargePoint and Proterra.
Its focus continues to be on early to mid-stage startup companies, many of them based in Silicon Valley.
Past investments have ranged from Boston Metal, whose technology enables emissions-free steel production, to Prometheus Fuels, a producer of carbon-neutral gasoline.
Marcus Behrendt and Kasper Sage head i Ventures as managing partners.

The new fund will invest in vehicle and manufacturing automation, data and connectivity, as well as in companies involved in efforts to reduce carbon emissions in every aspect of transportation, including supply chains, Sage said.
Behrendt said BMW will continue to consider co-investments with corporate partners such as Toyota, Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover. BMW i Ventures and Toyota Ventures have jointly invested in five startups, including May Mobility and Nauto.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) fell 5% Wednesday after BofA Securities delivered a double downgrade for the space travel company’s stock.
BofA analyst Ronald Epstein downgraded Virgin Galactic to underperform from buy because of the recent surge in the price.
The stock more than doubled in the first 28 days of this month including 39% purely on the news of the company securing Federal Aviation Administration’s approval to carry humans into space.
The analyst cited the FAA approval and noted the company remains a beneficiary of the commercial space race.
But given the surge in the share price, Epstein believes the premium is already priced in amid rising competition.
""Furthermore, the development of space technology carries significant risk and the market tends to respond more volatilely to development-related new,"" the analyst note said.
He also pointed out that Virgin Galactic has yet to tell when it would begin commercial services.
A fully-crewed test flight is planned for this summer by the Richard Branson-promoted company.
Virgin is locked in a battle of egos and prestige against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin in the private space travel industry."

However, given the company’s bright near-term prospects with the economy’s reopening, is the stock a value pick at its current price level? Let’s find out.
Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is one of the prominent players in the food distribution industry. But the company suffered a major setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic as several restaurants, schools and colleges, and other foodservice venues to which it sells its services were forced to close. The Houston, Tex., company’s fiscal third quarter financial results were negatively affected by the pandemic. Its revenue for the quarter declined 13.7% year-over-year to $11.82 billion, missing consensus estimates by $202.49 million. The stock's price has declined 6.6% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $75.68.
However, the stock has gained 39.1% over the past year and 23.7% over the past nine months. And with restaurants and other foodservice venues gradually reopening, SYY is expected to generate solid sales growth in the coming quarters.
Given its growth prospects, the stock looks undervalued at its current price level. Its 0.95x and 0.78x respective forward EV/S and P/S are lower than the 2.16x and 1.61x industry averages. Furthermore, SYY announced in March that it has reduced its outstanding debt by $1.1 billion.

Investing.com –  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) fell 1.5% Wednesday in premarket trading after the company’s fourth quarter results showed that the at-home surge in consumption that the pandemic induced is waning.
Demand for the company’s products such as cereals, dough, snacks and soups surged at the outset of the pandemic last year. As more people return to work and step out to eat, that inflated consumption of cooking and baking at home is coming off.
Net sales for the quarter ended May 30 declined 10% from the same quarter a year ago to $4.5 billion. Gross margin was down 20 basis points to 35% of net sales, driven by higher input costs. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share fell 19% in constant currency, at 91 cents.
General Mills expects changes in consumer behaviors driven by the Covid-19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand for food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels.
For the ongoing fiscal 2022, the food producer is forecasting organic net sales to decline 1% to 3%.
Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between flat and down 2% from the base of $3.79 earned in fiscal 2021.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission on Wednesday proposed caps on interest rates for consumer credit agreements and a ban on bundling practices as part of tougher consumer credit rules following the surge in online shopping during COVID-19 lockdowns and the rise of digital lenders.
Existing rules known as the General Product Safety Directive came into force in 2001 while rules on consumer credit to safeguard consumers date from 2008.
The EU executive said 70% of consumers shopped online last year, with new technology products making up the bulk of their purchases.
""We are making it easier for consumers to avoid risks related to having a credit and we are putting even stronger rules for product safety in place,"" Commission Vice President Vera Jourova said in a statement.
""It will also put more responsibility on market players and make it more difficult for bad actors to hide behind complicated legal jargon,"" she said.
The proposal also includes caps on the total cost of credit and the annual percentage rate of charge, rules on tacitly accepted overdrafts and an obligation by the creditor or the provider of crowdfunding credit services to assess the creditworthiness of the consumer.
The Commission wants information related to credits to be presented in a clear way in the Consumer Credit Directive and adapted to digital devices to ensure that consumers understand what they are signing up for.
EU countries will be asked to promote financial education and to ensure debt advice is made available. The proposals will need to be thrashed out with EU countries and the European Parliament before they can come into force.
Some EU lawmakers however demanded more in order to tackle over-indebtedness and high interest rates.
""It is important to us that the range of loans covered by the directive is expanded. We want to limit fees and interest rates, strengthen consumers' information rights and prohibit manipulative advertising of credit offers,"" Green lawmaker Rasmus Andresen said.
Another Green lawmaker, Sven Giegold, lambasted the shortcomings in the proposal, saying it fails to recognise that people in financial or personal emergency situations are often not free to make their own decisions. 

""Many business models deliberately exploit the distress of these people and create dependencies, especially through over-indebtedness. Providers should be subject to responsible lending requirements,"" he said.
Consumer group BEUC however welcomed the proposals, saying the Commission had accepted many of its suggestions.

The deal comes as Exxon is looking to improve profit and slash debt by culling lower margin operations. It had two years ago pledged to divest $15 billion in assets by the end of 2021 and $25 billion through 2025. 
Exxon said the sale includes two manufacturing sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales along with associated product, process development and laboratory equipment, operating and administration buildings, control systems and documentation, and intellectual property.
The deal, set to close in the fourth quarter of this year, will also move about 350 Exxon employees to Celanese. It is expected to immediately add to Celanese's 2022 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.

Celanese expects to finance the deal with the excess cash and the available liquidity on its balance sheet.
Reuters reported in April that Exxon Mobil was exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems division, potentially valuing the business at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese smart electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc said it would raise $1.8 billion to expand its product line-up and develop its technology, by pricing its shares on Wednesday at HK$165 ($21.25) each in a Hong Kong dual primary listing.
The Guangzhou-based company sold 85 million shares which equates to 5% of its stock, according to its prospectus. There is an over-allotment option to sell a further 12.75 million shares that would raise an extra $270 million.
Led by Chief Executive He Xiaopeng, Xpeng will use the funds to develop more advanced smart car technologies, such as autonomous driving functions, with its in-house team of engineers, and will expand its product portfolio. It already has plans for two new car plants in China.
It sells mainly in China, the world's biggest car market, where it competes with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc. 
Xpeng's New York American Depository Receipts (ADR) closed Tuesday at $44.32, down nearly 1%. One ADR is the equivalent of two ordinary shares in Hong Kong, a term sheet for the deal shows.
The stock has doubled since its August 2020 debut but is well down from its November peak of $64.28.

Xpeng chose a dual primary listing rather than a secondary listing as it has been listed in New York for less than two years. Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.
The dual primary listing allows qualified Chinese investors to take part through the Stock Connect regime linking mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, according to the exchange's rules.

(Reuters) - Chinese ride hailing company Didi Global Inc raised $4.4 billion in its U.S. IPO, pricing it at the top of its indicated range and increasing the number of shares sold, the company said.
Didi sold 316.8 million American Depository Shares (ADS), versus the planned 288 million, at $14 apiece.
This would give Didi a valuation of about $73 billion on a fully diluted basis and $67.5 billion on a non-diluted basis.
The decision to increase the deal size came after the Didi investor order book was oversubscribed multiple times, a source told Reuters. The company is expected to debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30.
Didi's IPO is more conservative versus its initial aim for a valuation of up to $100 billion, Reuters has previously reported. The size of the deal was cut during briefings with investors ahead of the IPO's launch.
Investors baulked at the $100 billion target given concerns the company's future growth prospects could be curbed by the chance of greater regulation of the ride-sharing sector by transport authorities in the future.
There was also uncertainty over how an antitrust probe into Didi, revealed by Reuters this month, would impact the business. Didi said at the time it would not comment on ""unsubstantiated speculation from unnamed source(s)"".
The listing, which will be the biggest U.S. share sale by a Chinese company since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised $25 billion in 2014, comes amid volatile and record IPO activity this year as firms rush to capture the lucrative valuations seen in the U.S. stock market.
""The volatile IPO environment helped to lower (Didi) IPO price and valuation looks attractive,"" said Douglas Kim, a London-based independent analyst, who writes on Smartkarma.
Didi's IPO was covered early on the first day of the book-build last week and the investor books were closed on Monday, a day ahead of schedule..
An over-allotment option, or greenshoe, exists where another 43.2 million shares can be sold to increase the deal size.
DIDI HISTORY
Didi was co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng, who currently serves as the chief executive officer. Cheng was joined by Jean Qing Liu, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and the current president of the ride-sharing company.
The company counts SoftBank, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and Tencent as its main backers.
Didi is also known for successfully pushing Uber out of the Chinese market after the U.S. company lost a price war and ended up selling its China operations to Didi for a stake. Liu Zhen, the head of Uber China at the time, is Didi's Liu's cousin.
Didi is the dominant player in China, although ride-hailing services by automakers such as Geely and SAIC Motor are picking up market share. In Europe and South America, where Didi is expanding, Uber has a presence.
Like most ride-hailing companies, Didi had historically been unprofitable, until it reported a profit of $30 million in the first quarter of this year.

The company reported a loss of $1.6 billion last year and an 8% drop in revenue to $21.63 billion, according to a regulatory filing, as business slid during the pandemic.
Its shares are due to start trading under the ""DIDI"" symbol.

ZURICH/HONG KONG (Reuters) -ChemChina is aiming to raise around $10 billion from a Shanghai IPO for Swiss agrichemical giant Syngenta Group, in what is set to be the world's largest flotation this year, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
ChemChina, which became part of Sinochem Holdings Corp last month, is also considering a secondary listing for Syngenta that could take place less than a year after its debut, with exchanges in Zurich, London and New York among the options being examined, sources said. Hong Kong is also being considered but is not a frontrunner, said one of the sources.
Syngenta is likely to be valued at around $60 billion including debt, or $50 billion without, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
That compares with the $43 billion price tag ChemChina paid for Syngenta in 2017 - the country's biggest-ever foreign takeover aimed at using the Swiss firm's portfolio of top-tier chemicals and patent-protected seeds to drastically improve domestic agricultural output.
Since being taken over, Syngenta - the world's No.1 crop protection maker and No. 3 seed supplier - has been merged with Israeli agrochemical firm ADAMA and the fertiliser and seed business of Sinochem.
The prospectus for the initial public offering on Shanghai's STAR market could be lodged as soon as Wednesday, the sources said.
Syngenta spokesperson Saswato Das declined to comment. Representatives for ChemChina and Sinochem could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. 
The float would be bigger than video-sharing platform Kuaishou Technology's $6.2 billion Hong Kong IPO. It will also be the two-year-old STAR board's biggest - a major boost after the eleventh-hour scrapping of Ant Group's blockbuster listing last year due to regulatory trouble.
About one-third of the proceeds from the Shanghai IPO will be used to repay debt, with the rest spent on research and development and new businesses, the sources said.
Syngenta competes with Germany's BASF, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), employing 49,000 people globally. It generated sales of $23.1 billion in 2020 and the United States and Brazil are its biggest markets.
Benefiting from rising commodity prices which helps farmers afford its seeds and sprays, Syngenta's sales increased 20% during the first quarter of 2021. Farmers have also rebuilt their stocks of seeds and pesticides after running them down during the pandemic last year.
It expects to see higher spending by farmers to feed the world's growing population and as changing climate conditions stoke demand for products like drought-resistant seeds.
Demand in China has also boomed, with Syngenta's first-quarter sales there increasing 41%. It has some 400 training centres across the country teaching farmers how to increase productivity.
As part of the listing process, Syngenta has conducted a so-called ""tutoring"" process with banks which is unique to China and sees bankers coach company executives on IPO-related issues.
China International Capital Corp, Bank of China unit BOCI and Citic Securities are leading the float, Syngenta has said.
More banks are expected to be part of the deal at a later date, the sources said.

Companies have raised $8.8 billion via IPOs on the STAR Market so far this year, making it the seven-biggest market globally, far behind the Nasdaq, New York and Hong Kong, Refinitiv data showed.
Beijing has been keen to nurture the Nasdaq-like bourse amid Sino-U.S. tensions that have also triggered concerns about prospects for Chinese companies listing in the United States.

With on ADR equivalent to two ordinary shares, the Hong Kong pricing came over 4% below the closing price for the ADRs in New York on Tuesday.
The company will raise $1.8 billion through the listing, according to Reuters.
The maker of electric vehicles sold 85 million shares in the deal, equating to some 5% of its expanded capital base, according to its prospectus. There is an over-allotment option to sell a further 12.75 million shares that would raise an extra $270 million.
Xpeng chose a dual primary listing rather than a secondary listing as it has been listed in New York for less than two years. Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Wednesday, consolidating from record levels with investors warily awaiting private sector hiring data. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
Wednesday is the last day of the second quarter and final day of the first half of 2021. The broad-based S&P 500 is up 14% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 12% each. 
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both closed Tuesday at record highs.
Investors have bought into the idea of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic, largely shrugging off high inflation readings, with the Federal Reserve looking for more progress in the U.S. labor market before tightening monetary policy.
The ADP National Employment Report, due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), is expected to show the addition of 600,000 private sector jobs, a slowdown from 978,000 jobs recorded last month.
Weekly mortgage applications and pending home sales data are also due to be published on Wednesday. 
In corporate news,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock pushed higher premarket, continuing the positive tone from the previous session after the drugmaker announced its Covid-19 vaccine showed promise against the delta variant in a lab study.
Earnings are also due from the likes of chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), alcohol and food retailers Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), as well as meme favorite Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY). 
Crude oil prices rose Wednesday, boosted by uncertainty over the extent to which top producers will agree to increase supply to the market later this week. 
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 1.3% at $73.94 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.1% at $75.06.
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, delayed preliminary talks by one day to allow more time to resolve differences over production policy.
The group is widely expected to announce an increase in output for August, but the surge in Covid cases caused by the virulent delta variant is obviously causing differences in opinion over whether to allow higher production or to continue with the current cautious approach.
Adding to the positive tone, the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell 8.15 million barrels last week, which would be the largest inventory decline since January if confirmed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the session."

Investing.com -- Under Armour (NYSE:UA) was up 1.8% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as data showed that the retailer is hiring in large numbers, a clear indication that it expects demand to continue further.
According to the jobs analytics database by GlobalData, Under Armour had posted over 2,300 jobs in Q2 – a 151% increase when compared to Q1. This included a spurt of hiring activity in April 2021 – the first time in over a year that the company listed over 1,400 jobs.
“. . .the business is more confident in recruiting for positions it put on hold during the pandemic. The business is also moving strategically by placing more emphasis on direct-to-consumer sales, which necessitates additional roles,” Neil Saunders, managing director of US retail at GlobalData, said in a note Monday.
The company has posted around 800 jobs related to stock and sales supervision since January, but close to 600 were listed in Q2 (up to June 15), according to Ajay Thalluri, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData,
Last month, the sportswear retailer increased its minimum wages by $5 to $15 per hour. In the month prior, it had also raised its outlook for fiscal 2021.
Revenue is expected to be up at a high-teen percentage rate compared to the previous expectation of a high-single-digit percentage rate increase.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 28 cents to 30 cents compared to the previous expectation of 12 cents to 14 cents.

LONDON (Reuters) -Retail investors currently account for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest U.S. stocks index, after peaking at 15% in September as lockdown boredom and extra savings triggered interest in stock markets,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Wednesday.
The retail frenzy from last summer carried over into 2021 with so-called ""meme stocks"" like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rapidly soaring more than 1,000 percent, leaving professional traders perplexed.
The average daily trading volume on the Russell 3000 index over the last five days was $380 billion, according to Refinitiv data, meaning individual traders contributed around $38 billion a day.
European retail investors on the other hand make up a 5% share of total market volume, Euronext recently said.
Morgan Stanley says the phenomenon has prompted many questions from its clients about how to effectively estimate retail activity.
""We find that retail investors tend to prefer companies in sectors they are likely to be familiar with as consumers, such as consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology,"" the U.S. investment bank said in a note.
Applying its own methodologies, Morgan Stanley found that over the five-year period from July 2016 to June 2021, stocks with high retail participation continued to outperform stocks with low retail participation over the subsequent one month.

The bank's number crunching also highlighted that these traders have bifurcated quality preference, with greatest activity in high quality and junk names.
Meta Material, formerly Torchlight Energy, was the latest name to see huge speculative bets by small individual traders. Clover Health Investments and Koss Corp were other names that made headlines on a retail trading frenzy.

The cost of an electric truck is three times as much as one with a combustion engine, Andreas von Wallfeld, told an event to present the model on Wednesday, mainly due to battery costs.
Wallfeld declined to say how many units the company expects to sell, adding that the gradual ramp-up is also due to quality checks of the eActros. 
Parity in total cost of ownership of Daimler's electric trucks to its conventional ones will be reached by 2025, depending on energy prices and subsidies, Wallfeld said.

Daimler will offer the eActros in 12 European countries at first, he added. Other markets such as China, Russia and South Africa are also of interest, he added.
The company in May said it aimed to cut costs and boost profit across all regions by 2025 as it goes ""all in"" for electric and hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles.

Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was down by 0.4% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after a company executive said it is delaying production of one of its newest chips to work on improving its performance.
Intel now plans to start producing the next generation of central processing units for servers in the first quarter of 2022, Lisa Spelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Xeon and Memory Group at Intel, said in a blog post on Tuesday.
The ramp will begin in the second quarter of 2022, she wrote.
“Sapphire Rapids will feature a new microarchitecture designed to address the dynamic and increasingly demanding workloads in future data centers across compute, networking and storage,” Spelman wrote.
The chip giant had earlier said the next-generation Xeon Scalable processor, code-named ‘Sapphire Rapids,’ would be ready late this year.

Investing.com -- Stocks of mall owners and commercial property landlords, who have had quite a run on the market for some time now, are now confronted with the Supreme Court’s refusal to lift the moratorium on evictions.
The moratorium, brought in by then President Donald Trump in August, protects tenants who have missed paying monthly rents from being forced to vacate their homes if they declare financial hardship. They still owe the back rent.
The moratorium has protected millions of tenants but created financial hardships for landlords. The tenants include retailers, multiplexes and various other commercial establishments.
Since March as the reopening has gathered pace the S&P 500 has risen 15.5%, while shares of most mall and commercial property owners have moved up over 20%.
Simon Property (NYSE:SPG), the largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S., has gained 31% in the last four months.  Prologis  (NYSE:PLD) has done even better, rising 34%.  Kimco Realty  (NYSE:KIM) and  Brixmor Property  (NYSE:BRX) are higher by 25% and 27% in the same period while Brookfield Property (NASDAQ:BPY) has gained 14%.  
While commercial property owners will be hoping for a quick end to the moratorium in the not-too-distant future, residential property prices in the U.S. have sizzled.
Data showed Tuesday that housing prices in April jumped the most in more than three decades.
Nationally, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values climbed 14.6% from a year earlier, the biggest gain in data going back to 1988. That came after 13.2% increase in March, and was the 11th straight month that price gains accelerated."

(Reuters) -Outsourcer Serco said on Wednesday it expects first-half profit to jump over 50%, bolstered by its COVID-19 services for the British and Australian governments, but said those revenues would ease in the second half.
The company, which has been supporting Britain's COVID-19 test-and-trace programme with services such as test site operations, cleaning, security and contact tracing, expects underlying trading profit of between 120 million and 125 million pounds ($173.05 million).
Serco, whose roots go back to 1929, has been led by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's grandson Rupert Soames since 2014 and employs over 55,000 people globally in defence, transport, justice and immigration sectors.
The issues that Serco and the broader world face include labour shortages. Soames said it was difficult to hire lorry drivers in the United Kingdom and workers in the custodial business in Australia, where the group has seen the tightest labour market.
""I think that it's going to be very interesting to see as the furlough scheme ends in the UK and in the U.S.. In the U.S., the labour market is pretty tight but we're not entirely sure how that is going to work through,"" he told Reuters. 
Soames has led the group through a turbulent time for the outsourcing industry, which in recent years has seen the collapse of Carillion and Interserve, and now faces Brexit and pandemic-related disruptions.
Order intake at Serco, which this week extended the COVID-19 testing contract, will be nearly 4 billion pounds in the first half, a record, it said.
The company, which this month raised its annual profit target by 15 million pounds to about 200 million pounds, kept 2021 outlook unchanged on Wednesday. 
About 340 million pounds of its first-half revenue, which is estimated to be around 2.2 billion pounds, will come from its COVID-19 work, compared with 80 million pounds a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) -Dixons Carphone reported a 34% rise in annual profit and strong current trading and said it would resume paying dividends after stellar online sales helped the British electricals retailer offset store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It also said on Wednesday it had decided to retain full ownership of its Nordics business and would not pursue a partial initial public offering (IPO).
The group, which trades as Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse in Britain, has benefited from people working from home and buying equipment online.
Its shares were up 2% at 0911 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 40%.
""We are seeing tech being much more important, three quarters of our customers say they're leaning more on technology than they ever have before,"" Chief Executive Alex Baldock said.#
""You've got trends like hybrid working and home entertainment, with gaming now a bigger market than both music and movies combined,"" he told reporters.
Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) reported an adjusted pretax profit of 156 million pounds ($216 million) for the year to May 1, topping guidance of 151 million pounds and the 116 million it earned in 2019-20. It came after it repaid government staff furlough support of 73 million pounds but not business rates relief.
The group proposed a full-year dividend of 3.0 pence.
Revenue rose 2% to 10.3 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales of electricals up 14% despite stores in the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark and Greece being shut for substantial periods.
Electricals online sales more than doubled to 4.7 billion pounds, more than offsetting a 55% fall in sales in the loss-making Britain and Ireland mobile division, which has closed standalone Carphone Warehouse stores. 
The group, which plans to change its name to Currys in September, has seen continued strong trading in the 2021-22 financial year.
In the Britain and Ireland electricals division sales were up on last year, with about half of sales through stores. In the international division, sales were trending positively against strong growth in the previous year.

PARIS (Reuters) - A French appeal court on Wednesday rejected a request by chemicals group Lubrizol to have judicial charges over a fire at a plant in Rouen quashed because of alleged irregularities in the investigation, a lawyer for the company said.
The French unit of Lubrizol, which is owned by U.S. billionaire investor Warren Buffet, faces charges of pollution and safety failings that resulted in serious harm to the environment.
Lubrizol had argued there were irregularities in the initial investigation conducted by the Regional Directorate for the Environment, Planning and Housing. Its lawyer Benedicte Graulle said the company took note of the ruling. 
Some 9,500 tonnes of chemicals were burned during the blaze at the lubricants plant in September, 2019. 
Lubrizol's French unit is under formal investigation, meaning there is “serious or consistent evidence” that points to probable involvement of a suspect in a crime. It is a step toward a trial, but many investigations may be dropped without going to court.
The plant was designated a 'Seveso' site, meaning there was a risk from the chemicals it developed.
Locals complained that a noxious smell hung over the city after the day-long inferno, leading to headaches and nausea.

Soot fell on towns miles away, schools were closed, harvesting was suspended and farmers had to pour away thousands of gallons of milk.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>","After $4.4 billion New York IPO, founders of China's Didi eye global growth","By Julie Zhu and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - From working at a foot massage company to setting up China's biggest ride-hailing firm, Will Wei Cheng has navigated several hurdles on the path to taking Didi Global Inc public in a $4.4-billion New York float.
As Cheng rose to the upper echelons of Chinese technology entrepreneurs, he faced challenges including tough competition, intense criticism for Didi after rape and murder cases linked to its drivers in 2018, and a COVID-19 induced slowdown at home.
While the biggest share sale by a Chinese company in the United States in seven years, which values Didi at $67.5 billion, is a big win for Cheng and co-founder Jean Qing Liu, experts say the challenges are unlikely to go away soon.
The duo will now be tested on their ability to stem losses that widened last year due to the pandemic and tackle regulatory scrutiny amid an antitrust crackdown at home as they set about expanding Didi globally.
Cheng has a strategic eye, is quietly confident and hard working, Didi employees and investors said. Some added Cheng is a micro-manager and his management style could be cut-throat.
""When there is a Will, there is a way,"" said Neil Shen, founder and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China, a Didi investor. 
""Together with Didi and its hundreds of millions of users, we look forward to creating a better world of future mobility.""
Cheng, 38, who favours polo shirts and Chinese history and military books, was initially eyeing a valuation of up to $100 billion for Didi, Reuters has reported.
That target was a result of Cheng focusing on his standing in his generation of entrepreneurs, said a senior Didi source. He is not giving up his aggressive stance yet, the source added.
""He is very keen to build Didi into a global company with a market value of $200 billion,"" said the source, who did not want to be named as he was not allowed to talk to media.
Didi founders trimmed their valuation target for the IPO as investors baulked at the $100 billion target amid concerns that greater regulation of the ride-sharing sector in the future could curb the company's growth prospects.
There was also uncertainty over how an antitrust probe into Didi, revealed by Reuters, would impact the company.
Didi and its founders did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Launched in Beijing in 2012, Didi aspires to become a global technology company, Cheng and Liu wrote in the IPO prospectus, saying the business model was relevant in markets including Latin America, Russia and South Africa.
It already dominates the ride-hailing industry at home since successfully pushing Uber (NYSE:UBER) out after the U.S. company lost a price war and ended up selling its China operations to Didi for a stake in 2016. 
Didi competes with ride-hailing services by automakers such as Geely and SAIC Motor in China. 
In Europe and South America, where it is expanding, Uber has a presence.
Didi, backed by SoftBank Group Corp, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, is due to debut on Wednesday morning New York time.
CHENG AND LIU
Cheng was born in 1983 in a small town in the southeastern Chinese province of Jiangxi.
After graduating from Beijing University of Chemical Technology with a bachelor's degree in administration, he worked as an assistant to the chairman of a foot massage company.
He joined Alibaba as a sales person in 2005 and later became a senior manager at the firm before starting Didi. 
Cheng, currently CEO of Didi, says he got the idea for a ride-hailing platform on a freezing winter night in Beijing when he had trouble getting a taxi.
In 2014, Cheng was joined by Liu, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and the current president of Didi.
Liu, a Harvard alumna, has been deeply involved in Didi's key financial decisions including its merger with Alibaba-backed Kuaidi in 2015, takeover of Uber's China business and fundraising from investors including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Liu, 43, represents the company in external communications, especially during crises. 

She was the face of Didi after two murder and rape cases related to its Hitch carpooling service drivers in 2018, which the founders described as their ""darkest days"". 
She also works on Didi's redesign of safety process.

MADRID (Reuters) - Orange said on Wednesday it will launch an experimental 5G network using a cloud-based open platform and artificial intelligence in July, as the telecom industry rushes to shift services onto the cloud in a bid to cut costs and modernise. 
Orange will build the network in Lannion, northern France, in partnership with companies such as Mavenir,  Casa Systems  (NASDAQ:CASA), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF).
""This experimental network will enable Orange to understand the customer benefit of a fully clouderised network, as well as AI,"" Orange's Chief Technology Officer Michael Trabbia told reporters on a call.
""We'll start small but ramp up quickly to encompass hundreds of users by the end of this year.""
Orange hopes to expand the network, called Pikeo, to other countries in 2022, once it is fully-fledged and able to self-repair thanks to automation and machine learning, with Trabbia noting that Spain might be a good candidate for exportation. 
Several telecom companies have been experimenting with a technology called Open Radio Access Network (RAN), which uses software to run network functions on the cloud, a feature requiring less physical equipment. 
The technology promises to radically cut costs for telecom operators by employing cloud-based software and commoditized hardware rather proprietary equipment supplied by companies such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Huawei.

Orange has said it aims to have 100% of its new equipment be compatible with open RAN by 2025, a plan similar to that of Spanish operator Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), as Europe's telecoms firms face the challenge of ever-accelerating digitalisation amid the pandemic.
""We're seeing big expectations from customers, the industry ... as with the factory of the future: augmented maintenance, high-definition monitoring, logistical elements which we're working to optimise thanks to this type of network,"" Trabbia added.

LONDON (Reuters) -Barclays said on Wednesday it will move its investment bank staff in London into its nearby headquarters, consolidating office space in the Canary Wharf financial district.
The British bank said it would vacate 5 North Colonnade, where the investment bank is based, by the end of 2022 and plans to renovate its towering 32-story One Churchill Place building.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the move was part of a long-term review of its property footprint, as banks worldwide cut back on real estate amid a shift to more home working during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bank has in recent years been shifting from scattered locations across countries in which it operates into a 'campus' model of consolidating offices in one place.

(Reuters) -United Airlines unveiled its largest-ever order for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets on Tuesday, lining up 270 planes in a push for post-pandemic growth with bigger jets for domestic flying.
The Boeing-dominated order for 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 Airbus A321neo jets, worth over $30 billion at list prices, will boost United's domestic capacity by almost 30%, allowing it to better compete for both premium and low-cost travel. 
It builds momentum for planemakers seeking to turn the page on the COVID-19 travel slump, at least in the United States, and signals a strong bet on a recovery in business travel. 
Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said it would ""accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel.""
America's third-largest airline by revenue will replace most of its regional jets and undertake a sweeping cabin overhaul with more premium seats. 
""With a number of startups commencing operations or with plans to, United is putting the U.S. travel industry on notice,"" said Peter McNally, analyst at research firm Third Bridge. 
The order, confirming a detailed breakdown reported by Reuters on Monday, includes 50 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 150 MAX 10, accelerating a recovery in the wake of a two-year MAX safety crisis in what market sources called a partial coup for Boeing.
It especially marks a breakthrough for the 230-seat MAX 10, the largest variant which has begun flight tests but until now has struggled to contain runaway sales of the competing A321neo.
But Boeing's victory over Airbus in the number of units sold was tempered by Europe's continued grip on a strategically vital segment for single-aisle missions that need the most range. 
That allowed Airbus to secure a quarter of the deal in a high-margin niche where Boeing faces a gap in its portfolio, forcing it to ponder a new jet to replace the longer-range 757.
Boeing appears to be calculating that the United deal will demonstrate that the MAX 10 fits the bill for some three-quarters of missions while it weighs options for a larger new model, analysts said, amid thin post-pandemic demand.
Airbus, meanwhile, continues to pitch the A321neo as a ""premium"" product. 
COST IMPROVEMENT
""This is a great time to acquire capacity cheaply - the aircraft market remains depressed - and this will offer lasting structural cost improvement,"" said Carlos Ozores, vice-president at aviation consultancy ICF. 
After initial gains, Boeing shares ended down 1.8%, resuming losses triggered by delays in certifying the larger 777X. United and Airbus both eased 0.6%.
Combined with existing orders, United will receive 500 new narrowbody aircraft including 40 in 2022 and 138 in 2023. It said it has flexibility on deliveries between 2024 and 2026 and the option to convert some MAX 10 orders to other variants. 
United, which unlike major rivals did not retire jets during the pandemic, said it plans to fly the first MAX 8 with the new interior this summer and the MAX 10 and A321neo in early 2023.
The order includes 25 737 MAX ""white tails"" - jets canceled by other buyers during a 22-month grounding.
The airline, which received $10.5 billion in government aid during the pandemic, devoted a large part of its release to a pledge to create 25,000 unionized jobs through the purchase.
United said it expected to earn a pretax profit in July, its first since January 2020.

Boeing, required to add MAX simulator training for pilots of earlier 737 models after software problems contributed to fatal MAX crashes, said the United deal includes simulator data. 
Airbus said a significant number of newly ordered A321neos would be assembled at its plant in Alabama.

At midsummer 2020, many investors began a switch to cheaper European equity from seemingly overvalued U.S. indices highly concentrated in tech firms reaping lockdown windfalls.
The rotation seemed to make sense as the post-pandemic recovery broadened and the U.S. election loomed.
And yet fresh waves of COVID-19 through the Northern winter and November's clean sweep for high-spending U.S. Democrats blotted the performance of this trade ever since. 
To be fair, the euro zone's main benchmark kept pace with Wall Street's S&P500 - both gaining about 38% in dollar terms since June 30 last year.
But other measures are less flattering. Britain's FTSE100 lagged both of those by 10 percentage points, with UK stocks a drag on the wider Europe STOXX 600. The U.S. small-cap Russell 2000 starred with gains of 62%, while the Nasdaq 100 stayed ahead of most with a jump of 43%. 
A year on - emboldened by vaccination and strengthening economic output and earnings growth - the case for the eastern side of the pond and its more cyclical firms and cheaper ""value stocks"" is being be made once again.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) points out that mutual fund flows into European stocks this year have been their strongest since 2015.
But inflows to all equity markets are zooming higher everywhere and the relative picture is far less clear. 
The main problem, according to Goldman, is not attraction of Europe to foreigners. European equity held by U.S. investors alone has almost trebled to 28% over 20 years and overseas investors at large hold 43%.
The big problem is closer to home. Due to regulatory and demographic factors and greater risk aversion, Europe's funds and households stay loaded with bonds and cash - with pension and insurance funds owning just 3% of European stocks.
Much of that won't change overnight. 
A robust European recovery - which saw euro zone economic sentiment rise in June to its highest reading in 21 years - might help. 
What's more, simmering fears of a hit to tech-heavy U.S. indices from global minimum tax agreements and rising antitrust pushbacks against ""Big Tech"" speaks loudly to some rebalancing.
But even here, echoes of 2020 can be detected. Fears of new COVID variants threatening another European summer tourist season are a reminder against betting on premature ends to the pandemic and the biggest politic risk in the third quarter probably resides with German federal elections in September. 
The re-emergence of dollar strength against the euro - as the Federal Reserve leans hawkish while Europe's central banks pointedly do not - is another warning shot across bows. 
EVERLASTING BULL?
But those willing to take a pace back from the news flow may yet be rewarded.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s long-term strategists Jan Loeys and Shiny Kundu doubt the case for endless U.S. outperformance.
""History warns against everlasting bull markets,"" they wrote, arguing the case for strategically underweighting U.S. stocks and showing evidence of mean reversion in relative 10-year U.S. returns versus the rest of the world over decades - coming from reverals in earnings, the dollar and tech sector.
Their conclusion is that people are probably just too overloaded now in American stock and see a good case to hold at least a little less U.S. equity than its massive 58% weighting in MSCI's all-country index. The U.S. economy itself is just a quarter of global economic output by comparison. 
That high MSCI weighting follows relentless outperformance for more than a decade since the banking crash of 2008, as borrowing costs stayed low and the digital revolution gathering pace via U.S.-based but quintessentially global tech companies.
Any diversification gain for investors from being elsewhere was more than offset by better returns on U.S. stocks.
But stretching the sample back 50 years, the JPM research showed 75% of rolling 10-year U.S. outperformance or underperformance was reversed the following decade.
With equity valuations in non-U.S. markets relative to U.S. stocks at an all-time low, a reduction of U.S. weightings in global portfolios to about 50% may be warranted, Loeys and Kundu wrote. And the balance would be best moved to other developed stocks rather than emerging markets now clouded by ebbing potential growth rates.
With Europe accounting for as little as 17% of MSCI's all-country index, the mean reversion argument points there.
And yet many remain wary of Europe's ""cheapness"" and question whether it can take up the slack - pointing to poor relative profitability and margins at European companies compared to U.S. firms and a glaring absence of an equivalent tech sector.

Stephen Jen at hedge fund Eurizon SLJ reckons he sees no clear fundamental arguments why European profit margins would rise from here. What's more, demographics - where Europe's profile is only about 20 years behind Japan's - would continue to see the euro zone savers re-cycle the bloc's current account surpluses overseas, just like Japan has done for decades. 
""The market’s current fixation on the likely speed of the economic rebound in the coming months seems misplaced,"" he said. ""The debate ought to be on what might happen beyond the cyclical bounce virtually every economy is experiencing sooner or later.""

217,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 04:11AM ET</span>",Nasdaq deja vu,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has emerged as the stand-out mover as June draws to an end, up 5.6% so far and set for its best monthly run since November last year. 
Yet another record high close overnight is no coincidence given reassurances from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its mid-month hawkish shift, while the Delta variant has recreated that deja vu feeling of pandemic-related economic uncertainty.
So while travel and cyclical stocks have felt the heat, the combined market cap of the five biggest U.S. tech plays (Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) has climbed closer to a gigantic $9 trillion, which is about 35% of nominal GDP.
But the reopening trade is far from dead and once end-month window dressing by investment managers trying to look smarter about their choices is over, some pundits expect confidence in the economic recovery to regain momentum.
A taste of that came from top Wall Street banks raising dividends after passing the Fed's stress test.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) delivered a big surprise that boosted its shares. Confidence in strong corporate earnings growth is intact.
The day ahead however sees cyclical-tilted European equities heading south with futures down around 0.2% amid rising COVID-19 infections in the UK and elsewhere. U.S. stock futures point to a steady start for Wall Street. 
Japan's Nikkei erased its gains as domestic infections surged ahead of the Olympics next month. In Australia, officials extended lockdown and social distancing measures to contain the Delta variant, putting the Aussie under pressure.
Focus will turn to the June eurozone flash inflation data and the U.S. ADP employment report, which could set the tone for Friday's non-farm payrolls data. Ahead of that, the dollar steadied near recent peaks. 

Finally, it's worth keeping an eye on market warning signals. The SKEW index, which tracks demand for crash protection, hit a record high on Friday, indicating concern among institutional investors of a black-swan shock. The index was last just below that peak. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets Wednesday: * China manufacturing slows as supply shortages roil Asiaindustry * Japan's May factory output records biggest drop in a year * UK final Q1 GDP -1.6% Q/Q * Eurozone, France, Italy June flash CPI * U.S. ADP * Canada PPI * SNB releases Q1 FX purchases data

The Mountain View, California-based company sold 35 million shares for $35 each on Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public yet. The company had marketed 32 million shares for $31 to $32, a range that it had elevated from $26 to $29 on Monday.
A representative for SentinelOne declined to comment.
At $35 a share, SentinelOne has a market value of $8.87 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for stock options, the company would be valued on a diluted basis at more than $10.5 billion.
At least 10 other companies were expected to price IPOs on U.S. exchanges Tuesday, potentially adding about $7 billion in one day to the tally raised so far this year.
The biggest of the group is Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc., whose IPO priced at $14 a share, the top of its marketed range, and was expanded to raise $4.4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter and the company’s filings.
A representative for Didi declined to comment. At $14 a share, the IPO is the second largest in the U.S. by a Chinese company, second only to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion debut in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
$9 Billion Week
Others include LegalZoom.com Inc., which priced its shares above a marketed range, in what is set to be the busiest week for new listings since December, not including the special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that have flooded the market with offerings in the past year.
Excluding SPACs, companies going public on U.S. exchanges this week are seeking to raise as much as $9.12 billion, which would make it the sixth biggest week of the past decade and the 13th biggest ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The top ranks of companies pricing shares in their IPOs Tuesday include:
Shares of SentinelOne and the others are set to begin trading Wednesday in New York.
SentinelOne’s offering was led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Its shares are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol S.
Krispy Kreme
While the SPAC frenzy may have subsided, listings of the blank-check companies continue. Three were set to raise a combined $725 million on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, D-MARKET Elektronik Hizmetler ve Ticaret AS is expected to add to the week’s IPO total when it prices its share sale. The Turkish online retailer is seeking to raise more than $737 million.
Also set to price Wednesday is Krispy Kreme Inc.’s offering of up to $640 million. It’s expected to begin trading Thursday under the symbol DNUT.

The grocer, which trails market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's in annual sales, said its new ""Express Delivery"" service will offer its full online range of over 30,000 products.
The new rapid service has been launched at three Asda stores this week, it said, adding there is potential to quickly roll out the service to more stores if it proves popular with customers.
Each delivery of up to 70 items will be charged at the flat rate of 8.50 pounds ($11.77) and there is no minimum spend per basket.   
From this month Asda will also extend its rapid delivery partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats from 200 to more than 300 stores.
Rapid delivery is the latest frontier in the battle for grocery shoppers' cash.
A raft of new firms, including Weezy, Getir, Dija and Gorillas, are offering deliveries within 15 minutes of ordering, prompting traditional supermarket groups to rethink their business models.

Earlier this month Tesco extended a one-hour delivery trial as it tests consumers' appetite for the service.

Deutsche's licence was suspended after two of its bankers who were the IPO principals left the bank, the source said, adding the licence should be renewed when those two people are replaced.
The person declined to be named as the information, first reported by the Financial Times, was not yet public. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) declined to comment to Reuters.
The city's regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), declined to comment on Deutsche's licence being put on hold.
Deutsche had scaled down its equities business globally in 2019, but had kept a small equities capital market (ECM) presence in Asia, mainly in Singapore.
The bank hired some personnel lately in its ECM division, according to local media reports.
Deutsche did not feature in top 25 banks in the league tables for the first half in the Asia Pacific equity capital markets, according to Refinitiv data.
In Hong Kong, IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically takes the lead in running the IPO and collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners.

The SFC last week fined Deutsche HK$2.45 million ($316,000) for issuing incorrect statements to its prime brokerage clients for 12 years and delaying reporting the matter to the regulator.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's corporate regulator is investigating Macquarie-backed software provider Nuix over suspicious revenue forecasts in its prospectus, as well as its former CFO for alleged insider trading, court documents show.
Court documents show the regulator believes it has ""reasonable grounds to suspect"" the tech company lied in its prospectus ahead of its initial public offering, Australia's second-largest of 2020.
Part-owner Macquarie profited from the IPO in December but the stock has since lost over half its value. Nuix shares fell to a new low on Wednesday, closing 12.6% down at A$2.22, sharply below their $5.31 IPO price.
In a statement to the stock exchange, Nuix said former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Doyle and two of his family members were being investigated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
Nuix Chairman Jeffrey Bleich said the company was ""genuinely disturbed by the allegations"" and would cooperate with the investigations.
In court documents seeking travel prohibition orders that on Tuesday were granted against Doyle's brother Ross, who ASIC also suspects of insider trading, the regulator said it too was investigating Nuix's IPO and its financial statements. 
It specified ""suspected contraventions"" of the Corporations Act in relation to its financial statements for the three years to June 2020.
ASIC is investigating possible false or misleading information in the prospectus, and is conducting a further probe into ""dealing in proceeds of crime"" by the Doyle brothers and their father Roland, the document shows.
Nuix said in its statement it had not received any formal notification from ASIC regarding the investigation into Nuix's IPO and its financial statements.
INSIDER TRADING ALLEGATIONS
Stephen Doyle's contract with the forensic data analytics company was terminated on June 15 and is due to expire Wednesday. He did not respond to requests for comment.
Also on June 15 Nuix announced its CEO Rod Vawdrey would retire, a move that followed two revenue downgrades in April and May and concerns raised by the media and proxy advisory firms over its financial accounts.
In the affidavit, ASIC said it suspected Stephen Doyle had engaged in an elaborate strategy with his brother Ross - a resident of Switzerland who is currently in Australia - and their father to sell shares in the company before its revenue and forecasts were made public.
The regulator suspects Stephen Doyle shared inside information about the revenue outlook to his brother, who then sold 2 million Nuix shares for between A$11 and A$8.5 each before the company's half-year results on Feb. 26. 
Those results missed expectations and the company's shares sank 32% on the day.
A Nuix spokesperson declined to direct a request for comment to the Doyles due to privacy concerns.
In a statement to Reuters, ASIC said it had ""obtained ex parte travel restraints on 23 June 2021 for the purpose of ensuring that Mr Ross Doyle remains within the jurisdiction to assist with ASIC's investigation"". 

The orders had been extended by the Federal Court on Tuesday until Oct. 25, it added.
A spokesperson for Macquarie, which owns 30% of Nuix, declined to comment.

ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - A group of banks, including UBS and Singapore's DBS, on Wednesday announced plans to create a new way of measuring the environmental and social impact of their financing.
The group, called Banking for Impact, which also includes ABN Amro and Danske Bank, will team up with Harvard Business School for the project, which aims to help promote a transition to a sustainable economy.
The new reporting standards will mark the first time such measurements will have been attempted on this scale in the financial sector.
Harvard launched its Impact-Weighted Accounts Initiative in 2019 and it has analysed more than 1,800 public companies to show the ""significant relationship"" between negative environmental impacts and lower stock prices.
The new group will aim to devise a new reporting system that tracks the impact of lending not captured by traditional financial reporting. This could show, for example, if money provided by the banks was ultimately used in a way that caused pollution or helped to create jobs.
""The world economy needs a market-based system where social and environmental impacts are just as transparent as financial profit metrics,"" UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said in a statement.
A number of companies have already tried to put a dollar-and-cents figure on such so-called ""externalities"", but there is currently no standardised method, which would be crucial to help investors to compare companies in the same industry.

The group, which hopes to include other banks, aims to establish a new industry protocol, including rules on how to evaluate clients' impact in dollar terms, by end-2022. Those measures can then be aggregated with financial metrics to guide banks' decision-making.
Robert Swaak, chief executive of ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), said: ""As a bank, we certainly have an impact on our stakeholders. If we understand our impact by measuring and reporting, we will also begin to understand where we can achieve the most positive impact and at the same time reduce our negative impact.”

The 97-year-old told CNBC in an interview alongside Berkshire CEO and billionaire investor Warren Buffett that the United States should take a leaf out of China's book and ""step in preemptively to stop speculation"".
""I don't want the, all of the Chinese system, but I certainly would like to have the financial part of it in my own country,"" he said in the interview aired on Tuesday in the United States. 
Communist Party-ruled China ""did the right thing"" by reining in Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, who has hardly been seen in public since he criticised regulators in a speech in October last year.
Chinese regulators pulled the plug on Alibaba affiliate Ant's IPO and forced it to turn itself into a financial holding firm, a move expected to curb some of its freewheeling businesses.
Alibaba was also hit with a record $2.75 billion antitrust penalty as China tightens controls on the booming “platform economy”.
""Communists did the right thing. They just called in Jack Ma and say, ""You aren't gonna do it, sonny,"" Munger said.
He also praised China's response to the novel coronavirus. China imposed strictly enforced lockdowns and widespread curbs on movement, measures that would be less acceptable to Americans.
""They simply shut down the country for six weeks. And that turned out to be exactly the right thing to do,"" Munger said. 

Buffett said the pandemic had hurt smaller companies the most. 
""I don't know how many but many hundreds of thousands or millions of small businesses have been hurt in a terrible way, but most of the big, big companies have overwhelmingly done fine, unless they happen to be in cruise lines or, you know, or hotels or something,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning as a brightening economic outlook and news that vaccines can counter the virulent Delta strain of the COVID-19 virus boosted investor sentiment.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.16% by 10:40 PM ET (2:40 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.39%. Data released earlier in the day said that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was a better-than-expected 50.9 for June. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.5, lower than May’s reading of 55.2.
President Xi Jinping will also deliver a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on Thursday.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.04%. Data released earlier in the day said industrial production fell by a steeper-than-expected 5.9% month-on-month in May.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.42% and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.57%.
U.S. shares closed at a record, with  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares hitting a record high after the company said that its COVID-19 vaccine produced protective antibodies against the virus’ Delta strain.
U.S. Treasuries steadied as investors digested the latest comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve. While Fed Bank of Richmond CEO Thomas Barkin said he wants to see much more U.S. labor market progress before slowing asset purchases, Fed Governor Christopher Waller argued that recent economic performance warrants thinking about pulling back on some stimulus.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has helped global shares recover from much of the market panic after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The rally has managed to weather concerns about more virulent COVID-19 mutant strains, stretched valuations and the prospect of tighter central bank monetary policy.
“The fight against COVID-19 is far from over, but optimism abounds so much that the global economy is temporarily overheating as a consequence,” Nordea Investment Funds SA senior macro strategist Sebastien Galy said in a note.
“The environment in Q3 should still be supportive for risky assets, though fear of bouts of persistent inflation could alter this scenario. We expect to see bouts of volatility from this,” the note added.
Data released overnight in the U.S. also accentuated the optimism about the U.S. economic recovery, with June's Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence index reading a better-than-expected 127.
The market now awaits the U.S. job report, including non-farm payrolls, for June that is due on Friday to gauge the employment market’s recovery. The data could also indicate when the Fed will begin asset tapering and hike interest rates, as hinted in its latest policy decision handed down earlier in the month.
“A stronger June employment report would help solidify expectations for a tapering announcement at one of the next few Fed meetings,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc. economists Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst in a note.
Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development will meet in Paris later in the day to finalize a proposal to overhaul global minimum corporate taxation. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will also speak on Friday."

The deal would allow Telstra to focus afresh on its retail business after years of costly competition in infrastructure with its ageing poles and wires pitted against the state-owned broadband network, analysts said.
""It should be positive for TLS and allow it to ramp up their growth in the retail business,"" said Mathan Somasundaram, CEO of DeepData Analytics.
""It is an expected divestment but sooner than expected. The new infrastructure entity will have a clean balance sheet and that will allow it to do some big acquisition for growth."" 
Telstra shares jumped as much as 5% to A$3.78 after the announcement, their highest since February 2020, while the broader market was up 0.6%. 
Telstra has been looking for a buyer for InfraCo, the largest mobile tower infrastructure provider in Australia, since November last year when it split the business from other operations.
Telstra will retain majority ownership and continue to own the active parts of the network, including the radio access equipment and spectrum assets. It has entered into a 15 year agreement with InfraCo to secure ongoing access to existing and new towers. 
Telstra Chief Executive Officer Andrew Penn said the details on how 50% of the proceeds would be returned to shareholders would be disclosed at a later date, and flagged a potential buyback with the company's annual results in August.
The remaining proceeds would be used for debt reduction and enhancing connectivity in regional Australia, Penn said. 

Future Fund CEO Raphael Arndt said the investment would strengthen the fund's exposure to digital infrastructure as Australia increasingly moves towards 5G.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 10:37PM ET</span>",China Huarong says cannot determine when it will publish 2020 earnings,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd said it cannot determine when it will publish its 2020 financial results, and proposed delaying its annual shareholder meeting, injecting fresh uncertainty into China's biggest bad-debt manager.
Huarong, in filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Tuesday, also announced plans to sell stakes in a distressed asset exchange unit.
The firm, whose shares have been suspended from trade since April 1, said operations are normal and that it has been providing relevant information to auditors.
""However, given that the relevant transaction of the Company has not been finalised, neither the Company nor the Auditor is currently able to estimate the time required for completion of the 2020 Annual Results or to finalise the expected timetable for the publication,"" it said, without disclosing the transaction.
As 2020 audit work has not been finished, the board has proposed postponing the firm's 2020 annual general meeting, Huarong said.
Huarong missed the March 31 deadline for filing its 2020 earnings, sparking a rout in its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that spread to other issuers, amid concern that a default could leave foreign investors losing out.
Its bonds were little changed on Wednesday, Refinitiv data showed. The mid price on its 3.8% Singapore dollar-denominated bond maturing in November 2025 was last quoted at 66.545, versus 66.494 on Tuesday.
Huarong, which counts China's finance ministry as its biggest shareholder, has been hurt by failed investment, aggressive expansion and a corruption case that culminated in the execution of its former chairman, Lai Xiaomin.
In a separate statement late on Tuesday, Huarong said auditors ""will need more information and time"" and that the delay does not constitute an event of default.
Huarong also said it ""has been conducting its business operation on a normal basis. No material change has been found in the Group's business operation"" since April 1, when trading of its shares was suspended.
The firm, without elaborating, said it intends to sell its 79.6% stake in Huarong Zhongguancun Distressed Asset Exchange Centre Co.

The sale comes as regulators push Huarong to sell non-core assets as part of a revamp, Reuters reported.
The company has also officially nominated Liang Qiang as president and executive director of its board, showed a separate exchange filing.

Raimondo told Reuters in an interview ""he asked for help in that regard, he has spoken to high level officials in the White House. We have responded and we definitely want to be a good partner and I do think it's helping.""
Taiwan said two weeks ago it will allow officials from Taiwan's Foxconn and TSMC to negotiate on its behalf for COVID-19 vaccines.
Mid-June the United States shipped 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Taiwan, more than tripling Washington's previous allocation of shots for the island.
TSMC said in a statement to Reuters that they believed ""getting vaccines for Taiwan would help to protect the communities and ensure normal operations.""
Taiwan has been trying to speed up the arrival of the millions of vaccines it has on order as it deals with a rise in domestic cases, although infections remain comparatively low. 

The request from TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract, coincides with a global chip shortage that has slowed production of manufacturers around the world, including in the U.S. auto industry where it is forecast the crisis will hit the production of 3.9 million vehicles. Raimondo has a key role in resolving the crisis for U.S. companies.
Although there has been no major impact so far on chip production in Taiwan since domestic cases began rising in the middle of May, some U.S. auto executives have told Reuters privately earlier this month they were concerned COVID-19 in Taiwan could impact the flow of semiconductors to U.S. factories.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Lawyers fighting the extradition of Huawei's chief financial officer to the United States on Tuesday presented internal emails from British bank HSBC that they said disproved U.S. claims that Huawei misled the bank. 
CFO Meng Wanzhou's legal team said the emails and documents submitted to a Canadian court showed at least two senior HSBC leaders were aware of connections between Huawei and its Iranian subsidiary, Skycom. HSBC declined to comment. 
Meng's lawyers are trying to add the documents to evidence. They are meant to counter U.S. charges that only junior employees of the British bank knew about the true nature of relationship between Huawei and Skycom.
U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Meng misled HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and may have caused the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on charges of bank fraud in the United States. She has been held on house arrest for more than two years while her case moves through the Canadian legal system.
Her legal team has extracted internal documents from HSBC through a court in Hong Kong, and they hope to refer to them in the case's final hearings scheduled for August.
In particular, the defense alleges that two HSBC managing directors viewed Meng's presentation to HSBC about Huawei's business in Iran. They said it made clear Skycom's ownership structure. 
Meng and her legal team appeared in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Tuesday on the first day of a two-day hearing where they will argue to add more evidence to support her case.

The evidence shows the U.S. argument is ""so defective as to compel the courts to place no reliance on them,"" Mark Sandler, defense lawyer for Meng, told the court.
Prosecutors representing the Canadian government argued that the evidence and arguments were beyond the scope of an extradition hearing.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mercuria Energy Group had a boom year in 2020, buoyed by the extreme volatility seen in oil markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as very strong returns across its portfolio, particularly gas and power.
The Geneva-based firm had its best year ever in 2020, making $786 million, compared with $576 million in 2019, according to a source with direct knowledge and Reuters records. The company does not typically disclose its financial results but confirmed the 2020 figures.
Revenues fell in line with commodity prices to about $85 billion, versus $116 billion the previous year. Gross profit on sales was $1.86 billion, up from $1.35 billion in 2019. 
""This is what I will retain from 2020, a year of extreme volatility and a very strong live test of our risk management fundamentals ... we've been testing all of our extreme scenarios and been successful at that,"" Guillaume Vermersch, chief financial officer, said.
""The results have been very positive, I think we are quite proud of our acceleration in terms of investments in activities dealing with ESG (environmental, social, and governance). It's the key focus for us, it remains the case in 2021 and will be the 10-year focus.""
The firm, founded in 2004, is among of the top five global oil traders, moving just under 2 million barrels per day of oil and refined products. 
However, Mercuria's traded volumes have gradually shifted to be majority non-oil, including natural gas, emissions, metals, coal and power. In 2019, Mercuria's total traded volume was 368 million tonnes. 
Vermersch said that oil only accounted for 38% of the company's revenues and that margins remained thin at under 1.5%. He added that now the firm has shifted to reflecting power more and its traded volumes were 33,412 terawatt hours in 2020. 
The firm will continue to focus on the energy transition and has a pipeline of green projects amounting to over $1 billion.
Mercuria has spent $400 million over the last eight months in green assets relating to renewable energy, power grids and electric vehicles.
Demand for basic commodities, particularly oil , crashed in April last year when 4 billion people were under some form of lockdown. Prices rebounded late in the year, particularly after a push for vaccinations began.

Trading firms had a boom year as they were able cash in on the paper volatility as well as in the physical market where they stored cheap, unwanted oil that was later resold at much higher prices.
Mercuria's bigger rivals Trafigura had a record year while Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s marketing arm had its best performance since 2008. Earnings from trading also served as a vital boost in a dismal year for majors like Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global shares edged lower on Tuesday, as new coronavirus outbreaks in Asia vied with strong U.S. and European consumer confidence, and investors speculated about whether the Federal Reserve would accelerate its timetable to end easy monetary policy. 
The U.S. dollar rose to a one-week peak on safe-haven buying stoked by fears that the highly contagious Delta variant could derail a burgeoning economic recovery.
MSCI's all country world index, which tracks shares across 50 countries, shed 0.06%, as declines in Asian equities undercut new highs in U.S and European markets. 
The Nasdaq closed at a record high, boosted by technology stocks and a government survey showing U.S. consumer confidence in June hit its highest level since the pandemic started.

The Australian S&P/ASX 200 futures rose 0.46% in early trading, while Japan's Nikkei 225 futures fell 0.07%.
Investors are worried about the economic impact of the highly infectious Delta variant. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia are all battling outbreaks and tightening restrictions, and Spain and Portugal announced restrictions for unvaccinated British tourists.
""These are headwinds to risk assets performing well, but if we step back, we are still looking at equity indices that continue to hit all time highs,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. 
Investors are also waiting for the U.S. jobs due out on Friday, the results of which could influence Fed policy. 
Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a gain of 690,000 jobs for June, up from 559,000 in May. 
On Monday, Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said the U.S. central bank has made ""substantial further progress"" toward its inflation goal in order to begin tapering asset purchases.
""A good number will speed up the debate about tapering asset purchases soon and raising rates sooner,"" Leary said.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both registered record closing highs on Tuesday, lifted by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other technology stocks after an upbeat consumer confidence report. 
The S&P 500, helped by a jump in  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) shares on news of a dividend increase, hit a record high for the fourth straight session. The S&P and the Dow closed little changed after a session marked by lighter than average volume, as the market awaits more economic data.
""I think the market is in a digestion period,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. ""We're waiting for that next piece of information that's going to give us an idea of how sustainable the recovery is.""
Market participants are closely watching the nonfarm payroll report due on Friday, which could sway the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance which hinges on an equitable recovery of the labor market.
An upbeat consumer confidence report on Tuesday set a positive tone for jobs data. U.S. consumer confidence increased in June to its highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, bolstering expectations for strong economic growth in the second quarter.
""If there's a strong nonfarm payrolls number this month and we start making progress on the unemployment rate, that changes the whole Fed narrative,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management in New York.
Three of the 11 major S&P sector indexes rose, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks the top gainers, up 0.7% and 0.23%, respectively. 
Morgan Stanley jumped 3.4% after it doubled its dividend to 70 cents per share in the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) also raised their payouts.
All three major Wall Street indexes are set for their fifth straight quarter of gains, boosted by ultra-loose monetary policy, a rebounding U.S. economy and robust corporate earnings.
With the S&P 500 climbing nearly 14% in the first half of the year, investor focus is expected to shift to the second-quarter earnings season, beginning in July, which could decide the path for the next leg of the equity markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.02 points, or 0.03%, to 34,292.29. The S&P 500 gained 1.19 points, or 0.03%, to 4,291.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.83 points, or 0.19%, to 14,528.34.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc jumped 5.2% to a record high after the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine showed promise in a lab study against the Delta variant first identified in India, with a modest decrease in response compared with the original strain. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which rose 4.5%, as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts raised their price target, citing it as one of the suppliers to Apple that could benefit from the new iPhone launch. Apple rose more than 1.1%. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.60 billion shares, compared with the 11.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 38 new lows.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 06:52PM ET</span>",Little Engine No. 1 beat Exxon with just $12.5 million - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Engine No. 1 spent roughly $12.5 million to win three board seats at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), less than half its original budget, for the year's biggest and most closely watched corporate contest, people familiar with the number said.
Engine No. 1 in May shocked the oil-and-gas industry when Exxon shareholders, frustrated by weak returns and the U.S. leader's flagging attention to climate concerns, elected three of its four nominated directors to Exxon's board. Investors said the fund's small budget could become a template for low-cost proxy contests.
The victory against one of America's most iconic companies is even more impressive considering Exxon's market valuation of $265 billion, industry analysts said.
Exxon had said it planned to spend $35 million more than its usual proxy solicitation costs, but did not specify a figure. Its campaign included a website, Twitter posts, blogs, and employee forums, mailings, and television appearances. Industry experts speculated that Exxon's costs could have topped $100 million.
""Our costs for the proxy contest remain in line with our filed estimates. We reject any speculation of excessive costs,"" an Exxon spokesman said on Tuesday.
Engine No. 1 declined to comment.
Engine No. 1, launched in December with roughly $250 million in assets, concentrated heavily on electronic communications instead of more expensive mailings sent by post, people familiar with the costs said. Since the firm disclosed its initial $40 million investment on Dec. 7, it has earned a return of 20% net of fees through Tuesday on the Exxon bet, a person familiar with the number said.
The investment firm also focused more on persuading big institutions to back its criticisms that Exxon lacked a convincing clean energy strategy and lagged on financial returns and focused less on pulling in retail investors, who are often inclined to back management.
COVID-19 prevented both sides from jetting around the world to make their case in person, helping reduce costs, people said. For Engine No. 1, the restrictions allowed its nominees to spend hours on video calls with large investors.

That strategy may not be replicable, investors said, if travel resumes and institutions insist on seeing executives and investment managers in person.
Engine No. 1 pressed the credentials of its board candidates, including the former executive vice chairman ofMarathon Petroleum Corp and the renewable fuels chief atFinnish refiner Neste Oyj. It also steered clear of going negative, something institutional investors often dislike, experts said.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>",Mexico looks at improving contract votes after GM dispute,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is looking at new ways to carry out the worker contract votes that are required under a recent labor reform, officials said on Tuesday, after a disputed vote at a General Motors (NYSE:GM) plant drew U.S. scrutiny over possible worker rights violations. 
Mexican authorities found ""serious irregularities"" in the April vote at GM's pick-up plant in Silao, in which workers voted on whether to keep their current collective contract.
In an effort to avoid a repeat scenario, Mexico is looking at giving inspectors more power to monitor, part of several changes being considered amid pressure from the Biden administration. 
""Without a doubt, the experience we had with the General Motors Silao case showed the need to keep strengthening this instrument and adding others,"" said Esteban Martinez, a Mexican labor ministry official, at an online panel with trade and labor officials from the United States and Canada. 
Mexico's labor ministry plans to allow inspectors to not only silently observe the vote, but also ""assume a proactive role,"" including suspending the process if they detect irregularities or potentially illegal acts. 
As well, the ministry is establishing a requirement for results to be valid only if a majority of workers cast ballots, Martinez said. 
He noted that some unions may choose not to hold a vote at all and let their collective contracts expire because they do not expect to rally sufficient worker support. 
A key goal of Mexico's labor reform, which underpins the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), is to do away with so-called ""protection contracts"" that prioritize business interests over worker rights, and are signed behind their backs between companies and unions. 

The U.S. government last month asked Mexico to review the GM case, flagging potential worker rights abuses that could violate the USMCA.
Mexico's labor ministry has begun talks with U.S. counterparts on a remediation plan under the trade pact's enforcement mechanism and has ordered the GM union to re-do the vote before Aug. 20.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) and Abbvie Inc's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) misleadingly marketed opioid drugs as having a low addiction risk, a lawyer for a New York county told jurors on Tuesday, urging them to hold the companies liable.
Jayne Conroy, representing Suffolk County, also said that the drugmakers and the nation's largest drug distributors - AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) - failed to report suspicious opioid orders as required.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019.
""Profits soared, and our communities were devastated,"" Conroy said.
""Manufacturers and distributors control the valve to stop the flood of opioids,"" she added. ""They have their hands on this.""
The defendants, whose lawyers are expected to deliver opening statements beginning on Wednesday, have denied any wrongdoing.
Suffolk is suing the companies alongside neighboring Nassau County and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The trial in Central Islip, New York, marks the first time governments' claims over the nationwide opioid crisis have gone before a jury.
Hunter Shkolnik, representing Nassau County, and John Oleske, representing the state, used their opening statements to give the jury a preview of their case, expected to include expert witnesses and internal communications from the companies.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which had been a defendant, announced on Saturday it would pay $263 million to settle and avoid the trial. The healthcare company said the amount represented what it would pay New York under a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement it proposed last year along with the three distributors that has not been finalized. 
New York and the counties claim that drug companies deceptively promoted opioids as safe, and that distributors ignored red flags that massive amounts of the painkillers were being diverted to illegal channels.
More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed in the United States against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies over the opioid epidemic, mostly by city, county and tribal governments.

Non-jury trials are already underway in cases brought against the four drugmakers by several counties in California, and against the three distributors by a city and county in West Virginia.
The New York counties had also sued pharmacy operators Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, but they were dropped from the trial. CVS said it had settled, without disclosing terms, while Walmart and Rite Aid declined to comment. Walgreens could not be reached for comment.

The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to assess the technological and commercial possibilities for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) and screen potential customers and suppliers. 
Hydrogen, long used as rocket fuel, in oil refining and to produce ammonia, is an opportunity for the oil and gas sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in May.
The Biden administration wants the United States to advance lower-carbon fuels and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
Hydrogen, a clean-burning gas, produced from water, or produced from natural gas in combination with CCS technology, could decarbonize some industries, such as steel or chemicals.
""Hydrogen-based steel processes and CCS are among the more promising and sustainable technologies currently being developed,"" U.S. Steel said in a statement.
Equinor is producing natural gas in the Appalachian Basin. It is planning to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas in the United Kingdom and is developing an offshore CO2 storage in Norway.
Hydrogen production from natural gas in the Appalachian Basin while capturing and storing associated carbon dioxide emissions could help the United States achieve its climate goals, Equinor's U.S. Country Manager Chris Golden said.
""The U.S. faces a challenge to ensure that energy-intensive industries remain competitive within a net-zero scenario,"" he added.
Today, most of the hydrogen in the world is produced from natural gas or coal, while associated CO2 is released into the atmosphere. 
Production costs of clean hydrogen, however, are higher, with renewable hydrogen costing about $5 per kilogram, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 

The Biden administration has set a goal of reducing the cost clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per kilogram in decade.
The costs of producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal in combination with CCS were around $2 per kilogram, according to a recent report https:// by the Global CCS Institute.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 05:12PM ET</span>","Musk touts Starlink progress as cost, demand hurdles remain","By Hyunjoo Jin and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Don Joyce, a Nokia (NYSE:NOK) manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Starlink, which cost him C$600 dollars (US$486) for hardware and a lofty C$150 monthly subscription, provides ""blindingly fast"" speeds when uploading videos or streaming movies, he said. 
But the beta test customer said he experiences dropouts during calls on Microsoft Teams and Zoom.
    ""If you're in the city and you have alternatives, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you're in the country, like in the middle of nowhere and you're getting pathetic internet service, then it's definitely a competitor.""
For billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk - founder of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc - the success of one of his biggest bets may come down to just how many people like Joyce are out there.
Speaking at the Mobile World Congress event, Musk on Tuesday discussed progress in Starlink technology and subscriber growth as he forecast total investment costs in the satellite internet business at as much as $30 billion.
If the service is successful, it could vastly expand the reach of broadband internet around the world, connect Tesla vehicles, and even provide a new platform for traders and others with exotic internet needs, people familiar with the Starlink plan said.
But to do that, it must avoid the fate of similar satellite ventures that have preceded it.
""Not bankrupt, that would be a big step,"" Musk said last year. ""That's our goal.""
SpaceX's Starlink division launched its ""Better Than Nothing Beta program"" in the United States last October, with data speeds up to a competitive 150 megabits per second. Early reviews are mixed, with some users complaining of the problems that have always plagued satellite internet: sensitivity to weather.
Recent heat waves have caused new problems.
""I'm gonna have to spray it with a garden hose to reboot my internet. ... That just feels so wrong,"" a Reddit user who said he lives in Arizona posted earlier this month, along with an error message saying ""Offline: Thermal shutdown"" and ""Starlink will reconnect after cooling down"".
SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell in April said the firm has ""a lot of work to do to make the network reliable"". The company on Tuesday did not have an immediate comment.
Service should improve with more satellites and other improvements: Starlink has launched over 1,700 of its 260 kilogram satellites so far, and envisions more than 40,000. 
The economics are daunting nonetheless. Musk has said Starlink could serve less than 5% of internet users and still generate $30 billion a year in revenue. Critics called that wishful thinking.
""Is the demand there for tens of millions of subscribers at that price point?"" asked analyst Tim Farrar, president at TMF Associates. ""In most parts of the world, if you said to someone, your broadband service will cost you 100 U.S. dollars a month, they'd be like, incredulous.""
He said there might be wealthy people in isolated areas, ""but there's just not very many of those people"".
He said Starlink would also struggle for enough capacity to support that level of demand, especially as people are consuming more data for video streaming. That would mean ""significant additional expenditure on upgrading the satellites and adding more satellites.""
RURAL SUBSIDIES
Pricing pain could be eased by nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies earmarked for Starlink for bringing the internet to rural areas.
Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX's vice president, said COVID-19 highlighted the need for ""access to quality internet"" anywhere on the globe.
Perhaps more importantly, Starlink said it can drive costs down by building its own terminals and satellites. It has hired engineers from chipmakers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and others to design its own communications chips, a person familiar with the matter said - an approach similar to that taken by Tesla.
Starlink has more than halved the terminal cost from $3,000 and expects it to be in a range of a few hundred dollars within the next year or two, Shotwell said in April.
""Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge,"" Musk tweeted last year.
Starlink also benefits from SpaceX's low-cost launch capability.
""When you own pieces of the stack, you can do really technically sophisticated things at an affordable cost,"" said Misha Leybovich, a former Starlink sales director.
Still, competition promises to be fierce. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Kuiper has a directly competing project, while OneWeb - a collapsed satellite operator rescued by the British government and India's Bharti Group - has vowed to be in the game as well. 
Ahead of Musk's speech at the Mobile World Congress, OneWeb said on Tuesday that it has secured an additional $500 million investment from Bharti, bringing its total funding to $2.4 billion. 
Terrestrial telecom providers, meanwhile, are racing to deploy high-speed, fifth-generation (5G) broadband services.

The rapid spread of wireless and terrestrial broadband, along with high prices, were significant factors in killing previous low-Earth-orbit satellite ventures. Motorola-backed  Iridium Communications  (NASDAQ:IRDM) Inc went through bankruptcy after billions of dollars in investment, while a similar fate met Teldesic, backed by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates.
SpaceX, Amazon and a number of others have ""created quite a race that no one is absolutely sure whether there is a big enough market for it,"" Iridium Chief Executive Matthew J. Desch told Reuters.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",Musk says may need $30 billion to keep Starlink in orbit,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Clara-Laeila Laudette
BARCELONA (Reuters) -Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said on Tuesday that his Starlink satellite internet venture was growing quickly as he forecast total investment costs in the business at between $20 billion and $30 billion.
Without disclosing details, he also said Starlink has ""two quite significant partnerships with major country telcos"" that could help the SpaceX division plug gaps in fifth-generation mobile and cellular networks. 
The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO and founder of SpaceX, a rocket ship venture that seeks to colonise Mars, said investment costs before Starlink achieves fully positive cash flow would be $5-$10 billion. 
""It's a lot, basically,"" Musk said in a video interview from California with the Mobile World Congress, the telecoms industry's largest annual gathering, which is being held in Barcelona.
Starlink, an array of low-orbit satellites offering high-speed, low-latency connectivity, is already offering a trial service and aims to cover the world, except for the north and south poles, starting in August, Musk said. 
It has more than 1,500 satellites aloft and is operating in about a dozen countries, adding more every month. Musk forecast total customer numbers would reach half a million over the next 12 months, from 69,000 now.
Some analysts question whether satellite internet can be a viable business model because it mainly targets remote areas, where there may not be enough people able to pay the high tariffs needed to recoup the investment costs.
Starlink would need a few million subscribers paying about $99 a month each to recoup a $5 billion investment in a year's time, said analyst Tim Farrar, president of TMF Associates. 
A $30 billion investment over a decade would not require a dramatic rise in subscribers, but to achieve Musk's 2020 projection of roughly $30 billion revenue a year would require tens of millions of subscribers, he said.
“It is not implausible to get this number (a few million) to make the system not to go bankrupt. But this is not enough to justify the valuation of SpaceX,” he said.
“The more Elon talks up that he is going to invest tens of billions, the harder it becomes for other people. Obviously, that’s the big part of Musk’s objective: to limit competition."" 
Starlink faces competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Kuiper, OneWeb - a collapsed satellite operator rescued by the British government and India's Bharti Group, as well as Telesat and a number of others. 
Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Starlink needed scale which would lower costs: ""hence the need to partner with telcos.""
PARTNERSHIP
Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licences.
He also said if telecom operators have cellular stations in remote regions, they can use Starlink to allow them to connect to core networks.
The rapid spread of wireless and terrestrial broadband, along with high prices, were significant factors in killing previous low-Earth-orbit satellite ventures.

Starlink is selling terminals for half price, Musk said, adding he expects to bring down terminal costs from over $1,000 to $300-500 in the next 12 months. 
""If we succeed in not going bankrupt, then that'll be great, and we can move on from there,"" he said.

And given the favorable macroeconomic backdrop, the DJIA is expected to remain near its record high in the coming months. So, we think DJIA constituents Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and McDonald's (MCD) are attractive bets now. Let’s discuss.Equity indices are currently hovering near their all-time highs owing to the U.S.’ robust vaccination drive and fast-paced macroeconomic recovery. The second oldest U.S. benchmark index, the Dow Jones industrial Average (DJIA), hit its 35,091.56 all-time high on May 10, 2021. DJIA has gained 33.9% over the past year and 12% year-to-date. And given the current economic recovery, the widely watched benchmark index is expected to remain near its record high in the near term.
The benchmark indexes’ latest surge can be attributed primarily to President Biden’s declaration of the infrastructure deal with a bipartisan group of senators on June 24. Also, the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy should continue to buoy stock markets in the near term.
Given this backdrop, we think two popular Dow Jones stocks, Walmart Inc. (WMT) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) should be value additions to one’s portfolio.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eked out another record close Tuesday as strength in tech kept the broader market above water after financials ran out of steam despite a strong showing from bank stocks.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.02% to an all-time closing high of 4,291.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.03%, or 9 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.19% to a record of 14,528.33.

The megacap stocks traded largely mixed, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) giving up some its gains a day earlier.
Facebook fell more than 1%, after the U.S. District Judge James Boasberg left the door open for the Federal Trade Agency to refile its claims against Facebook, and submit plans to strengthen its case against the social media giant. Facebook also announced the launch of its newsletter platform ""Bulletin"" on Tuesday.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was among the highlights after more than doubling its dividend and announcing a $50 million share buyback program, sending its stock more than 3% higher.

Markets got a boost from positive Investor sentiment on the economy. Consumer confidence rose in June from the previous month and was stronger than expectations. It was the highest reading since February 2020, right before the pandemic upended the economy.
Worries about the highly contagious delta variant weighed on the energy sector, because new lockdowns could stall economic progress. Two days from now, the cartel of major oil producers will meet and are expected to ease production curbs..
The industry’s oil inventory reading for last week comes out after the closing bell, while the government’s own report is due out in the morning. Falling inventories in prior weeks has driven the price of a barrel higher.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.

2. Taxes
The OECD will meet in Paris to iron out the details of international taxation. The negotiations come after the G-7 agreed to set a floor on corporate tax rates of at least 15%, up from the current average of 6% to 7%. The goal is to make a proposal ahead of the G-20 meeting in July.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Google deal with French publishers on hold pending antitrust decision - sources,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) -Google has put on hold a preliminary deal with some French publishers to pay for news content as it awaits an antitrust decision that could set the tone for copyright talks on online news in Europe, two sources close to the matter said. 
Under the three-year framework agreement signed by Google and the Alliance de la presse d'information generale (APIG), a lobby group representing most major French publishers, the U.S. company agreed in January to pay a total of $76 million to 121 publications, according to documents seen by Reuters.
It is one of the highest-profile deals under Google's ""News Showcase"" programme to provide compensation for news snippets used in search results, and the first of its kind in Europe. 
However, no individual licensing agreement has been signed by Google with an APIG member since then and talks are de facto frozen pending the antitrust decision, the sources said. 
Only a few publications, such as daily newspapers Le Monde, Le Figaro and Liberation, had reached individual deals prior to the framework agreement.
""We're still working with publishers, the APIG and the French competition authority on our agreements in order to finalise and sign more deals,"" Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, said in a statement. 
APIG had no immediate comment. 
It is not clear whether the framework agreement might be scrapped as a result of the antitrust ruling in France, which is expected in the coming weeks, the sources said. 
The French competition authority hasn't said when it will publish its decision.
The deal freeze was triggered by a report presented by French antitrust investigators in February, the sources said.
In the report, which was not made public, antitrust investigators accused Google of failing to comply with the French competition authority's orders on how to conduct negotiations with news publishers over copyright, sources who read it told Reuters at the time.
It is up to the watchdog's board to decide whether to issue a penalty. 
One of the key demands issued by the watchdog was for Google to hold ""transparent, objective and non-discriminatory"" talks in good faith over three months with any news publisher that asked for them. 
Google has repeatedly said it held talks with French news publishers in good faith. Many French news outlets disagree.
""The APIG-Google deal is the perfect example of what shouldn't be done,"" said Laurent Mauriac, the co-president of Spiil, an union for independent online news publishers. 
The APIG-Google deal includes the commitment for any signing news publisher to supply Google's News Showcase product, a provision decried by news publishers outside APIG.

Google is ready to hold talks with news publishers beyond APIG, Sebastien Missoffe, head of the firm's French division, told Europe 1 radio last month. 
He added he was open to giving access to some of Google's online traffic data - a key element to determine the value of news content - to an independent third party.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:49PM ET</span>","U.S., European suppliers scramble to secure Christmas goods as cargo delays worsen","By Lisa Baertlein and Jonathan Saul
LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Suppliers to Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other major retailers told Reuters they are placing holiday orders for Chinese-made merchandise weeks earlier this year, as a global shipping backlog threatens to leave many gift buyers empty-handed this Christmas shopping season.   
Reuters surveyed nearly a dozen suppliers and retailers of everything from toys to computer equipment in the United States and Europe. All expect weeks-long delays in holiday inventory due to shipping bottlenecks, including a global container shortage and the recent COVID-related closure of the southern Chinese port of Yantian, which serves manufacturers near Shenzhen.        
The risk for retailers is a rash of out-of-stock items just as shoppers are ready to open their wallets to splurge on toys, clothing and other merchandise. 
""It's going to be a major, major mess,"" said Isaac Larian, chief executive of Los Angeles-based MGA Entertainment Inc, which sells LOL Surprise, Bratz, Little Tikes and other toy brands to Amazon, Walmart and Target.    
His company has toys stuck in hundreds of containers at the Yantian port. If he can't get enough inventory for his retail clients, ""it's going to hurt the Christmas sales big time,"" Larian said.  
The shipping logjams are due to more than just the backlog in Yantian, which is considered Amazon's No. 1 Chinese seaport, - accounting for 32.4% of shipments handled by the e-commerce company in the three months to May 31, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva.
While Yantian port reopened on June 24, a shortage of containers was still constraining full activity, globally cargo ships are overbooked, containers are stranded in the wrong places, and ports are congested. 
Products are piling up on factory floors, in warehouse parking lots, on seaport docks and at rail yards - threatening more backups than last year's holiday ""shipageddon,"" when many items arrived after Christmas.  
Amazon and other retailers did not respond to requests for comment. 
'UNABLE TO BUILD INVENTORY'
Retailers generally are selling goods as fast as they can bring them in, said Jason Miller, associate professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's Eli Broad College of Business. 
""Their sales are so high right now that they're unable to build inventory levels up substantially,"" said Miller. 
If that torrid clip continues, retailers - excluding auto-related operators - would have to add about $65.1 billion in inventories to be in the same pre-holiday inventory-to-sales position they were in 2019, he said. 
Andy Bond, chief executive of Pepco Group, which owns British discount retailer Poundland, told Reuters separately, ""it's definitely a day-to-day challenge and a headache that we are facing.""
Clothing sellers are looking at air freight as an option - including  PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. 
Christmas-themed inventory ""might be here for Thanksgiving weekend - and it might not be,"" said Balsam Hill CEO Mac Harman, who sells high-end artificial Christmas trees and other holiday décor. Some of his orders from China may not arrive in time for his July sales kickoff - or even by Christmas, he said. 
""We're hundreds of containers behind where we should be at this point,"" he said, with at least 10% fewer products in stock. 
Michael Shah, CEO of British-based Easy Equipment, which supplies catering equipment across the United Kingdom, is racing to bring goods in early after already contending with containers held up in China. 
""We are already starting to order more stock now knowing that by September-October, we have to be prepared,"" Shah said. ""It gets busy in the run-up to Christmas with the restaurant trade, and we are having to bite the bullet and try and rush in stock."" 
Carly McGinnis, head of production, sales and logistics at Exploding Kittens, wants to make sure major retailers such as Walmart and Target don't run out of its games. The Los Angeles-based company is making more games this year and began shipping holiday orders in March, about four months earlier than in 2020. 
She also gives Walmart  and Target the option to import some of their own orders. Because the two retailers are among the top U.S. importers of containerized goods, they may get priority access to containers and space on cargo ships. 
""I've told our investors, and my internal team, something will be out of stock - there will be an issue. I don't know when and I don't know what it will be, but it's certainly going to happen,"" McGinnis said.

Meanwhile, Bernie Thompson said he has abandoned hope for a holiday restock of laptop docking stations and some other computer equipment he sells  via Amazon and other retailers. That's because it can take more than 12 months to get some of his top-selling products, which rely on hard-to-find computer chips.   
""It's too late for Christmas,"" said Thompson, founder of Washington-based Plugable Technologies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An electronic trading platform owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will pay a $2.75 million civil fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to register as a broker-dealer for more than a decade, the regulator said on Tuesday.
The enforcement action against Neovest Inc prompted a rare, 2,000-word dissent from Hester Peirce, one of two Republicans on the five-person commission, who said it could thwart innovation and was ""unbecoming of the world's strongest securities market.""
Neovest represents the first SEC case charging an order and execution management system that facilitates electronic trading with operating as an unregistered broker.
The SEC said Neovest withdrew its broker-dealer registration after being acquired by JPMorgan in 2005, yet kept processing and accepting payment for trades, and solicited customers and brokers through its website, banking conferences and trade shows.
Neovest agreed to the fine and a censure without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
Peirce said Neovest did not meet the statutory definition of a broker, and that the SEC in March 2020 excused similar conduct by another firm that sought and obtained a ""no-action"" letter.
""This action will lead would-be innovators to conclude that they cannot enter this space until they have hired counsel, spent months engaging with our staff, and signed on to a set of inflexible conditions on their activity,"" Peirce wrote.
The SEC said broker-dealer registrations help customers by offering greater regulatory oversight, and safeguards to protect their information and prevent identity theft.

""Neovest has taken a number of steps to enhance its security measures in recent years,"" JPMorgan spokesperson Brian Marchiony said in an email. ""There is no evidence that client data was compromised in any way.""
Utah-based Neovest describes itself as a leading ""broker-neutral"" platform that lets customers route orders to buy and sell stocks and options directly to more than 360 brokers.

Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian described meme stocks as the intersection of community and capital and social media and finance.
However, meme stocks typically gain popularity through social media platform discussions, facilitated by retail investors’ rising interest. These stocks tend to be overlooked and are often sold short by institutional investors and hedge funds.
Most of the meme stocks now look overvalued by traditional measures Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), BlackBerry Limited (BB), and Senseonics Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SENS) look highly overvalued at their current price levels given their weak growth prospects.

The government hopes to question, or depose, three people in August, one Google employee and two people who left Google, one in 2011 and 2013.
The government sued Google last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals. That lawsuit has been combined for discovery purposes with a broader antitrust lawsuit brought by 38 states and territories.
""We wanted to let the court know that it is our hope to do all or most of these depositions in person,"" said the Justice Department's Kenneth Dintzer, noting that the three first people that he wanted to depose were in California. ""It is our understanding that California is re-open.""
Dintzer also said in the status conference, which was being held remotely, that he hoped to also return to regular court hearings.

Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia also discussed whether the Justice Department should be allowed to see performance reviews of executives that the government is considering calling as witnesses.
Mehta said that after reading a sample of the reviews that they were potentially useful but urged the government to request performance reviews only of people they wanted to depose. He further asked the two sides to agree on a protocol for safeguarding anything personal in them.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:19PM ET</span>","Facebook launches newsletter product Bulletin, its Substack rival","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -Facebook Inc launched its newsletter product ""Bulletin"" on Tuesday, a standalone platform for free and paid articles and podcasts that will aim to rival Substack. 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the platform, which is live at Bulletin.com, and introduced some of the writers that the company has recruited in a live audio room on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Facebook is pushing to compete in the fast-growing email newsletter trend, as high-profile journalists and writers have left media companies over the past year to strike out on their own.
Self-publishing platform Substack is a leader in helping writers sell email subscriptions, and has lured journalists with cash advances. Other tech companies are also competing in the field, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), which acquired newsletter platform Revue.
Facebook said it would not take a cut of Bulletin creators' revenue at launch and that creators can choose their own subscription prices. It is launching the platform with a number of high-profile personalities and writers, including sportscaster Erin Andrews, author Malcolm Gladwell and ""Queer Eye"" star Tan France. 
The social network has had a tumultuous relationship with the news industry, which came to a head in February after a showdown with the Australian government over paying news outlets for content. Following the conflict, Facebook pledged to invest $1 billion in the news industry globally over the next three years.
The company said the articles and podcasts would also be available through the Facebook News Feed and through Facebook's News section. 
""We built Bulletin on a separate website to enable creators to grow their audience in ways that are not exclusively dependent on the Facebook platform,"" it said on the new site.

Facebook said it was primarily launching with U.S. creators and it was not accepting new ones at this time. But it said the Bulletin site was available worldwide and it would look to add more international names after the beta test. 
In April, Facebook said it would pay $5 million to recruit independent local journalists to write for its new publishing platform.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up some gains Tuesday after hitting a fresh record high amid a chip-led climb in technology and a jump in banking stocks.
The S&P 500 fell 0.02% after hitting a record intraday level of 4,300.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.02%, or 5 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.10%.
Technology stocks continued to dominate direction, with chip stocks leading them higher. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) hit a record high, powered by Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO).  
The megacap stocks traded largely mixed, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) giving up some its gains a day earlier.
Facebook fell more than 1%, after the U.S. District Judge James Boasberg left the door open for the Federal Trade Agency to refile its claims against Facebook, and submit plans to strengthen its case against the social media giant.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were mixed.
Financials, meanwhile, were boosted by a climb in banking stocks after major banks raised their dividends.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was among the highlights after more than doubling its dividend and announcing a $50 million share buyback program, sending its stock more than 3% higher.
Investor sentiment on the economy, meanwhile, was given a boost from data showing consumer sentiment is returning to pre-pandemic levels.
""The consumer confidence index rose to 127.3 in June from 120.0 in May (originally 117.2) and came in quite a bit stronger than the consensus of 119.0,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""This is the highest reading in Confidence since the last pre-pandemic reading of 132.6 in February 2020.""
Energy, meanwhile, traded below the flatline as the spread of the highly contagious delta Covid-19 variant has soured sentiment on demand recovery somewhat just days before major oil producers meet on Thursday and are expected to ease crude production curbs.
""[W]e believe they will answer the call to put more barrels on the market, potentially increasing supply by between 500 kb/d and 1 mb/d starting in August,"" RBC said in a note.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:01PM ET</span>",Heart inflammation after COVID-19 shots higher-than-expected in study of U.S. military,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Members of the U.S. military who were vaccinated against COVID-19 showed higher-than-expected rates of heart inflammation, although the condition was still extremely rare, according to a study released on Tuesday.
The study found that 23 previously healthy males with an average age of 25 complained of chest pain within four days of receiving a COVID-19 shot. The incident rate was higher than some previous estimates would have anticipated, it said. 
All the patients, who at the time of the study's publication had recovered or were recovering from myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart muscle - had received shots made by either  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. 
U.S. health regulators last week added a warning to the literature that accompanies those mRNA vaccines to flag the rare risk of heart inflammation seen primarily in young males. But they said the benefit of the shots in preventing COVID-19 clearly continues to outweigh the risk.
The study, which was published in the JAMA Cardiology medical journal, said 19 of the patients were current military members who had received their second vaccine dose. The others had either received one dose or were retired from the military. 
General population estimates would have predicted eight or fewer cases of myocarditis from the 436,000 male military members who received two COVID-19 shots, the study said. 
An outside panel of experts advising the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that reports of myocarditis were higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose than would be anticipated in the general population. A presentation at that meeting found the heart condition turned up at a rate of about 12.6 cases per million people vaccinated.
Eight of the military patients in the study were given diagnostic scans and showed signs of heart inflammation that could not be explained by other causes, the study said. The patients in the study ranged from ages 20 to 51. 

The CDC began investigating the potential link between the mRNA vaccines and myocarditis in April after Israel flagged that it was studying such cases in people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine there, and after a report that the U.S. military had also found cases.
Health regulators in several countries are conducting their own investigations.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY) has resolved a lawsuit filed in March by a former top lobbyist who accused a high-ranking executive and another senior manager of engaging in sexual discrimination, harassment and retaliation against women in its Washington, D.C., office, according to a court filing on Monday. 
The suit, filed in federal court in Washington by in-house lobbyist Sonya Elling alleged that a Lilly senior vice president, Leigh Ann Pusey, repeatedly demeaned Elling and other women, and eventually forced Elling to resign https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pharmaceuticals-elililly-suit-exc/exclusive-ex-lobbyist-sues-eli-lilly-alleging-sexual-discrimination-harassment-idUSKBN2BJ0KM.
Pusey, senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, was one of Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks's first appointments upon taking the helm of the drugmaker in 2017. 
Lilly previously has denied the allegations against Pusey. A Lilly spokesperson on Tuesday declined to comment. Pusey could not be reached.
As part of the resolution, Elling agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, according to a court filing on Monday. The issues were not aired in court, and the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
""We've resolved things amicably,"" Elling's attorney Lynne Bernabei told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The lawsuit came as other allegations of inappropriate or retaliatory actions by Lilly executives against employees surfaced.
In February, Lilly announced that the company's chief financial officer, Josh Smiley, resigned https://www.reuters.com/business/eli-lilly-says-cfo-resigns-after-inappropriate-communication-with-staff-2021-02-09. Lilly said in a February 9 securities filing that Smiley had engaged in ""consensual though inappropriate personal communications"" with employees. Smiley has declined to comment. 
Reuters reported in March that a former Lilly human resources officer complained https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elililly-special-report/special-report-insider-alleges-eli-lilly-blocked-her-efforts-to-sound-alarms-about-u-s-drug-factory-idUSKBN2B31K5 in a legal demand letter that she had been forced out of her job at a New Jersey factory after launching internal investigations alleging various manufacturing lapses. She has not filed a lawsuit against the company.
Lilly has said it encourages individuals to report concerns without fear of retribution.
Elling's lawsuit alleged that she and other women were subjected to sexist comments by Pusey and another senior manager, including that they were ""nasty,"" ""bitches,"" ""disruptive,"" ""aggressive,"" and ""rude."" 

In 2018, according to the suit, another woman lobbyist at Lilly filed an internal complaint against Pusey, alleging that she had created a hostile workplace and made several offensive comments about Elling and others. Elling corroborated the claims, which a Lilly investigation found to have merit, the lawsuit said.
After that, the lawsuit said, Pusey began to exclude Elling and others who participated in the investigation from briefings of senior leaders and ultimately forced her to resign.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 02:55PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators to more closely monitor advanced driver safety systems,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -U.S. regulators on Tuesday said they would keep a closer eye on the automotive industry as it rolls out advanced driver safety systems, tracking the new technologies to spot potential defects faster.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued an order requiring automakers and operators of vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance or automated driving systems to report crashes within one day of learning of an incident.
""Gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles,"" Steven Cliff, the NHTSA's acting administrator, said on a Tuesday briefing with reporters. 
The safety agency's chief counsel, Ann Carlson, added: ""It is critical that NHTSA has timely access to the information it needs to identify potential defects in the vehicles equipped with these systems.""
Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are an increasingly common feature on many new vehicles, helping drivers with such features as warnings if the car drifts across lane lines on the road and a more advanced cruise control system that adjusts a vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Vehicles with Level 3-5 automated driving systems (ADS) are not currently sold to consumers but are in limited use on public roads around the country.
The new order comes amid increased scrutiny of such systems, especially Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Autopilot system. NHTSA earlier this month said it had opened 30 investigations into Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of being in use.
In addition to the Tesla crashes, NHTSA said it had opened investigations into six others involving driver assistance systems from such automakers as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Volvo Cars.
NHTSA's Tuesday order was overdue, said Jason Levine, the executive director for the Center for Auto Safety.
""The agency has apparently finally heard the Center for Auto Safety’s long-standing call for the federal government to engage in oversight of the unregulated technology currently being tested on America's roads with neither a warning to the residents, nor any data being collected,"" he said.
Tesla's Autopilot system, which handles some driving tasks, received new attention after a fiery April 17 Texas crash that killed two men in which police said they believed no one was behind the wheel. 
Under the new NHTSA order, crashes that occur on public U.S. roads must be reported within one day of learning of an incident if it involves an injury, death, airbag deployment or vehicle tow-away. The companies also must report any accident updates monthly to the agency.
Separately on Tuesday, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said it had completed evaluations of the camera-based front crash prevention system that comes with certain Tesla Model 3 cars. 
The IIHS said it extended a ""2021 Top Safety Pick+"" rating to all Model 3 cars after it gave the camera-based system a superior rating for vehicle-to-vehicle front crash prevention and an advanced rating for pedestrian front crash prevention. The IIHS has not completed its tests on the 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicle.
The Model 3 on Tuesday also regained its status as a Consumer Reports Top Pick after the IIHS tests.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk reacted in a tweet Tuesday. ""Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too,"" Musk wrote. ""Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers."" FSD is a reference to Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" system which it has been allowing certain owners to test.
The vehicle lost the Consumer Reports designation in May after NHTSA said it would no longer be labeled as having some advanced safety features following Tesla's decision to remove radar sensors from its safety systems.

""We are supportive of the UAW, we are partners with the UAW. We believe there has been good that has come out of that partnership and that good is transferrable to other operations,"" GM executive vice president Gerald Johnson said during a briefing for reporters about broader efforts by the company to expand its environmental, social and governance efforts.
Johnson said the decision to join a union should be up to workers, but he did not endorse a so-called ""card check"" organization that bypasses a secret ballot vote.
The UAW can ""make their case without interruption and with complete neutrality"" from the automaker, Johnson said.
""We expect we will work together with the UAW going forward in these sites,"" he said.
GM said on Tuesday it is establishing a $25 million fund to provide grants to community organizations to help promote adoption of electric vehicles. 
In April, outgoing UAW President Rory Gamble called on GM and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to commit to union representation at new joint venture EV factories, and GM responded that its Ultium LLC battery facilities ""are part of a joint venture and are a separate company – Ultium Cells LLC."" GM's partner in that venture is South Korean EV battery maker LG Energy Solution.

In May, GM said the UAW is ""well-positioned"" to represent workers at the Ultium plants in Ohio and Tennessee. 
U.S. President Joe Biden told automakers during a visit to Dearborn in May that they should deepen their partnership with the UAW.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 02:47PM ET</span>",Taiwan to discuss easing vaccine trade in talks with U.S.,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will discuss easing the import and export of COVID-19 vaccines with the United States when it holds trade talks with Washington this week, which will help in bringing the pandemic under control, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday.
The two sides are due to resume long-stalled trade discussions on Wednesday as Washington seeks to deepen its support for the Chinese-claimed island, and at a time when Taiwan is dealing with a cluster of domestic COVID-19 cases.
In an address from her office, Tsai said the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement talks, or TIFA, would include what she referred to as an ""important"" topic.
""That is to simplify the import and export process of vaccines and other medical supplies. This substantive cooperation will bring important help to our current epidemic situation. I have asked our negotiating team to go all out,"" Tsai said.
""If Taiwan's epidemic is brought under control and economic fluctuations are reduced, it will be a further contribution to the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.""
Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has reverberated around the world, though the island's domestic COVID-19 outbreak has not had a substantial impact on supplies.
The island has received a total of 4.85 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to date, including 1.24 million donated by Japan and 2.5 million donated by the United States. Japan has pledged another 1 million, while Lithuania is giving Taiwan 20,000.
Asked if the large number of doses the United States sent to Taiwan was intended as a quid pro quo to ensure access to semiconductor supplies, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters: ""There should not be that suggestion. I will note that they were being cut off from access to vaccines."" 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said China has used access to vaccines for political coercion around the world, including ""disgraceful"" attempts to block democratic Taiwan's ability to purchase them.
China has denied that it tried to cut Taiwan off from buying vaccines from Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), saying it was free to obtain the shots through Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd, which has a contract to sell BioNTech's vaccine in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
A further 410,000 doses of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Taiwan on Wednesday, Deputy Minister of the Interior Chen Tsung-yen said earlier on Tuesday, part of its direct order for 5.05 million doses from the company.
Only around 8% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one of the two shot regimen against COVID-19, and the government has been under pressure to speed up deliveries of the millions of doses it has on order.
When asked if a government-run research centre is in talks with Moderna to make COVID-19 vaccines, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said the government ""will not give up any opportunity"" and is currently reviewing its vaccine manufacturing capacity for international companies. 
""We are reviewing related capacity, willingness and division of labour domestically. That will smooth things out in a negotiation,"" Chen told a daily news briefing, without giving details. 

Taiwan's own domestic outbreak of the virus is being brought under control, but it remains wary about a handful of cases of the highly contagious Delta variant in southern Taiwan.
The island reported 54 new domestic infections on Tuesday, down from 60 a day earlier, marking the smallest daily rise since May 15, when the government raised the alert level for Taipei and its neighbouring city in the wake of a sudden spike of domestic cases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of a consortium of energy companies including Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Inc seeking to seize land owned by New Jersey to build a federally approved natural gas pipeline despite the state's objections, though hurdles remain for the $1 billion project.
The 5-4 ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, handed a victory to PennEast Pipeline Company LLC, a joint venture seeking to build the 116-mile (187-km) pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey. The justices overturned a lower court ruling in favor of New Jersey's government.
Other companies joining Enbridge in the consortium include South Jersey Industries (NYSE:SJI) Inc, New Jersey Resources (NYSE:NJR) Corp,  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) and  UGI  (NYSE:UGI) Corp.
The decision enables interstate pipelines to proceed with efforts to seize state-owned lands without a state's consent as long as federal regulators have approved the project. But New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said the ruling does not end the state's fight against the PennEast project.
""We still have other, ongoing legal challenges to this proposed pipeline, which is unnecessary and would be destructive to New Jersey lands,"" Grewal added, as he urged the federal government ""to take another look at this harmful proposal.""
Climate activists, Native American groups and some states have increased opposition to pipeline construction across the United States, shutting down some projects including the long-planned Keystone XL crude pipeline from Canada. Few pipeline battles have been fought over eminent domain issues.
PennEast wants the land to build a pipeline to deliver 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas - enough to supply about 5 million homes - from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
PennEast said it plans to put the first phase of the project - about 68 miles (110 km) of pipe in Pennsylvania - into service in 2022 and is targeting completion of the second phase - the line from Pennsylvania into New Jersey - in 2023.
The court ruled that a 1938 U.S. law called the Natural Gas Act that lets private energy companies seize ""necessary"" parcels of land for a project if they have obtained a certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) can be applied to state-owned land. The law effectively gives private companies the power of eminent domain in which government entities can take property in return for compensation. 
""Specifically, we are asked to decide whether the federal government can constitutionally confer on pipeline companies the authority to condemn necessary rights-of-way in which a state has an interest. We hold that it can,"" Roberts wrote in the ruling.
Roberts added that the U.S. Constitution's 11th Amendment, which prevents courts from hearing certain lawsuits against states, does not bar the lawsuit, as the state had argued.
""We are pleased that the Supreme Court kept intact more than seven decades of legal precedent for the families and businesses who benefit from more affordable, reliable energy. This decision is about more than just the PennEast project,"" said Anthony Cox, chair of the PennEast board of managers.
FERC in 2018 approved PennEast's request to build the pipeline. The company then sued to gain access to properties along the route.

After a federal judge approved the property seizure, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that PennEast could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court. 
The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, was divided along non-ideological lines. Roberts was joined in the majority by two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, and two liberals, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday tapped New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal to head its enforcement unit tasked with policing markets, changing tack after the previous pick stepped down days in to the job.
Grewal, the first-ever Sikh-American attorney general, has been New Jersey's chief law enforcement officer since early 2018 after a lifetime working in government outside of stints earlier in his career. He previously worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey where he led the office's economic crimes unit.
""He has the ideal combination of experience, values, and leadership ability to helm the enforcement division,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. ""I look forward to working closely with him to protect investors and root out wrongdoing in our markets.""
The appointment marks a change from the SEC's previous appointment of Alex Oh to the same role in April. Oh had worked in government briefly before becoming a defense attorney. She stepped down several days in to the job due to potential conflicts created by her previous work.
Grewal, 48, has a track record of pushing progressive issues, from prosecuting automobile lenders and credit card companies to going after allegedly discriminatory practices. As New Jersey's attorney general he repeatedly sued the Trump administration. He has also targeted cryptocurrency fraud and led the largest known prosecution of a data breach, according to New Jersey government websites. 
The SEC's enforcement unit ""has a critical role to play in finding and punishing violations of the law,” Grewal said in a statement. 

Since taking the helm at the SEC in April, Gensler has signaled the agency will aggressively police U.S. markets. He was pressured by some progressives over Oh's background which included defending corporate clients against bribery and corruption allegations.
Grewal will start at the SEC on July 26.

In a letter to government departments and agencies earlier this month, commissioner Ulrich Kelber said Facebook had provided no way to run pages for institutions, whose feed users can subscribe to by clicking ""like"", in an EU-compliant way.
Kelber added that partyline app Clubhouse, video clip app TikTok and Facebook's Instagram site also appeared to have similar shortcomings, and recommended government organisations stop using them too until his inquiry was concluded.
""We updated our Page Insights supplement and clarified the responsibility of Facebook and website operators at the end of 2019,"" a spokesman for Facebook wrote in an email. ""Questions related to the transparency of data processing were taken into consideration.""
The German government's official Facebook page has over a million followers, and the platform has become an increasingly important tool for reaching citizens who are less likely than in the past to follow the mass media where governments advertise.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 02:08PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks hike shareholder payouts after Fed gives the green light,"By David Henry and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said on Monday they were hiking their capital payouts after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave them a clean bill of health following their annual ""stress tests"" last week. 
Analysts and investors had expected https://www.reuters.com/business/us-fed-bank-stress-tests-pave-way-stock-buyback-dividend-bonanza-2021-06-22 the country's largest lenders to start issuing as much as $130 billion in dividends and stock buybacks from next month after the Fed last week ended emergency pandemic-era restrictions on how much capital they could give back to investors.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) delivered the biggest surprise to investors, however, saying it would double its dividend to 70 cents a share in the third quarter of 2021. Some analysts had been expecting a boost to about 50 cents. 
The Wall Street giant also said it would increase spending on share repurchases. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in after-market trading following the announcement.
Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said in the announcement that the bank could return so much capital because of the excess it has accumulated over several years. The action, he said, ""reflects a decision to reset our capital base consistent with the needs we have for our transformed business model.""
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said it will hike its dividend by 17% to 21 cents a share beginning in the third quarter of 2021, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) said it will go to $1.00 a share from 90 cents for the third quarter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) said it planned to increase its common stock dividend to $2 per share from $1.25. 
Wells Fargo & Co, which has built up capital more rapidly than rivals due in part to a Fed-imposed cap on its balance sheet, said it plans to repurchase $18 billion of stock over the four quarters beginning in September. 
The repurchase target amounts to nearly 10% of its stock market value and is line with expectations from analysts.
Wells Fargo, which for years has been trying to move past a series of costly mis-selling scandals, said it was doubling its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share, consistent with analyst expectations.
""Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have built our financial strength ... as well as continuing to remediate our legacy issues,"" CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement.
""We will continue to do so as we return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders,"" Scharf added.
CITIGROUP
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), meanwhile, confirmed analysts' estimates that a key part of its required capital ratios had increased under the stress test results to 3.0% from 2.5%. 
A hike of that size will limit Citigroup's share buybacks, versus its peers, a report from analyst Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan shows. Juneja expects Citigroup will have the lowest capital return of big banks he covers.
Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said the bank will continue its ""planned capital actions, including common dividends of at least $0.51 per share"" and buying back shares in the market.
Bank of America's shares were flat in after hours trading, Goldman Sachs' shares were up 0.6%, while Citigroup's and JPMorgan's were down 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.

The Fed said on Thursday it was ending its remaining curbs on dividend payouts after finding the country's largest banks would remain well capitalized in its latest stress tests.
The central bank said the test found 23 of the largest firms would suffer a combined $474 billion in losses under a hypothetical severe downturn, but would still have more than twice as much capital required under Fed rules.

ADM, one of the world's largest grain traders and food companies, had paid more than $5.5 million for the South Carolina property six years earlier, the Post said. 
ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson told the Post the company did not sell the plant at a discount. ADM began negotiations with Perdue's former company, AGrowStar, in 2015 before Trump was elected, she said. 
ADM did not respond to requests for additional comment.

EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear group, announced the bid for GrandVision in July 2019, aiming to control the Dutch company's more than 7,000 outlets across the world.
But the planned deal has since been caught up in a legal battle between the two sides, with EssilorLuxottica arguing that decisions made by GrandVision during the COVID-19 pandemic could give grounds for ending its proposed takeover.
Earlier this month, a Dutch arbitration court ruled that GrandVision had breached obligations of the takeover agreement, which meant that EssilorLuxottica was no longer bound to the pact.
""After assessing all our options, we have made the decision to proceed with the completion of the deal without further delay,"" EssilorLuxottica said in a statement.
""The strategic rationale of the transaction remains strong and unchanged, and after two years of efforts and relentless work, we are now ready to turn a page and start a new chapter of EssilorLuxottica’s history, with GrandVision.""

EssilorLuxottica had said after the Dutch arbitration court ruling that it was reviewing its options, including walking away from the bid.
GrandVision, majority-owned by Dutch investment firm Hal Trust, said it was taking note of EssilorLuxottica's decision to close the deal with HAL on July 1.

(Reuters) - European shares ended higher on Tuesday after data showed economic sentiment improved sharply in June, while Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) lifted the German index with a share buyback plan. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.3% higher at 456.37 points, after data showed euro zone economic sentiment hit a 21-year high in June as a steady vaccination programme saw several economies reopen.
While the data did not factor in the new Delta variant of the coronavirus, the improving mood saw investors pile into sectors most likely to benefit from a recovery. 
Chemical stocks rose 0.9%, while automobile and financial services were among the best performers.
""Only in May 2000, at the height of the dotcom boom, did we see more positive economic sentiment than now... The reopening of economies is causing a synchronised boost to both production and optimism about the months ahead among industry, services and consumers,"" ING analysts wrote in a note. 
German shares were the best performers, adding 0.9%. Adidas rose 2.5% to a record high after the sportswear maker said it will launch a new share buyback programme worth up to 550 million euros ($654 million).
German inflation also eased in June, quelling some fears over increasing price pressures. But the reading remained above the central bank's target.
Optimism around a steady economic recovery has put the European benchmark on course for its fifth straight month of gains, but it has recently struggled to break above its all-time closing high on June 16 on concerns over the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Travel-related European stocks fell 0.2% after their worst session in more than a month, following reports of a potential ban on UK travellers in Germany. Spain also tightened travel rules for British tourists.
""Concerns (are) growing that the race between the vaccine and the virus is being lost,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Among individual stocks, French electrical parts supplier Rexel jumped 4.3% after it lifted its 2021 sales forecast.

Knorr Bremse fell more than 12% to the bottom of the STOXX 600, after Reuters reported the German brakes maker, along with French auto plastic suppliers Plastic Omnium and Faurecia were interested in buying German automotive lighting group Hella.
Hella surged nearly 4% on the news.

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","U.S. Should Distance From Trump-Era Trade, Key EU Official Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration should take a different approach to trade than that of its predecessor to help improve the U.S. economy, a key European Commission trade official said.
The new U.S. government should “distance themselves clearly from the previous administration, which tried to negotiate rules bilaterally and enforce them unilaterally at great cost to the U.S. economy,” Director General for Trade Sabine Weyand said in a virtual discussion Tuesday. “I think this recognition of economic reality would already be a good starting point.”
“What we need to see is a clear sense of engagement and the recognition that you need to also integrate into the world trading system in a manner which is acceptable for everyone else,” she said.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo are playing key roles in implementing President Joe Biden’s trade policy, which they’re focusing on workers and the middle class. The administration is still reviewing the China policies it inherited from former President Donald Trump -- including tariffs on more than $300 billion in annual imports, and a partial trade deal -- but has indicated that its strategy will be broadly similar.
The Trump administration’s 2018 tariffs on aluminum and steel, which it justified on national-security grounds, also remain in place. Tai has defended them, saying in May that they “have really roiled our economy, but were necessary to address a global overcapacity problem driven largely but not solely by China.” The EU is working toward having the U.S. lift the metal imports by the end of the year, EU Ambassador to Washington Stavros Lambrinidis said June 21.
The transatlantic partners are trying to improve their trade relations. At a summit earlier this month, they agreed to extend a truce over aircraft subsidies for five years, creating breathing space to work out issues in the 17-year dispute that saw tariffs levied on $11.5 billion of exports.
Reforming the World Trade Organization’s dispute-settlement process is an area where there is “a large degree of agreement, of convergence between the EU and the U.S.” on what’s needed, Weyand said.
The dispute system has been hobbled since 2019, after the Trump administration unilaterally opposed all new appointments to the seven-member appellate panel, saying it had overstepped its mandate. The Biden administration this week said it would not agree to appoint new members to the body because the U.S. “continues to have systemic concerns” with the functioning of the panel.
“The WTO dispute-settlement function has not helped the partners to find solution. So, I think we need to really streamline process and make sure that this is fit for purpose,” she said.
Weyand said she hopes to see a work program toward getting the dispute process functioning again by the WTO’s next ministerial conference at the end of November.
“We’re not going to kill the process by being overly ambitious, but at the same time, we need to see a real sense of engagement,” she said.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",Twitter faces three police cases amid growing challenges in India,"By Saurabh Sharma and Sankalp Phartiyal
LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) -Police in India have registered three new cases against  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) for allegedly hurting sentiments and promoting child pornography, marking an escalation in the row between the U.S. firm and Indian authorities.
Police in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have named Twitter India chief Manish Maheshwari in complaints after the politically sensitive regions were depicted outside a map of India on its careers website. 
Late on Tuesday, police in the capital New Delhi said in a statement they have registered a case against Twitter for ""availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material"" on its platform.
Twitter did not comment on cases related to India's map. On the New Delhi case, Twitter said it has a zero tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation.
The police cases come as Twitter faces a public relations nightmare and a backlash from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal government that has in recent weeks repeatedly criticized it for not complying with a new set of IT rules. 
The tussle, coupled with discontent over the regulatory scrutiny of other U.S. tech firms like WhatsApp and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has upset the business environment in a key growth markets, so much so that some companies are rethinking expansion plans.
The latest complaints against Twitter were triggered following an uproar on social media after a map on Twitter's careers page showed Jammu and Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, as well as the Buddhist enclave of Ladakh, outside India. As of Tuesday, the map was no longer visible on its site.
""This has hurt my sentiments and those of the people of India,"" Praveen Bhati, a leader of a hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal in Uttar Pradesh, said in the complaint which was reviewed by Reuters. He also called it an act of treason.
The child pornography case in New Delhi was registered after India's National Commission for Protection of Child Rights wrote to police saying it had received a complaint about online threats against a minor girl, and found pornographic material on Twitter, according to a letter written by the rights group to police.
""Investigation has been taken up,"" the Delhi police statement said.
The cases are set to amplify Twitter's troubles in India. Technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has criticised Twitter for its failure to abide by the IT rules in recent weeks, which came into effect in May.
Companies such as Twitter must now appoint a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer and another executive to liaise with law enforcement and the government on legal requests. LinkedIn job postings show the three positions are open at Twitter.

Non-compliance with those rules means Twitter may no longer enjoy the legal privilege in India that allowed it to not be held liable for user-generated content, lawyers and government sources say. Activists however defend Twitter, saying only courts can arrive at that decision.
Twitter India chief Maheshwari is battling another police case where he has been summoned to answer allegations that include inciting ""hate and enmity"" between Hindu and Muslim communities in relation to a video that went viral on its platform. A state court last week said no ""coercive action"" should be taken against Maheshwari in the case.

As such, the industry could witness extreme volatility in the coming months. Considering this, we believe fundamentally weak cannabis stocks HEXO Corp (NYSE:HEXO), 22nd Century (NYSE:XXII), and Akerna (NASDAQ:KERN) are best avoided now.The cannabis revolution is gaining traction in the United States as the legalization of recreational and medical cannabis picks up steam at a dramatic pace. So far, 18 states and Washington, DC, have legalized the use and cultivation of recreational cannabis. So, approximately 44% of the U.S. population now lives in a state where recreational use of marijuana is legal, or soon will be.
However, pot legalization at the federal level still faces a roadblock. Despite the fact that the MORE Act, which was reintroduced last month by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level is likely to be passed by the Democratically controlled House of Representatives, the Senate’s decision position remains uncertain. And since the chamber's disagreement could stall the federal legalization process further, the cannabis industry is expected to witness significant stock market volatility in the coming months.
Given the uncertainty surrounding federal legalization of cannabis, we think it's best to avoid cannabis companies that don’t possess good financial health. To that end, we believe HEXO Corp. (HEXO), 22nd Century Group Inc. (XXII), and Akerna Corp. (KERN) are best avoided now.

Also, Wall Street analysts expect the prices of these stocks to tumble in the coming months. Hence, we think it’s best to avoid these names now.The tech space has been recovering lately due to increasing demand for advanced technologies in almost every industry. The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep benchmark interest rates unchanged for now is also a growth catalyst for the industry. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been hitting new highs lately. Indeed, it hit its $14,505.19 all-time high yesterday.

However, investor interest is also leading to sky-high valuations for some fundamentally weak tech stocks.
For instance, we do not believe the current valuation levels of Appian Corporation (APPN) and Asana, Inc. (ASAN) are justified by their financials and growth prospects. In fact, Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to retreat in the near term. So, it’s wise to avoid these stocks now.

The company said outages planned for Tuesday ""are a protective measure intended to minimize the customer impact, alleviate strain on the electric system and prevent extensive damage to the system that could result in prolonged outages.""
""The electric system experienced a new peak demand, and the strain of the high temperatures impacted the system in a way that required us to proactively turn off power for some customers,"" Avista CEO Dennis Vermillion said in a news release.

High temperatures in Seattle, the biggest city in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, will reach 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) on Tuesday, down from a record 104 F on Monday, according to forecasts by AccuWeather. That compares with a normal high of just 73 F at this time of year.
Power prices in the Pacific Northwest for Tuesday eased with the Mid Columbia (Mid C) hub in Washington state down to $146 per megawatt hour (MWh) from a record $334 for Monday.
That compares with an average of $30 per MWh at the Mid C over the past five years (2016-2020).
Avista urged all 400,000 of its power customers in Washington, Idaho and Oregon to conserve energy and warned that many of the roughly 8,000 homes and businesses that experienced outages on Monday could have the same thing happen on Tuesday.

The company said the outages will be targeted during the hours of 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. local time and are expected to last one hour.
Some customers may experience more than one outage with no less than one hour in between outages.

Sailings on its new ship, Odyssey Of The Seas, was also postponed after crew members had tested positive.
In Florida, the government bars companies from requiring to show proof of vaccines, making it difficult for cruise operators which, as per U.S. health regulators' orders, need to show a majority of its passengers and crew are vaccinated before setting sail.

(Reuters) - Ohio's Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for the state's attorney general to move forward with a lawsuit against Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) over its ""Dieselgate"" scandal and manipulation of emissions-control systems.
The court ruled 6-1 that the federal Clean Air Act did not pre-empt state law-based claims that Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost is pursuing, or prohibit state oversight after a vehicle or engine is sold.
""This is a major decision that will ensure that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) can be held accountable,"" Yost said in a statement.
VW promised an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying the decision could create ""regulatory chaos"" and inhibit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate emissions by giving state and local governments overlapping authority.
The German automaker has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.
VW admitted in 2015 to having secretly used illegal software to evade emissions rules, and pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
Ohio sued in 2016, accusing VW of conducting deceptive recalls and updates of diesel vehicles that were sold or leased in the state.
A trial judge said federal law pre-empted Ohio's claims, but a mid-level appeals court revived the state's case, prompting VW to appeal.
In upholding the appeals court ruling, Justice Patrick Fischer said federal law did not pre-empt or conflict with Ohio's claims that VW violated the state's Air Pollution Control Act through the post-sale tampering with vehicles' emissions-control systems.
That, he said, made VW's fear it could be punished for following Ohio law ""unfounded.""

""There is no conflict between the relevant federal and state statutes or any obstacle to Congress's objectives,"" Fischer wrote.
Justice Michael Donnelly dissented, and said the case could theoretically result in a more than $1 trillion judgment.

In 2020, the stock has mostly been range-bound. However, the stock remains quite overvalued and there are indications that it could fall back to Earth in the coming months.The combination of the stimulus, Fed policy, and lockdowns was a potent combination that led to extraordinary moves in many growth and momentum stocks in 2020. One of the most notable of these stocks was Tesla (TSLA), which climbed by 1,185% between the March 2020 stock market bottom and its peak in mid-January. 
Since January TSLA and many other growth stocks retreated, as money flowed into value and cyclical stocks due to rising interest rates and increasing optimism about the economy returning to normal. However, over the last couple of months, many technology and growth stocks have been rallying and recovered the bulk of their losses, with a handful even making new highs. 
TSLA is up 25% since mid-May and bulls are optimistic shares will continue climbing higher. I am not one of those bulls. I view the recent rally in TSLA as an opportunity for investors to take a short position in the stock. The major vulnerabilities that I see in Tesla are slowing sales in China, slowing sales growth as competitors are launching new EV models and some of CEO and founder Elon Musk’s allure wearing off.

Investing.com – Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) rose 1.2% during Tuesday’s trading after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)Stanley raised the target for the stock to $70, an upside potential of approximately 23% from the stock’s current level of $56.78.
Analyst Benjamin Swinburne reiterated his overweight while discussing higher expectations at Comcast subsidiaries NBCUniversal and Sky.
Swinburne updated his view with an earlier than expected return to buybacks and a materially higher earnings outlook at Sky because of the three-year extension at a flat cost for its largest cost item -- the English Premier League.
“While we assume the company will reinvest some of those savings into entertainment content, it significantly increases their chances of outperforming and we are above consensus at Sky over the next several years,” he wrote in his report, according to StreetInsider.
According to the analyst, NBCU will likely see several years of elevated growth. The bank expects NBCU to contribute almost 40% of Comcast's consolidated 10% earnings compound annual growth rate from 2020 through 2024.
NBCU owns and operates a portfolio of news and entertainment television networks, a motion picture company, significant TV production operations, theme parks, and a premium ad-supported streaming service.
Sky operates media and telecom businesses in Europe.

289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>","New York, Washington, D.C., Got Some of Smallest Stimulus Checks","(Bloomberg) -- Residents of states in the Midwest and West received the largest of this year’s stimulus payments, on average, while those living in the Northeast received some of the smallest, according to new data from the Treasury Department.
Residents of Utah and Idaho -- where the number of children per family is consistently among the highest in the country -- got the biggest payments, with households in those states receiving about $2,784 and $2,628, respectively, from the American Rescue Plan that President Joe Biden signed into law in March, Treasury Department data showed on Tuesday. Nebraska, South Dakota and Kansas were among those atop the list.
Residents of Washington, D.C., received the smallest payments -- $1,965 -- on average, according to the data. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York rounded out the bottom five. New England families have typically had the fewest children compared with other states.
The data show the geographic variation for the $1,400 stimulus payments, which lawmakers have touted as some of the most important anti-poverty relief distributed during the pandemic to help keep households afloat. Congress approved three rounds of stimulus checks in 2020 and early 2021. Household size was one of the largest contributing factors to the amounts of the payments, with each family member receiving up to $1,400 in the March round, subject to income thresholds.
Individuals earning up to $75,000 or couples making less than $150,000 qualified for $1,400 payments for themselves and each adult or child dependent, in the March 2021 legislation. The payments phased out as income rose, with singles making $80,000 or couples earning $160,000 not qualifying for any aid.
The data show that the Treasury Department had distributed about 95% of the payments as of early June, with only about $20 billion of the projected $410 billion in payments left to be sent out.
More than half of the relief was distributed to households making less than $50,000 a year, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Some 10% went to those receiving federal assistance including Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits, and to those who had incomes below the requirement to file a tax return.
With the number vaccinated individuals rising, employment levels increasing and the economy reopening, lawmakers are unlikely to approve a fourth stimulus round this year. However, Congress also in March approved an expanded child tax credit for up to $3,600 in benefits for children five and under or up to $3,000 for children six and older.
Those payments will be sent out in monthly installments, with the first advance payments scheduled to arrive in mid-July.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis AG wants Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) to return $210 million after accusing its Swiss rival of inappropriately pocketing fees from a 16-year-old patent licensing agreement, according to a lawsuit in U.S. District Court.
The dispute, launched by Novartis in a California state court but recently shifted to a federal court, stems from a 2005 deal requiring U.S.-based Chiron Corp to make payments to Roche's U.S. Genentech unit for use of its intellectual property. 
In 2006, Novartis bought Chiron, a maker of biological drugs and vaccines, and continued making the payments to Roche as it developed products like inflammation drug Ilaris, with revenue of roughly $900 million annually, and psoriasis drug Cosentyx, Novartis's current top seller at around $4 billion annually.
""Novartis subsequently discovered that it mistakenly overpaid,"" Novartis lawyers wrote in a heavily redacted complaint published last Thursday in the U.S. District Court in California. 
""Genentech was aware or should have been aware that Novartis had overpaid ... to Genentech throughout the term of the Agreement,"" Novartis lawyers wrote. ""By mistake, Novartis overpaid ... to Genentech on its drug products, Ilaris and Cosentyx, to which Genentech was not entitled.""
Roche has long owned lucrative patents needed by other companies to make biological drugs like monoclonal antibodies, including the so-called ""Cabilly patents"" that reaped billions of dollars in royalties over the years for the Swiss company before finally expiring https://reut.rs/3h23gtj three years ago. 
Roche on Tuesday said it has a policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

Since it discovered what it alleges is an overpayment, Novartis said it has been trying to get Roche to return the money, to no avail. 
""Genentech has been unjustly enriched at Novartis’s expense,"" Novartis lawyers wrote.

The analyst believes the company is undervalued and an under-appreciated global leader.
Herbalife is now a global leader in weight management nutritional supplements through a community-based approach and has reached consumers across income levels, according to Sinderen.
He expects Herbalife’s large legacy weight management category to continue profitable growth as high global obesity rates persist. At the same time, increasing focus on healthy lifestyles will drive newer categories, he argued in the report.
Herbalife was at the center of a long-running battle between billionaire investors Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who held long and short positions, respectively, for several years.

However, given the stock’s relative overvaluation and relatively lower growth potential, athletic apparel and footwear manufacturer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) seems to be a better investment bet. So, let’s take a closer look.
Renowned footwear and athletic apparel manufacturer  Nike , Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported stellar earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter on June 24, reflecting an impressive recovery from last year’s pandemic-driven lows. NKE’s revenues increased 96% year-over-year to $12.30 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, ended May 31. Its net income and EPS came in at $1.50 billion and $0.93, respectively, demonstrating a substantial improvement from negative year-ago values. The stock of the Beaverton, Ore., concern jumped more than 12% in after-hours trading on the day of its results release. However, we think NKE is significantly overvalued. Its respective 4.79 and 29.96 forward Price/Sales and Price/Cash Flow ratios compare poorly with 1.34 and 14.17 industry averages.
Meanwhile, footwear and accessories manufacturer Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) has emerged as one of NKE’s major competitors, with impressive growth potential. The New York City company's revenues increased 83.1% year-over-year to $2.15 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended May 1. Its net income and EPS improved significantly from negative year-ago values to $202 million and $1.93, respectively. FL’s shares have gained 50.1% year-to-date, while NKE returned 7.7% over this period. And in terms of their past year performance, FL is the clear winner with 108.2% gains versus NKE’s 55.4% returns.
Analysts expect NKE’s revenue and EPS to increase 11.6% and 19.1%, respectively, year-over-year in the current year. FL revenues and EPS, in comparison, are expected to improve 13.5% and 101.8%, respectively, in the current year. We think FL’s impressive growth trajectory NKE’s makes it well positioned to deliver relatively higher returns in the near term.

 Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN), U.S.’ largest home builder by revenue, rose 2% and so did PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM).  Toll Brothers  Inc (NYSE:TOL) climbed 1.5%.
D.R. Horton Inc (SA:D1HI34),  NVR Inc  (NYSE:NVR) and Taylor Morrison (NYSE:TMHC) were up 1% each. Tri Pointe (NYSE:TPH) gained short of 1%.
Nationally, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values climbed 14.6% from a year earlier, the biggest gain in data going back to 1988. That came after 13.2% increase in March, and was the 11th straight month that price gains accelerated.
Home prices in 20 U.S. cities jumped 14.9%, beating the median estimate in a survey of Bloomberg economists and was the biggest gain since 2005. Low mortgage rates and demand for properties in the suburbs have fueled the U.S. housing market for more than a year, with a shortage of homes to buy helping to push prices higher.
Many buyers are running into issues while looking for properties they can afford. Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell for a fourth straight month in May, according to Bloomberg.

This has accelerated the need for organizations (and individuals) to maintain sophisticated cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information and create secure digital environments. Predicated on this trend, we think that the demand for cyber safety solutions offered by  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT) and NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) should continue to surge. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT) and NortonLifeLock Inc. (NLOK) in Mountain View, Calif. are two of the most prominent integrated and automated cyber safety solutions providers, operating in the United States, Europe and internationally. FTNT provides FortiSwitch, FortiAnalyzer, FortiToken and FortiAuthenticator and various other security and networking functions and anti-spam solutions. NLOK offers Norton Secure VPN solution, Norton 360, Privacy Monitor Assistant and LifeLock identity theft protection solution to its customers.
As the administrative paradigm shift toward digitization continues worldwide , the importance of strong authentication methods and cloud-based cybersecurity solutions has increased substantially in recent years. In fact, an increased reliance on remote servers and web-based applications has heightened the risk of cyberattacks and cloud vulnerability. As such, it is no surprise that organizations and government agencies are now prioritizing advanced cybersecurity measures for protection against ransomware attacks and malicious hacking. We believe that this need should continue propelling the demand for cyber safety and security solutions offered by FTNT and NLOK.
FTNT has gained 66.3% so far this year, while NLOK has returned 30.1% over the same period. Also, in terms of past three months’ performance, FTNT is the clear winner with 35.2% gains versus NLOK’s 25.1% returns. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Capri, which also owns luxury brands Versace and Jimmy Choo, is benefiting from a bump in online sales as consumers with record savings are splurging on handbags and shoes. 
""As the world reopens, we are pleased to be seeing better than expected performance from all three of our iconic fashion luxury houses,"" Chief Executive Officer John Idol said. 
Bigger rivals LVMH, Hermes and Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have also benefited, with traditionally reluctant luxury product sellers investing heavily to build their online presence.

Capri expects annual revenue of about $5.15 billion, compared to previous forecast of about $5.10 billion and adjusted earnings to be between $3.80 and $3.90 per share, from $3.70 to $3.80 earlier.
Analysts are projecting revenue of $5.15 billion for the year started April and earnings of $3.87 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Employees also protested in around 30 cities across Spain at the layoff plans, a spokesperson for Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) said, after Caixabank presented its latest offer to unions.
Caixabank said in April after it bought Bankia that it was planning to cut 8,291 jobs, one of the largest such culls in Spain, to adapt to clients moving online.
It has now offered to reduce that to 6,750, from 6,950 a week ago, while also improving compensation for those who leave the bank, Caixabank said in a statement.
Reaching an agreement with the unions is a key aspect of the Bankia deal, which is underpinned by annual cost savings of 770 million euros ($916 million) by 2023. 
The CCOO wants any cuts to be made through voluntary redundancy and says layoffs should be limited to 6,300.
It is also calling for greater financial compensation.
The CCOO spokesperson said it was still too early to give an assessment of the bank's latest offer as talks, which had been expected to conclude on Tuesday, were ongoing.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Workers at Malaysian palm oil company IOI Corp are mistreated by managers, face poor living conditions and pay high recruitment fees, according to a report to be published on Wednesday by human rights group Finnwatch.
IOI said it would comment on the report after its public release and directed Reuters to a ""grievance tracker"" on its website where it addressed the specific complaints raised by Finnwatch. 
IOI faces the accusations days after saying it will assist in any investigation after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a letter to an activist that it was investigating the firm over forced labour allegations.
Similar U.S. investigations have in the past led to some Malaysian companies, including two palm oil producers, being banned from selling their products in the United States.
Helsinki-based Finnwatch said it found IOI estate workers from India paid up to 45,000 rupees ($606.31) in recruitment fees, lived in poor housing conditions and were not given copies of their employment contracts. It also criticised its wage policy.
""The case also brought into light serious, persisting gaps in the IOI Group's wider recruitment and wage policies, and commitment to respect for human rights,"" Finnwatch said in the report. 
The findings follow an investigation by Finnwatch at an IOI estate in Pahang state on Malaysia's east coast. It opened an investigation in August 2020 after receiving complaints from a relative of an IOI worker. 
Finnwatch shared the report on the investigation with Reuters ahead of its publication on Wednesday. It has also shared the findings and the full report with IOI, and has engaged with IOI since last August. 
In the 'grievance tracker' on its website, IOI said it had suspended recruitment of workers from recruitment agencies in India after Finnwatch said workers were forced to pay high fees to secure a job. IOI said the fees paid by its workers were illegally collected by unknown actors, cannot be verified and were beyond the firm's jurisdiction.
U.S. CBP SCRUTINY 
Malaysia, the world's second-largest palm oil producer, relies on migrants to produce the edible oil found in products from food to fuel.
The U.S. CBP has banned three Malaysian companies in the last year, including palm oil producers FGV Holdings and Sime Darby Plantations, for allegedly practicing forced labour including abusive working and living conditions.
Both companies have appointed auditors to evaluate their labour practices and said they would engage with the agency to address the concerns raised. 
Following Finnwatch's investigation, IOI said on its website it had demoted an employee for mistreating a worker, and released guidelines on providing basic amenities and verifying work hours.
IOI told Finnwatch that some workers are paid less as they do not reach the set work targets, according to the company's response that is also published in the report.
Finnwatch found that IOI had a complex piece-rate wage policy that it said has led to abuse, errors and some being paid below the minimum wage. 
In its response to Finnwatch, IOI said workers were given decent housing, but conditions deteriorated ""because of a lack of cleanliness by the workers.""

IOI also said it has ordered all estates to give workers a copy of their employment contracts.

LONDON (Reuters) -Private equity firm Bridgepoint plans to list on the London Stock Exchange, raising at least 300 million pounds ($416 million) from new shares to help fund its growth plans and pay down debt, it said on Tuesday.
The decision to list follows a buoyant few years for private markets as more investors turn to them for yield in a world of central bank-suppressed interest rates. 
Private equity deals have risen in Britain this year, prompting questions from some public shareholders and newspapers about whether buyout firms are taking advantage of COVID-19 and Brexit to snap up companies at cut-price valuations. 
Bridgepoint, which focuses on mid-sized deals of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), was formed in 2000 after a management buyout of NatWest's private equity arm. 
The firm's investments include Asia-inspired dining chain Itsu, cycle retailer Wiggle, and Burger King's France and UK outposts.
The company, which manages 27.4 billion euros across a range of private equity and debt funds, aims to have a free-float of at least 25% and expects an over-allotment option of a further 15% of the offer size, it said.
It said it would sell 300 million pounds of new shares as well as see some existing investors sell down their holdings.
The total share sale is likely to raise around 500 million pounds and could value the company at around 2 billion pounds, a source familiar with the deal said. 
JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are joint global co-ordinators on the deal.
Bridgepoint's total operating income was 191.8 million pounds in 2020 and it said ""significant further profitable growth"" was recorded in the first quarter of this fiscal year.
""Over the last 30 years we've built the global leader in middle market growth investing, with strength and depth across two very complementary strategies in private equity and private credit,"" said Bridgepoint's Executive Chair William Jackson.
""Today, Bridgepoint has an increasingly global footprint across Europe, North America and Asia. We expect this strong growth to continue in the near and longer-term as we continue to develop our existing strategies and further broaden our platform.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said on Tuesday that it will start selling private-label analog insulin this week at a deep discount to branded insulin vials and pens, as it seeks to drive growth at its healthcare business.
The product, ReliOn NovoLog, is a rapid-acting analog insulin used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. It will require a prescription from a physician. More than two decades ago, Walmart launched a human insulin private label brand called ReliOn that costs $24.99 a vial.
The world's largest retailer said its more than 3 million customers with diabetes could save between 58% and 75% off the cash price of branded analog insulin products, or up to $101 per branded vial or $251 per package of branded FlexPen.
Analog insulin tends to be more effective and easier to administer than the older, human insulin.
About one in 10 Americans have diabetes, or roughly 34 million people. The vast majority have type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition linked to genetics, along with weight gain and inactivity. Diet and exercise can help manage the disease, but some patients also need insulin or other medication.
Alternatively, about 1.2 million people have type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that requires lifelong insulin injections after the pancreas stops producing a sufficient amount.
For years, patients, consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers have complained about the high list prices for insulin and the significant out-of-pocket costs borne by patients. 
Walmart, which is working with pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), said its products were intended for use by patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart has for years strategically lowered consumer prices for generic drugs, undercutting branded products sold by other retailers.
    In 2006, Walmart began selling some generic drugs for $4 per monthly prescription - a tactic soon adopted by a number of pharmacy operators.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Groups representing Europe's largest airlines and airports have warned of chaos and hours-long queues unless countries better coordinate the roll-out of the EU's digital COVID-19 certificate and ensure passengers are processed before arriving at airports. 
The European Union's system of digital COVID-19 travel certificates is due to come into force on Thursday, but airports group ACI and airlines representative bodies A4E, IATA and ERA warned in a letter to EU national leaders of a ""worrying patchwork of approaches"" across the continent. 
""As passenger traffic increases in the coming weeks, the risk of chaos at European Airports is real,"" the groups said in the joint letter sent on Monday and seen by Reuters. 
The digital certificates are designed to show, via QR codes, whether passengers are fully vaccinated, have immunity due to recent recovery from COVID-19 or have had a negative test. 
They are designed to be used for travel throughout the EU from July 1, but would require extra checks and the right equipment to read the codes.
The letter said the only way to avoid huge queues and delays during the peak summer season was to implement a system whereby both the vaccination certificate and passenger locator forms are processed remotely before the passenger arrives at the airport.
Checks must only take place in the country of departure and not on arrival and national governments should manage the health data and provide equipment to check the QR codes, the letter said. 
""A high level of fragmentation and differences in the implementation of the DCC ... as well as continued duplication of document checks in several states is alarming,"" it said. 
ACI Europe Director General Olivier Jankovec, one of the signatories, said his airport members were ""getting very concerned"".
""Coping with this increase is going to be an unprecedented challenge"","" he said. The amount of verification still being done manually at airports was making him ""very, very nervous,"" he added. 
The amount of time navigating airports during a journey has doubled to 3 hours from 1-1/2 hours before the pandemic, said IATA's European Vice President Rafael Schvartzman, another signatory. 
If no changes were made and capacity returned to pre-COVID levels, that could theoretically increase to an unacceptable five or even eight hours, he said. 
Ahead of a meeting of European countries on the digital certificate on Tuesday, the European Commission issued guidance for member states that echoed some of the concerns, noting that 10 different combinations of checks were being planned by various countries. 

This risks leading to ""unnecessary duplication of measures and as a consequence to queues and crowding at airports.""
The situation, caused in party by ""national politics"" risks undermining passenger confidence, said A4E managing director Thomas Reynaert.

In one of the most flexible policies offered yet by a big U.S. tech company as the COVID-19 pandemic eases, Uber plans to say that those working in offices need to spend at least 50% of their time there. 
But unlike many other companies the policy does not mean at least three days per week in the office, the source said. Instead, workers can show up five days one week and zero the next.
The plan is a reversal from April when Uber said that from September ""employees can work from home up to two days a week, but with a clear expectation that they also come into the office three days a week.""
When working remotely, employees can be wherever, including at home, with family or even more exotic destinations. They will be encouraged to try working away from their regular home for four weeks a year, the source said.

The company on Tuesday also is expected to say it will begin allowing more employees to work remotely all the time.

Investing.com -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) was higher by 1% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as the company secured a United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) order for 200 planes from its 737 MAX catalog.
While the order will be a few billion dollars in size, such large orders usually come at a significant discount to the list price. Boeing didn’t specify the order size. 
The order includes 150 units of the largest member of the family, the 737-10, and 50 for the airplane that serves the heart of the single-aisle market, the 737-8.
The purchase increases United's order book for the fuel-efficient, single-aisle family to 380 airplanes, including 30 that have been delivered. Today's agreement also includes the purchase of Boeing 737 MAX training simulator data packages to support United's pilot training programs, a note by Boeing said.
Designed and built in Renton, Washington, the 737 MAX family delivers superior efficiency, flexibility and reliability while reducing fuel use and carbon emissions by at least 14% compared to the airplanes it replaces, Boeing claims.
The 737-8 seats up to 189 passengers and can fly 3,550 nautical miles – about 600 miles farther than its predecessor – allowing airlines to offer new and more direct routes for passengers.
The largest model in the family, the 737-10 seats up to 230 passengers in a single-class configuration and can fly up to 3,300 miles. The fuel-efficient jet can cover 99% of single-aisle routes, including routes served by 757s."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening little changed Tuesday, consolidating around record levels, with the major U.S. banks to the fore after announcing significant dividend increases. 
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded just 1 point higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.
The main indices closed largely higher Monday, with the broad-based S&P 500 advancing 0.2%, its third consecutive record close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining nearly 1%, also a new high. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dipped 0.4%.
Trading ranges are expected to be limited this week as investors warily await Friday’s monthly jobs report. This is expected to show that the economy added 675,000 new jobs in June, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.7% from 5.8%.
“Volatility levels are sinking fast again following a brief hiatus around the FOMC meeting,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The recent FOMC meeting suggests the Fed’s trigger-finger will be a little twitchier when it comes to tapering, but unless the NFP figure comes in close to the one million mark, financial markets will probably be set fair for a low volatility summer.”
In corporate news, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) joined the $1 trillion market capitalization club on Monday after a Federal antitrust court case against the social media giant was dismissed. 
However, it’s the banking sector which is likely to be in the spotlight Tuesday, after most of the senior U.S. lenders announced plans to pay an additional $2 billion in dividends in the wake of the Fed’s stress tests results.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) bucked the trend, by not raising its payout to shareholders - at least not yet.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) on Tuesday unveiled its largest ever order for 270 Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets worth more than $30 billion at list prices, a move that was rumored about on Monday.
Economic data centers around the release of the Conference Board's consumer confidence index at 10 AM ET, which is expected to rise to 119 after declining to 117.2 in May.
Crude oil prices weakened Tuesday, with the growth of Covid cases, mainly in the U.K. but also a number of Asian countries, caused by the highly infectious delta strain weighing on sentiment. 
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.4% at $72.60 a barrel, while Brent was down 0.2% at $74.05, after reaching levels not seen since 2018 during last week’s trading.
There was also an element of traders taking some money off the table ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+.

Banks are spending billions of dollars beefing up their European Union operations post-Brexit to avoid disruption to some of their activities. 
Flanked by JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, Macron visited the U.S. bank's trading base in central Paris, focused on European debt trading. It is set to employ 800 people in Paris by 2022, including some at its existing headquarters nearby.
Of those jobs, some 265 already worked in France before Britain's EU exit, including in advisory roles, and 440 trading and sales staff will join by year-end, with some staff relocating from London. The bank will also hire locally, it said in a statement. 
Former investment banker Macron, who came to power in 2017 with an agenda of pro-business reforms and a bid to attract more foreign investment, faces another presidential election in 2022.
Recent local elections provided no clear pointers, with Macron's party failing to score wins on a regional level.
JPMorgan also has big trading hubs in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt, and remains firmly rooted in London too, even if some jobs are migrating. The bank employs some 19,000 people in Britain overall, with over 10,000 in London alone. 

But Paris remains at the vanguard of attempts to relocate clearing of euro derivatives from London to the EU after Britain's ""Big Bang"" liberalisation of financial rules in the 1980s drained EU financial capitals of such activity and staff.
JPMorgan will house the new Paris trading hub in a seven-storey building a stone's throw away from the Louvre museum.

Investing.com -- Shares of cruise operators were trading broadly lower in the premarket on Tuesday as lingering coronavirus concerns weighed.
 Disney  (NYSE:DIS) shares fell after the company delayed its first cruise of the Disney Dream due to inconsistent COVID test results of the crew. The first test sailing, with only crew members on board, was to happen today.
During routine testing last week, 5 of nearly 600 crew on the Dream tested positive. All were vaccinated, asymptomatic and had tested negative earlier. The crew members were tested again the following day and were found negative.
Last Thursday,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) said two guests aboard Adventure of the Seas ship tested positive for Covid-19 during routine testing and were returned home.
Royal Caribbean shares were down 0.4% in premarket.  
Amid continuing setbacks to the industry, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) last week reported $2.03 billion in net losses for the quarter ended May 31, narrower but still big after a $2.38 billion loss in the same quarter a year ago.
Sentiment for the stock was also weakened on fear of value erosion due to the operator announcing on Monday an at-the-market equity offering of up to $500 million.
Carnival share fell 1.4%. Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) was trading weaker by 0.2%

The risk of higher taxes, tighter regulation and potential for faster economic growth in other developed countries has dented the market’s appeal, the strategists led by Wei Li said in a note.
“We see equities in developed markets outside the U.S. as better positioned to capture the economic restart over the tactical horizon, as the powerful restart broadens out,” they wrote. “Potentially higher taxes and more regulations could pose challenges to the strong performance of U.S. stocks.”
The S&P 500 is trading at a record high after surging more than 90% from its March 2020 low, pushing investors to weigh possible risks to the rally and to consider other markets that haven’t gained as much. Stocks in Europe and Japan can win from the current phase of the recovery trade, strategists say, and these parts of the world also face lower risk of additional taxation and more regulation relative to the U.S.
BlackRock strategists say that if the Biden administration manages to impose a 28% corporate tax and a 21% global minimum tax, this would cut earnings per share for the S&P 500 by 7% next year. At the same time, they expect the eventual tax boost to be more moderate.
While U.S. stocks may come under pressure, the strategists still favor the country’s small and medium-cap companies as they’re less likely to be impacted by taxes and regulations aimed at large multinationals.
To be sure, on a six to 12-month horizon BlackRock strategists are overweight U.S. and U.K. equities, neutral euro-area and underweight Japan.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 06:43AM ET</span>",Analysis: When do electric vehicles become cleaner than gasoline cars?,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - You glide silently out of the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) showroom in your sleek new electric Model 3, satisfied you're looking great and doing your bit for the planet.
But keep going - you'll have to drive another 13,500 miles (21,725 km) before you're doing less harm to the environment than a gas-guzzling saloon.
That's the result of a Reuters analysis of data from a model that calculates the lifetime emissions of vehicles, a hotly debated issue that's taking center stage as governments around the world push for greener transport to meet climate targets.
The model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Chicago and includes thousands of parameters from the type metals in an electric vehicle (EV) battery to the amount of aluminium or plastic in a car. 
Argonne's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model is now being used with other tools to help shape policy at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board, the two main regulators of vehicle emissions in the United States.
Jarod Cory Kelly, principal energy systems analyst at Argonne, said making EVs generates more carbon than combustion engine cars, mainly due to the extraction and processing of minerals in EV batteries and production of the power cells.
But estimates as to how big that carbon gap is when a car is first sold and where the ""break-even"" point comes for EVs during their lifetime can vary widely, depending on the assumptions.
Kelly said the payback period then depends on factors such as the size of the EV's battery, the fuel economy of a gasoline car and how the power used to charge an EV is generated.
NORWAY'S A WINNER
Reuters plugged a series of variables into the Argonne model, which had more than 43,000 users as of 2021, to come up with some answers. 
The Tesla 3 scenario above was for driving in the United States, where 23% of electricity comes from coal-fired plants, with a 54 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery and a cathode made of nickel, cobalt and aluminum, among other variables.
It was up against a gasoline-fueled Toyota Corolla weighing 2,955 pounds with a fuel efficiency of 33 miles per gallon. It was assumed both vehicles would travel 173,151 miles during their lifetimes. 
But if the same Tesla was being driven in Norway, which generates almost all its electricity from renewable hydropower, the break-even point would come after just 8,400 miles. 
If the electricity to recharge the EV comes entirely from coal, which generates the majority of the power in countries such as China and Poland, you would have to drive 78,700 miles to reach carbon parity with the Corolla, according to the Reuters analysis of data generated by Argonne's model.
The Reuters analysis showed that the production of a mid-sized EV saloon generates 47 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per mile during the extraction and production process, or more than 8.1 million grams before it reaches the first customer. 
By comparison, a similar gasoline vehicle generates 32 grams per mile, or more than 5.5 million grams.
Michael Wang, senior scientist and director of the Systems Assessment Center at Argonne's Energy Systems division, said EVs then generally emit far less carbon over a 12-year lifespan.
Even in the worst case scenario where an EV is charged only from a coal-fired grid, it would generate an extra 4.1 million grams of carbon a year while a comparable gasoline car would produce over 4.6 million grams, the Reuters analysis showed. 
When are EVs cleaner than gas cars? https://graphics.reuters.com/ELECTRIC-VEHICLES/EMISSIONS/rlgpdrmjmpo/chart.png 
'WELL-TO-WHEEL'
The EPA told Reuters it uses GREET to help evaluate standards for renewable fuel and vehicle greenhouse gases while the California Air Resources Board uses the model to help assess compliance with the state's low-carbon fuel standard.
The EPA said it also used Argonne's GREET to develop an online program that allows U.S. consumers to estimate the emissions from EVs based on the fuels used to generate electric power in their area. https:// The results of the Reuters analysis are similar to those in a life-cycle assessment of electric and combustion-engine vehicles in Europe by research group IHS Markit.  Its ""well-to-wheel"" study showed the typical break-even point in carbon emissions for EVs was about 15,000 to 20,000 miles, depending on the country, according to Vijay Subramanian, IHS Markit's global director of carbon dioxide (CO2) compliance. He said using such an approach showed there were long-term benefits from shifting to electric vehicles. Some are less positive about EVs.  University of Liege researcher Damien Ernst said in 2019 that the typical EV would have to travel nearly 700,000 km before it emitted less CO2 than a comparable gasoline vehicle. He later revised his figures down.  Now, he estimates the break-even point could be between 67,000 km and 151,000 km. Ernst told Reuters he did not plan to change those findings, which were based on a different set of data and assumptions than in Argonne's model. Some other groups also continue to argue that EVs are not necessarily cleaner or greener than fossil-fueled cars. 
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents over 600 companies in the oil industry, states on its website: ""Multiple studies show that, on a life-cycle basis, different automobile powertrains result in similar greenhouse gas emissions."" Argonne National Laboratory is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by the University of Chicago.

Flanked by guards, the two men, who were brought into court handcuffed, bowed deeply to the three judges who will decide their sentence, and asked to be allowed to return to the United States to see family.
""I deeply regret my actions and sincerely apologise for causing difficulties for the judicial system and for the Japanese people,"" the older Taylor said in a quavering voice.
He replied yes when the prosecutor asked whether he believed Ghosn should have stayed in Japan. 
""I've spent more than 400 days in jail and had a lot of time to reflect. I take all responsibility and deeply regret my actions,"" his son Peter said to the judges. 
The two men pleaded guilty this month to charges that in December 2019 they had illegally helped Ghosn escape from Kansai airport in western Japan, hidden in a box aboard a private jet to Lebanon.
Extradited to Japan from the United States in March, they are being detained at the same jail in Tokyo where Ghosn was held, and face up to three years in prison.
Prosecutors said the Taylors received $1.3 million for their services and another $500,000 for legal fees.
The elder Taylor on Tuesday said a cousin of Ghosn, who is his wife's sister-in-law and Peter's godmother, helped persuade him to take the job.
He added that he felt sympathy for Ghosn and his wife Carole after they told him Ghosn could be held in Japan for up to 15 years. 
The couple, he said, told him jumping bail in Japan was not a crime.
His son said he had met Ghosn three times in Tokyo in 2019 before the latter fled, but the two had not specifically discussed the escape plan. He had ""felt used"" by Ghosn, he told the court. 
The Taylors' lawyers in the United States waged a months-long battle against their extradition, arguing that they could not be prosecuted for helping someone jump bail and could face relentless interrogation and torture.
Suspects in Japan are interrogated without their lawyers present and are often denied bail before trial.
Asked by prosecutors if he had been treated badly in Japan, Taylor said the prosecutor who questioned him after his arrest was ""respectable and honourable"".
At the time of his escape, Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he understated his compensation in automaker Nissan's financial statements by 9.3 billion yen ($84 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships.
Ghosn, who denies wrongdoing, is a fugitive in his childhood home of Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive charged with helping Ghosn hide his compensation, is also standing trial in Tokyo. He also denies the charges.

The Taylors next appear in court on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Data provider Quandl, owned by U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Inc, has agreed a deal to distribute a wide range of commodities data compiled by broker Marex, including speculative positioning estimates.
The two groups announced the partnership on Tuesday after a sizzling rally in commodities that has attracted investment funds back to a sector shunned for years. 
The Quandl platform will offer daily Marex reports showing estimated long and short speculative positions in metals, agriculture and other commodities markets.
Exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) release weekly positioning data, but those official reports track only futures, not over-the-counter activity, which Marex includes.
""You've basically got reports that look at a fraction of activity and there's no real way of knowing if that fraction is representative of the whole,"" said Guy Wolf, head of market analytics at Marex.
London-headquartered Marex has been distributing weekly positioning documents to its own clients, but the Quandl platform will provide daily data that customers can incorporate into their own systems. 
Quandl will also distribute other Marex data, such as one that tracks risk premia, and the two will seek to develop new products, they said.
Banks, mainly in the West, have formulated ""risk premia"" products for institutional investors that seek to boost returns using alternative assets such as commodities. 
Commodities markets have rallied this year as economic growth recovered, investors looked for a hedge against rising inflation and metals demand was expected to benefit from a green revolution. 
""If you look at what's happened in commodities markets... this is a particularly advantageous time,"" said Bill Dague, head of alternative data at Nasdaq.

In 2018 Nasdaq acquired Quandl, headquartered in Toronto, which specialises in alternative data it sells to hedge funds, asset managers and other investors.
Marex, one of the world's largest privately-owned commodities brokers, earlier this month cancelled a planned initial public offering in London due to difficult market conditions.

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was trading higher in Tuesday’s premarket trading following a federal judge’s dismissal of the antitrust lawsuits against the company filed by the U.S. government and most states.
The shares looked set to extend the previous day’s 4.2% gains that the judgement brought about, albeit the 0.4% gain in premarket suggested that the stock's near-term momentum has faded somewhat.
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit was “legally insufficient” because it didn’t plead enough allegations to support claims of Facebook exercising a monopoly. According to the judge, FTC’s arguments lacked a metric to calculate FB’s dominant share.  
The judge gave 30 days to the Commission to file an amended lawsuit.
The judge also dismissed a separate case brought by 46 states in its entirety, mostly because the attorneys general waited too long to bring their claims.
The rulings dealt a blow to government efforts to pursue Big Tech giants on allegations they have unlawfully monopolized the marketplace, invading privacy of their subscribers and selling user data for commercial reasons. However, the appointment of Lina Kahn, a vocal and experienced critic of Big Tech, earlier this month to head the FTC has been taken by many as a sign that regulators are likely to keep up, and even intensify, the pressure on the biggest winners of the Internet age."

Having shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic and forced creditors to swap billions of dollars in debt for stock in the slimmed-down airline, Norwegian completed a court-ordered financial restructuring in late May.
To help save Norwegian from collapse, the government in mid-2020 provided the carrier with loan guarantees of 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($350 million) and later with 1.5 billion crowns in a hybrid loan.
But soon after the restructuring, Norwegian began paying out bonuses of some 30 million Norwegian crowns ($3.5 million) combined to managers as a reward for saving the company, business news site E24 reported last week.
""That shows poor judgment,"" Minister of Trade and Industry Iselin Nyboe said in a statement. ""The board and Chief Executive Geir Karlsen have a big job ahead of them in explaining this and rebuilding the reputation of Norwegian.""
Karlsen, who was chief financial officer during the restructuring, was named CEO last week.
Norwegian Air said the payouts had been agreed as a retention bonus amid the financial restructuring to ensure key managers did not leave during a difficult time.
The company had not violated any government loan conditions, its lawyers said in a letter to the ministry.

""The state as lender has ... not borne the costs of the retention bonuses.

In May, less than a month after taking the job, Orcel announced an overhaul of top management, streamlining a structure designed by his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier.
Orcel axed co-heads for the main functions, slashed the number of internal committees to 15-20 from 44 and replaced an executive management committee of 27 top managers with a 15-member committee.
The sources said the bank was pressing on with a reshuffle of senior managers reporting to that 15-strong group executive committee which was expected to be announced to staff in the coming weeks.
A representative for UniCredit decline to comment.
The ex-boss of UBS' investment banking arm brought in some former associates, including Fiona Melrose, ex head of strategy for the investment bank at UBS, who is now in charge of ""Strategy and Optimisation"" at UniCredit.
Sources told Reuters last week another former UBS banker, Giacomo Marino, was set to join Melrose's team, leaving his post at local banking foundation Cariverona, a UniCredit shareholder.

Orcel arrived in mid-April after UniCredit's board fell out with his predecessor over strategy.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group may have cleared a near-term debt hurdle with arrangements for bond payments through next March, but investors are still giving the developer a wide berth as it struggles to downsize and reduce debt.
Evergrande's dollar and yuan bonds maturing in 2025 are trading at discounts of more than 30%, and investors say the early repayment of its last 2021 maturity is far from enough to ease concerns about the firm's ability to service dues.
Those concerns have soared since a leaked document in September showed Evergrande sought government help to avert a cash crunch, as it works to meet Beijing's debt-ratio caps for developers dubbed the ""three red lines"".
""(This repayment) is still not an indication as to whether you'll be able to sufficiently de-lever and continue to repay your debt in the next couple of years,"" said Michel Lowy, founder and chief executive of SC Lowy, a banking and asset management group focused on distressed and high-yield debt.
Evergrande, one of China's largest foreign debt issuers, has seen its shares rise 10% from lows touched last week after it said it would make debt payments out of its own funds.
But bond investors are worried about the company's excessive reliance for financing on commercial bills, which are issued by its projects to suppliers to defer payments for purchases. 
The company's commercial bills payable totalled 205.3 billion yuan ($31.80 billion) in 2020, according to onshore regulatory filings, up more than 25% from a year earlier.
Fellow property developer Greenland Holdings Corp Ltd had bills payable totalling just 25.6 billion yuan at the end of 2020, filings showed.
Evergrande declined to comment for this story, but said on Tuesday that its interest-bearing debt has dropped to around 570 billion yuan. It has said that it aims to achieve all three ""red line"" targets by the end of 2022.
""Whether they were paid or not, it doesn't really matter,"" said Lowy, noting the high cost of such financing and how it showed the firm had no funding alternatives.
Lowy's firm acts as a market maker for Evergrande bonds, but does not hold a ""material"" long or short position.
Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term issuer default ratings of Evergrande and its subsidiaries last week to ""B"" from ""B+"" with a negative outlook, citing factors including ongoing pressure on the company to downsize its business and reduce total debt, and its weakened access to debt capital markets.
The company's access to bank financing has been squeezed since regulators told lenders to stress test their Evergrande exposure. Bond investors have also been lukewarm: Two portfolio managers told Reuters that Evergrande bonds had for some time been blacklisted by their firms over credit risk concerns. 
Yields on Evergrande bonds have jumped. A September 2025 bond last yielded more than 26%, versus 4.18% on similar bonds of developer Country Garden. 
Even investors willing to brave the risks have been seeing unusual levels of market worry. 
Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, said he bought Evergrande bonds one to two months before their May maturity this year after assessing that the company had sufficient liquidity to repay them.
That the bonds were available for sale reflects market fears, he said.

""For normal bonds there is no offer 3-6 months before maturity as investors think there should not be much risk.""

The company had said early this month the debt level would drop below 600 billion yuan by the end of June, achieving one of the three debt ratio caps set by regulators and coming close to its year-end target of 560 billion yuan.
China's most indebted property developer vowed last year to cut its debt by 150 billion yuan annually for three years, targetting to achieve all three caps by end of 2022.
Evergrande has been scrambling for cash as Beijing tackles what it considers excessive borrowing in the real estate development sector with planned new debt-ratio caps dubbed the ""three red lines"".
Last week, Evergrande said it had arranged its own funds of $1.75 billion to repay its $1.5 billion offshore bonds due on Monday, as well as to pay interest on all other dollar bonds.
Investors became increasingly worried about the developer's financing capability when it confirmed earlier this month some of its project companies' commercial paper had not been repaid on time, but it was arranging payments.
In a filing published on Tuesday, supplier Skshu Paint Co said client Evergrande had not repaid 49 million yuan of commercial bill that matured in the first quarter on time as of May 31, as ""individual major property developers faced liquidity difficulties"". 

Responding to Reuters about the late payment, Evergrande said all the related commercial bills to Skshu Paint have now been fully repaid.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 01:26AM ET</span>","Exclusive: SoftBank shrinks robotics business, stops Pepper production - sources","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is slashing jobs at its global robotics business and has stopped producing its Pepper robot, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters, as the conglomerate downgrades its industry ambitions.
Production of the humanoid Pepper, touted as the first robot with ""a heart"", was stopped last year, according to three sources familiar with the matter and the documents. It would be costly to restart production, two of the sources said. 
Built by Foxconn in China, Pepper was meant to help plug labour shortages but struggled to find a global customer base. Only 27,000 were produced, one of the sources said.
The pullback reflects the fading of Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's plan to make SoftBank the leader in the robotics industry, producing human-like machines that could serve customers and babysit kids. 
As part of the retrenchment, SoftBank plans to eliminate about half of its 330 staff positions in France in September, according to four sources and documents, cutting into the historical heart of the business, whose origins lie in SoftBank's 2012 acquisition of French robotics firm Aldebaran. 
Half of the staff has already been cut from smaller sales operations in the United States and Britain, three of the sources said, with employees in Japan redeployed from the robotics business. All the sources declined to be named as they are not permitted to speak to the media.
In France, negotiations on layoffs are ongoing with final numbers not decided, a SoftBank spokesperson said. Staff have also been laid off in the U.S. and UK and redeployed in Japan, the spokesperson said, declining to provide further deals.
SoftBank ""will continue to make significant investments in next-generation robots to serve our customers and partners,"" the French robotics business said in a statement.
The job cuts in France were first reported by French business website Le Journal du Net. The broader restructuring is reported by Reuters for the first time.
CULTURE CLASHES
SoftBank Robotics launched the chest-high Pepper in 2014 and it became the face of the conglomerate, embodying Son's optimistic vision of a technology-powered future as he built his overseas investing operations. 
Behind the scenes, culture clashes between the French business and Tokyo management hurt the robot's development and its sales were impacted by its limited functionality and unreliability, the three sources said. 
SoftBank, which propped up Pepper sales by placing the robot in its mobile phone stores, has shifted focus to products such as cleaning robot Whiz. The French business was increasingly sidelined, the three sources said.
The conglomerate has been selling assets including the majority of its stake in robotics firm Boston Dynamics as Son focuses more on investing through the Vision Fund. 

The 63-year-old billionaire, who made his fortune through selling mobile phones contracts and investing in startups, describes SoftBank as a ""capital provider for the information revolution."" 
SoftBank retains exposure to robotics and automation technology, owning SB Logistics and with stakes in robotics firm Berkshire Grey and warehouse robotics firm AutoStore.

By Takashi Umekawa and Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) -Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shareholders on Tuesday defeated a proposal for the bank to align its business with global targets on climate change, dealing a win for the board over investors pushing for more action on the environment.
Activist investors in Europe and the United States trying to halt climate change have successfully compelled companies to divest their fossil fuel holdings but the tactic has failed in Japan so far. This is the fourth time since 2020 a so-called shareholder climate resolution has been defeated after being brought before a Japanese listed company.
Japanese boards have benefited from the backing of domestic institutional investors that tend to defer to management. 
Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) is Japan's biggest lender and backs numerous coal and fossil fuel projects.
A Mitsubishi UFJ spokesperson confirmed via email that the resolution failed during its annual general meeting, garnering about 23% of the shareholder vote. 
Mitsubishi UFJ's board opposed the resolution saying the ""essential content"" of the proposal ""has already been incorporated into the company's management strategies,"" with a recent carbon neutrality pledge and other policy changes.
Non-governmental organizations Kiko Network and Rainforest Action Network offered the resolution, supported by a number of shareholders, including EOS at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), which focuses on sustainable investing. 
""While we welcome the recent updates to the company's policies and the net zero commitment for 2050, we do not believe these are sufficiently aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" Sachi Suzuki, associated director for engagement at EOS at Federated Hermes, said in an email.

The 2015 Paris Agreement requires countries to curb carbon emissions enough to keep average temperature rises to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial levels to avert the worst effects of climate change.
Mizuho Financial Group was the first Japanese listed company to face a climate resolution, with shareholders last year voting it down. In the last two weeks, Sumitomo and Kansai Electric Power have fended off similar resolutions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ethos Invest plans to raise 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) for what it said would be the world's biggest Sharia-compliant fintech-focused private equity fund, the British asset manager said on Tuesday.
The Ethos Financial Services & Technologies Fund aims to target small and medium-sized firms, including in the UK, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America in the financial services, technology and related sectors.
Seeking companies which align with the principles of Islamic finance, the fund will also tap into the broader and growing market for ethical investments with a particular aim to boost financial inclusion.
""There's a real lack of capital being invested in companies like this,"" Ethos Invest partner Quintan Wiktorowicz told Reuters.
It will focus on companies between $50 million and $200 million in size in areas including banking, asset management, payments and life sciences, using technology including blockchain, robotics and cyber security.
As well as helping companies in Muslim markets with ethical products and services access the broader global market, the fund would also look to help Western firms go the other way, Wiktorowicz said.
""There are a lot of companies, particularly in the West, that are operating in a Sharia-compliant manner, but maybe don't recognise it as such.""
""They have good products and services that would be very appealing to a Muslim customer base, but they really haven't entered those markets in force, even though they could.""
The fund aims to do the first close of its capital raising in four months and complete it within 12 months, Wiktorowicz said.
Islamic finance, which bans interest payments and pure monetary speculation, is a $2.2 trillion global industry, but remains a fragmented sector with uneven implementation of its rules.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings has estimated the industry will grow by 10%-12% over 2021-2022, after growth of 10.6% in 2020 and 17.3% in 2019.
Ethos will work with BMO Global Asset Management's private equity team as investment advisers for the fund, alongside Saudi Arabian investor the Al Inma Investment Company, which will act as partner in the Kingdom and across the Middle East.
Ethos said it plans to launch additional funds across a range of sectors and move into digital banking and wealth management.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A more than 10% surge in growth stocks since the start of the quarter is fueling a comeback in star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK funds, which posted some of the worst declines among all U.S. equity funds over the first three months of the year. 
The ARK Innovation fund, which is managed by firm founder Wood, gained 3.5% on Monday and is now up 4.3% for the year to date, highlighting a nearly 31% comeback since hitting its May 13 low. Prior to its recent rally, the fund had been down by as much as 9% for the year. 
Driving the gains are declining fears of runaway inflation and the failure of U.S. bond yields to follow through on their dramatic first-quarter rally, accelerating a rotation back in to the sort of hyper-growth stocks that helped Wood post the best returns of all actively managed mutual fund managers in 2020 tracked by Morningstar.
Monday's move was also helped by breakthroughs in gene editing announced on Saturday which boosted the shares of several biotech companies Wood's firm holds in several of its funds, including its flagship Ark Innovation fund.
""Investors have been rewarded for staying loyal to ARK and their long-term growth strategies as fears of rising interest rates were diminished,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. ""ARKK has significantly outperformed the broader market in the past month and is now in the black after being down double digits.""
Among Wood's holdings are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), which is up 22.1% since its March low, and Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) Inc, which rallied more than 50% on Monday after posting positive interim data over the weekend from its ongoing early-stage trial for its genome editing candidate, NTLA-2001. 
Overall, the Russell 1000 Growth index is up 11.4% since the start of the quarter, nearly triple the 4.6% gain in the Russell 1000 Value index over the same time. Those gains have come as the price of lumber and other commodities has fallen from multi-year peaks, helping ease investor concerns over spiking inflation. 
The Federal Reserve took many investors by surprise with a more hawkish turn at its most recent policy meeting, sending the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury below 1.5% on expectations that the central bank would be less tolerant of rising inflation. That has helped bolster tech and growth stocks, as rising yields threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.
Despite ARK's recent gains, the performance of its flagship fund remains in the bottom 100th percentile among U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data. 
Whether the fund continues its recent hot streak will largely depend on the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.

""There's a high correlation between the 10-year and whether it's growth or value overall,"" as lower yields eat in to the profits of cyclical stocks such as financials, he said. While growth stocks are outperforming now, Paulsen remains skeptical the rally will continue. 
""Growth is going to be really strong in the economy this year and next and I don't think we have seen the last of the inflation scare,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has sent the United States a letter that formally kicks off a joint negotiation to resolve a U.S. complaint over a disputed contract vote at a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) factory, Mexican officials said on Monday. 
Workers had voted in April on whether to keep their current contract, however, halfway through Mexican officials detected ""serious irregularities"", including destroyed ballots and scrapped the vote. 
The findings prompted the United States to ask Mexico to review the case for possible rights violations under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Mexico's labor ministry said last week that the union at the plant, which employs about 6,000 people in the central city of Silao, must hold a new vote before Aug. 20 or lose the contract altogether.
The letter to the United States - marks the next step in the formal USMCA complaint process - reiterated those terms, the labor ministry told Reuters. 
The economy ministry confirmed that the letter had been sent.
It also stated that the goal of the remediation would be to ensure that the majority of workers at the GM Silao plant will be able to vote freely and without intimidation, the labor ministry said. 
The labor ministry declined to share the original letter.
Both the U.S. and Mexican governments will have at least 10 days to come to an agreement on the remediation plan.
Labor remedies under the USMCA include revoking tariff-free access for the violating factory's goods.
In GM's case, that could mean applying a 25% U.S. pickup truck import tariff on Silao-made trucks, a move that could add thousands of dollars to each vehicle's cost.

GM has previously said it will cooperate with both governments and that it condemned violations of labor rights including actions to restrict collective bargaining.
The so-called request for review marks the first use of the Rapid Response Labor Mechanism in USMCA, which allows countries to target labor rights violations at specific factories.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.87% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day saying that retail sales grew a better-than-expected 8.9% year-on-year in May. Separate employment data said that the  jobs/application ratio was 1.09 and the unemployment rate was 3% in May.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.37%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.73%. Perth became the third Australian city to impose a lockdown, following Sydney and Darwin, thanks to the latest COVID-19 outbreak involving the Delta variant.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.70% and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.05%. The country will release its manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes on Wednesday, followed by President Xi Jinping’s speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party a day later.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.47%. The market reopened for Monday’s afternoon session after being shut in the morning. The city also said that it would ban flights from the “extremely high risk” U.K. due to the latter's latest COVID-19 outbreak that also involving the Delta variant.
However, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains confident that the country would be able to fully re-open in July as planned.
Global shares are set to end the second quarter of 2021 with a fifth consecutive quarterly advance as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts continue globally. However, the debate over elevated valuations reignited as concerns continue to mount over whether price pressures will lead central banks to start asset tapering sooner than expected.
Some countries' economic recovery from COVID-19 also drove the reflation trade. However, recovery in other countries, including those in Asia, has been slower than expected.
“The Delta variant has also emerged in our client conversations as a potential threat to reflation/inflation,” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Marko Kolanovic said in a note.
“The economic consequences are likely to be limited given progress on vaccinations across developed market economies. It could, however, pose some risk of a delay in the recovery in countries where vaccination rates remain lower,” the note added.
Other investors said, however, that the reflation trade is far from over.
The recovery is “starting in the U.S. and then spreading around the world... the reflation trade is taking a bit of a pause, but it doesn’t mean it’s over,” Advisors Capital Management partner and portfolio manager JoAnne Feeney told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will meet in Paris on Wednesday, where it will finalize a proposal to overhaul global minimum corporate taxation. Elsewhere in the continent, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is scheduled to speak on Friday.
Investors also await the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, for June, also due on Friday."

Enbridge said in a statement that as part of a larger $1.5 billion financing, it issued a $1 billion 12-year term senior note, integrating emissions and inclusion goals into the financing terms.
The energy infrastructure firm said it also closed a 30-year $500 million term senior note issuance with a coupon of 3.4%. 
The SLB carries a coupon of 2.5%, Enbridge said, adding that the proceeds from the issuance will be used mainly to repay existing indebtedness, partially fund capital projects. 

The Calgary, Alberta-based company had published a framework of the SLB a few weeks ago that laid out the principles for bond issuance and performance indicators that impact its borrowing costs. https:// Enbridge has been under the scanner of environmental campaigners as they have argued for years that there is a risk its Line 5 oil pipeline in Michigan, built in 1953, could rupture in the Straits of Mackinac.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 09:01PM ET</span>","Goldman, Blankfein, Cohn must face shareholder lawsuit over 1MDB scandal","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and two former top executives were ordered by a U.S. judge on Monday to face a lawsuit accusing them of misleading shareholders about the bank's work for 1MDB, a Malaysian fund that became embroiled in a corruption scandal.
U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan said shareholders in the proposed class action adequately alleged that several statements by Goldman, former Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and former Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn about 1MDB and Goldman's ethics were false and misleading.
Shareholders led by Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden claimed that Goldman's market value fell by billions of dollars as the truth about its 1MDB dealings became public.
Goldman spokesperson Maeve DuVally declined to comment. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The shareholders' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Broderick's decision followed Goldman's agreement last Oct. 22 to pay $2.9 billion in penalties and have a Malaysian unit admit criminal wrongdoing to settle 1MDB probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities.
Goldman helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, a sovereign wealth fund that former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak launched to promote economic development, and collected an estimated $600 million of fees.
Authorities have said that fund officials and accomplices looted bond proceeds for luxuries and to finance Hollywood films, while Goldman bankers bribed officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business.
Broderick said it ""strains credulity"" for Goldman to contend it had no indication that funds were being siphoned, and said shareholders could sue over the bank's claim it was ""dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us.""
He also said shareholders could try to prove Blankfein ignored internal warnings about 1MDB before telling a journalist in November 2018 that he had been ""not aware"" of red flags.

Broderick also dismissed all claims against Harvey Schwartz, who became Goldman's co-COO after Cohn left.
The case is Sjunde AP-Fonden v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-12084.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>",Facebook hits $1 trillion value after judge rejects antitrust complaints,"By Diane Bartz and Elizabeth Culliford
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday dismissed federal and state antitrust complaints against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) that sought to force the social media company to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, saying the federal complaint was ""legally insufficient.""
Facebook shares rose more than 4% after the ruling. The share price rise put Facebook's market capitalization over $1 trillion for the first time.
The dismissal was the first big blow to state and federal lawsuits against Big Tech firms last year seeking to rein in alleged abuses of their massive market power.
Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said the FTC failed to show that Facebook had monopoly power in the social-networking market but said the FTC could file a new complaint by July 29.
He also dismissed a lawsuit by multiple U.S. states, saying they waited too long to challenge the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 respectively. The judge did not invite the states to refile their complaint.
A spokesperson for the New York Attorney General’s office said it was ""considering our legal options."" 
Facebook had asked for the lawsuits to be dismissed.
Regarding the FTC lawsuit, the judge wrote: ""Although the court does not agree with all of Facebook's contentions here, it ultimately concurs that the agency's complaint is legally insufficient and must therefore be dismissed.""
A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that today’s decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints filed against Facebook."" An FTC spokesperson said the agency was ""closely reviewing the opinion and assessing the best option forward.""
A bright spot for the FTC in the opinion was the judge's saying that the agency was ""on firmer ground in scrutinizing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as the court rejects Facebook's argument that the FTC lacks authority to seek injunctive relief against those purchases.""
The FTC and a big group of states filed separate lawsuits last year that accused Facebook of breaking antitrust law to keep smaller competitors at bay by snapping up rivals, such as Instagram for $1 billion and WhatsApp for $19 billion.
JUDGE FINDS FLAWS IN MARKET SHARE CLAIM
The federal government and states filed a total of five lawsuits against Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google last year following bipartisan outrage over their social media clout in the economy and the political sphere.
The judge said that the FTC did not adequately support its assertion that Facebook has more than 60% of the market. But Boasberg said the agency could potentially fix the issue in a refiling. 

The judge also criticized portions of the FTC's case regarding its refusal to allow interoperability permissions with competing apps.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley criticized the court's decision on the FTC lawsuit as ""deeply disappointing.""

357,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 06:46PM ET</span>",Tech stock rally sends S&P and Nasdaq to record highs,"By Krystal Hu and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit all-time highs on Monday, fueled by tech stocks as investors expect a robust earnings season while interest rates remain low.
Big tech companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp were among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 continued its recent momentum after paring some earlier losses, recording its third record high in a row, after logging its best weekly performance in 20 weeks last Friday. 
In contrast, cyclical sectors dropped sharply amid fears over a spike in COVID-19 cases across Asia. Financials and energy posted the biggest sectoral loss on S&P 500, down by 0.81% and 3.33%, respectively. 
""It's end of the quarter and investors may want to take some profits and rotate out of energy and stick with tech,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
Stovall expects stocks should continue their near-term climb as investors await the new earnings season, in which year-over-year earnings growth of S&P 500 companies is expected to top 60%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 150.57 points, or 0.44%, to close at 34,283.27. The S&P 500 pared earlier losses and advanced from Friday's record high by gaining 9.91 points, or 0.23%, to 4,290.61. The Nasdaq Composite added 140.12 points, or 0.98%, to 14,500.51.
Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit a series of record highs last week. the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 5% gain in June is outpacing its peers as investors pile back in to tech-oriented growth stocks on diminishing worries about runaway inflation.
""We believe with the Fed putting a realistic goal post, investors now have much more of a risk-on mentality going into the second half of the year. A lot of these tech names have underperformed, while fundamentals were very robust going into the June quarter,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, who expects the Nasdaq to hit 16,000 by year-end.
Facebook jumped over 4% as a U.S. judge granted the company's motion to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The social media giant finished Monday with over $1 trillion in market capitalization. 
On the Nasdaq 100, the largest gainer was  Nvidia Corp , which rose 5.0% after major chip makers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Taiwan-based MediaTek endorsed its $40 billion deal to buy UK chip designer Arm.
With the S&P 500 up almost 14% as the first half of 2021 draws to a close, activity in some areas of the market indicates concern over potential volatility, with some investors suggesting the market may be overdue for a significant pullback.
On the economic front, investor attention will be focused on consumer confidence data, a private jobs report and a crucial monthly employment report due later this week. Quarterly results from Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) are also slated for this week.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 31 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.55 billion shares, compared with the 11.17 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The move comes just weeks after Etsy’s acquisition of Depop, a website for buying and selling second-hand clothing popular among Gen Z consumers. Like Depop and Reverb, a music marketplace purchased by Etsy in 2019, Elo7 will continue to be run by its existing leadership as an independent marketplace once the deal is finalized. The companies expect that to happen by the third quarter.  
“Elo7 is the ‘Etsy of Brazil,’ with a purpose and business model similar to our own,” Etsy’s chief executive, Josh Silverman, said in a news release. “This transaction will establish a foothold for us in Latin America, an underpenetrated e-commerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base.” 
Both websites connect buyers and sellers interested in homemade items including accessories, toys and clothing. Founded in 2008, Elo7 has 56,000 active vendors selling to over 1.9 million buyers in Brazil. 

The country has the largest e-commerce market in Latin America based on user numbers according to JP Morgan LLC, which served as exclusive financial adviser to Etsy for the Elo7 purchase.
Shares of  Etsy Inc  rose 5.4% after the announcement.

Given this backdrop, we believe popular work-from-home stocks Zoom (ZM), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), and Slack (WORK) could witness a retreat in the near term. Hence, we think these names are best avoided now.Easing pandemic restrictions and the consequent resumption of economic activities are causing some employees to return to their offices after prolonged remote working.
However, the ongoing digitalization of various industries has made business operations efficient and workers more productive over the past year. So, while enterprises may not be willing to totally return to pre-pandemic work arrangements, thereby sacrificing the benefits of remote working, many are resuming work from office for at least some percentage of their workforce as part of their long-term plans to operate through hybrid working models.
Therefore, popular work-from-home stocks  Zoom Video Communications , Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU), and Slack Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WORK) could retreat in the near-term because of reduced demand for their solutions. So, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

(Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers to complete action on a $52 billion boost in government funding for semiconductor production and research before Congress leaves for its August recess.
The U.S. Senate on June 8 voted 62-38 to approve the funding and to authorize $190 billion intended to boost the country's ability to compete with Chinese technology.
“It's vital, it's necessary and I hope they finish it and I hope they finish it soon – certainly before they break for summer recess in August,"" Raimondo told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""All signals from the House have been positive that they support getting something done in a short period of time.""
A worldwide chips shortage has forced automakers and other industries to cut production this year.
Raimondo said she does not see any significant differences between how House and Senate leaders view the semiconductor funding issue. She said it is still not clear what vehicle Congress will use to approve semiconductor funding, which she described as ""fundamentally vital to national security and economic security.""
Raimondo said she planned to speak soon with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the chips funding.
""I am just going to urge her do whatever needs to be done to get this through her chamber,"" Raimondo said. But she acknowledged the House will ""want to put their stamp on this"" and is not likely simply to approve the Senate bill, called the U.S. Innovation And Competition Act.
Asked if the administration had ruled out using the Defense Production Act to speed chips production, she said the focus was on action by Congress. ""We're going to pursue that path for now,"" she said.
In May, Raimondo said she anticipated the government fundingwould generate ""$150 billion-plus"" in investment in chip production and research - including contributions from state andfederal governments and private-sector firms - and could result in seven to 10 new chip facilities.

She said her department would need to create teams to process and award funds - and noted it would take time to build the plants once money was awarded.
""The lead time is huge,"" Raimondo said. ""The time to get started is yesterday.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets reached new highs for the second straight session, boosted by U.S. equities, while Treasury bond yields eased and the dollar was little changed as investors awaited jobs data that could sway Federal Reserve monetary policy.
MSCI's all country world index, which tracks shares across 50 countries, closed at 722.05, or 0.02% higher. New highs set by the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq offset declines in the major French, German and UK bourses because the global index is U.S.-centric.
Weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and news of a possible bipartisan U.S. infrastructure agreement over the weekend boosted risk appetite on Monday. The infrastructure plan is valued at $1.2 trillion over eight years, of which $579 billion is new spending. 
While less than the White House's initial proposal, the total amount will likely be greater than Republicans' initial figure and may lead Congress to a ""two-bill track,"" which would be a boon for the reflation trade, said Solita Marcelli, UBS global wealth management's chief investment officer for the Americas.
While still near record highs, growing concern about the spread of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus weighed on European stocks on Monday.
Indonesia is battling record-high cases, Malaysia is set to extend a lockdown and Thailand has announced new restrictions.
As measured by the pan-European STOXX 600 index, European stocks closed down an unofficial 0.53%. Germany's DAX fell 0.34%, while France's CAC 40 slid 0.89% and Britain's FTSE 100 index dipped 0.88%.
The region's sectoral index for travel and leisure stocks fell to a one-month low. However, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts do not expect a long-term negative impact.
""While (the Delta variant) might slow the easing of restrictions in some countries...it is unlikely to pose a significant threat to the ongoing recovery,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.56 points, or 0.44%, to 34,282.28, the S&P 500 gained 9.88 points, or 0.23%, to 4,290.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 140.12 points, or 0.98%, to 14,500.51.
Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange S&P/TSX composite index hit an all-time high of 20,273.6 early but later erased those gains, as the energy sector fell 2.5% on the lower price of oil.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 703.61. Australian shares slipped 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's benchmark KOPS were barely changed.
Chinese shares were a touch higher, with the CSI300 index up 0.2%. Data over the weekend showed profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed again in May, as surging raw material prices squeezed margins and pressured factory activity. 
Investors will keep a close eye on official factory activity from China due on Wednesday. The manufacturing reading is expected to slow to 50.7 from 51. The private sector Caixin Manufacturing PMI will follow later in the week.
Oil prices fell 2% to a one-week low after hitting their highest since 2018 earlier in the session, pressured by the spike in COVID-19 cases in Asia ahead of this week's OPEC+ meeting. [O/R]
Brent crude settled down $1.50, or 1.97%, at $74.68 a barrel. U.S. crude was last down $1.12, or 1.51%, at $72.93 per barrel.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs Monday as a rally in Facebook and chip stocks pushed tech higher and offset an oil-led slump in energy ahead of a meeting by major oil producing nations later this week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to another record intraday high of 4,290.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.44%, or 150 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.98% to a record of 14,500.51. 
Tech rallied strongly led by Facebook after a federal court dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against the social media giant. The FTC was seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that could have forced Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, and require that Facebook seek prior notice and approval for future mergers and acquisitions.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed more than 4% higher taking its market cap above $1 trillion for the first time ever. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also ended up.
Tech was also pushed higher by a jump in chip stocks with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leading the charge, jumping 5%. Nvidia reportedly received support for its planned $40 billion takeover of ARM from the latter’s customers including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
Energy slipped more than 3% as oil prices came under pressure ahead of the OPEC meeting Thursday. Major oil producers are expected to decide to increase production by 500,000 barrels per day from August, following the planned production hike by 800,000 barrels per day in July.
”If OPEC+ signals its willingness to produce more oil in the future, the price rally on the oil market should come to an end for the time being,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Financials were one of the biggest decliners on the day following a slump in regional banks as falling bond yields soured investor sentiment on the sector.
People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) led the downside, with the latter lower by 2%.
Lower interest rates hurt the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
In aftermarket hours, bank stocks climbed, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) among the highlights after doubling its quarterly dividend and announcing a new $12 billion stock buyback.
The fall in U.S. government bond yields boosted demand for consumer staples and utilities, commonly used as a bond proxy given the sector’s steady dividends.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), closed 3% lower, dragging the broader industrials sector lower on a CNBC report, citing a letter from a Federal Aviation Administration official to Boeing, suggesting the aircraft maker is unlikely to receive certification for its 777X long-range aircraft until mid-to-late 2023 at the earliest.

Several cruise lines have planned to resume voyages from the United States after many months. Last weekend,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group's Celebrity Edge became the first vessel from a major operator to sail from a U.S. port.
The Disney Dream had been scheduled to set sail on Tuesday. A Disney Cruise Line spokesperson said routine COVID-19 testing came back with positive results for five of nearly 600 crew members.
All of the five were asymptomatic, had been vaccinated and had tested negative ""several times before,"" the spokesperson said. They were tested the day after the positive result, by the same lab, and found to be negative, the spokesperson said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treats the results as positive, which prompted the cancellation of the test cruise, Disney said. The company did not say when a new sailing would be scheduled.
Royal Caribbean executive Michael Bayley last week said two unvaccinated teenagers had tested positive on its Adventure of the Seas ship, adding that 92% of guests were fully vaccinated.

As such, we think PetroChina Company (OTC:PCCYF) (PTR) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) should be value additions to one’s portfolio considering their strong growth prospects and probable increase in dividend payouts over the long term.Investing in dependable dividend stocks is one of the most popular retirement investment strategies. That’s because in addition to their capital appreciation potential, fundamentally sound dividend stocks ensure a steady stream of income that helps pay expenses during an individual’s retirement. 
Given the relatively low coupons offered by fixed-income investments currently, owing to the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy, many investors are now shifting to equities with substantial dividend payouts and high capital appreciation potential.
Because the rapid macroeconomic recovery should boost the cash flows of most businesses, their dividend payouts should increase or at least remain steady in the future.

371,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",House to Vote on Its Version of U.S.-China Competitiveness Bills,"(Bloomberg) -- The House is set to vote Monday on two bills that may form the core of legislation in the chamber designed to boost U.S. research and development in response to China’s challenge to U.S. economic supremacy.
Consideration of the bills -- one authorizing more funding for the National Science Foundation and the other providing additional money for the Department of Energy -- follows Senate passage of a comprehensive $250 billion measure that included more than $52 billion in incentives and grants for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
While the Senate pulled separate pieces of legislation into a single bill intended to bolster U.S. competitiveness with China, the House is taking a more piecemeal approach. Some lawmakers and industry groups are pressing for the House to include the incentives for chipmakers in whatever package eventually emerges.
“As the legislation advances, we urge Congress to include $52 billion to fund the critical semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing initiatives” included in previous congressional legislation that was never funded, the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement.
The House Science Committee sent both bills to the full House earlier this month. They would authorize $128 billion over five years in combined funding for the National Science Foundation and Energy Department, with $14 billion set aside to help stand up a new agency dedicated to developing technologies to help the U.S. stay ahead of its international rivals -- principally China.
Negotiations Loom
The approach the House is taking is differs from Senate’s bill, known as the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, with a focus more on the core functions of two agencies and a more modest allocation of funds for a new technology directorate that will funnel research money. That means the House and Senate will have to negotiate differences before a final version emerges and gets a vote in both chambers.
“We shouldn’t act rashly,” House Science Committee Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson said during committee debate. “Instead of trying to cover the efforts of our emerging competitors, we should be doubling down on the proven innovation engines we have at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.”
The House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up another bill in the coming days that parallels another part of the Senate legislation.
Representative Frank Lucas, the top Republican on the Science Committee, said in an interview that he expected the final version of the legislation could be agreed upon by a House-Senate conference committee by September or October.
“The two sides are working really well together,” Lucas said. “I’m really kind of optimistic right now.”

The estimates, which feed into S&P's closely-followed sovereign ratings, saw India's growth projection chopped to 9.5% from 11% due to its COVID-19 outbreak, the Philippines' lowered to 6% from 7.9% and Malaysia's downgraded to 4.1% from 6.2%.
In contrast, China's forecast was nudged up to 8.3% from 8%, Brazil's was hoisted to 4.7% from 3.4%, Mexico's to 5.8% from 4.9% while those of South Africa, Poland and Russia were lifted to 4.2%, 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, from 3.6%, 3.4% and 3.3%.
""The top risk facing emerging market economies (EMs) is a slower-than-expected rollout of the vaccines,"" S&P's economists said in new report, adding that the pandemic would only subside once vaccinations ""reach a level consistent with herd immunity"".
In Asia's emerging economies, vaccines are currently being administered at a rate of 0.2 doses per 100 people per day. At this rate, S&P estimated it would take another 23 months for 70% of EM Asia's population to be fully vaccinated.

The second big risk facing emerging economies, it said, was if strong U.S. growth and inflation cause an early tightening of U.S. monetary policy which then pushes up the dollar and makes servicing debt denominated in the U.S. currency more costly.
""While EM policymakers can't control U.S. inflation dynamics and the policy response, they can implement measures to influence domestic growth. In the context of the current pandemic, a key measure is stepping up vaccinations,"" S&P said.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 03:38PM ET</span>",Stretched global supply chain means shortages on summer menus,"By Lisa Baertlein and Hilary Russ
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the United States, it's iced green tea. In South Korea, it's fries. 
At least nine fast-food chains and restaurant companies surveyed by Reuters said some of their locations have been grappling with changing lists of brief shortages of key ingredients and products, as supply bottlenecks plague eateries. 
The list of hard-to-find items has included summertime staples such as wieners and chicken wings, and non-food items like plastic packing material and paper bags.
On June 14 the web site of South Korea's No. 1 fast-food chain, Lotteria, alerted customers that its eateries would substitute cheese sticks for its popular french fries, after snarls in ocean shipping and pandemic-related product inspections spawned an outage. 
French fry shipments to the burger and fried chicken chain were delayed due to a dearth of shipping containers and longer health-related customs checks, a spokesman for Lotteria operator Lotte GRS told Reuters. 
Supply bottlenecks could continue ""well into 2022,"" St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday, with reopenings in the United States followed by Europe and then emerging markets.
The problem is not typically a scarcity of the product itself. Rather, networks of cargo ships, trains and trucks are buckling under the ongoing stress from the pandemic - which also caused facility closures and reduced labor at farms, factories and warehouses and contributed to shortages of everything from meat and cooking oil to plastic and glass packaging.
Similarly, the quick ramp-up of COVID-19 vaccines unleashed a surge in demand for meals at restaurants, ball parks and other venues that caught food producers and suppliers off guard. 
If restaurants run short on core products for long enough, they ""risk disappointing customers in large numbers, and that licenses them to go somewhere else,"" said Barry Friends, a partner at food industry consultant Pentallect.
On Thursday, a Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) franchisee in the southern United States said he received only half of the lettuce he ordered, while a Subway location in New York City was missing roast beef, rotisserie chicken, ketchup and spicy mustard. Some locations of Yum Brands Inc's KFC have occasionally run out of paper bags, one franchisee source said. 
Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), parent of Olive Garden Italian Kitchen, on Thursday cited a ""few spot outages... related to warehouse staffing and driver shortages, not product availability."" A spokesperson declined to say what items were temporarily missing but said the outages were at ""pockets of restaurants, not our system, and we were able to quickly recover.""
Shortages are temporary and vary by market and store, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) said. A Starbucks in Poughkeepsie, New York, said it had been short many different items for months, most recently iced green tea, cinnamon dolce syrup and spinach, feta and egg white wraps.
""We continue to work closely with our supply chain vendors to restock items as soon as possible,"" the company said in a statement. ""We recommend customers use the Starbucks app to check item availability."" 
A Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) location in New Jersey was out of barbacoa and carnitas at lunchtime on Thursday, but another nearby location was not. The company said some spot outages could last a ""a few hours"" but that its network is not having supply problems.
Suzanne Rajczi, CEO of family-owned Ginsberg's Foods in upstate New York, scrambled to fill orders for hot dogs, Canadian bacon and other popular menu items as restaurants, cafeterias and other venues reopened or expanded service with easing COVID-19 restrictions. 
The upheaval affected almost ""every single product we sell,"" said Rajczi, who is seeing sporadic shortfalls as suppliers catch up. 
In the UK, the pandemic and a crackdown on immigration following Brexit contributed to unpredictable supplies of fruits, vegetables and prepared foods in stores and restaurant chains, said Shane Brennan, chief executive at the Cold Chain Federation. 

The return of immigrant workers to their home countries created thousands of unfilled jobs across the supply chain. Restaurant reopenings are amplifying the impact, said Brennan, whose group represents UK companies that move and store refrigerated and frozen goods. 
""We've coped with the panic-buy phase, we've coped with the uncertainties of the lockdown. Now, we're trying to do the job without the people,"" Brennan said.

Investing.com -- Stocks gave back some gains after reaching intraday highs early, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got a late afternoon boost that propelled its market value above the $1 trillion mark.
A federal judge tossed out the government’s antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), ruling the Federal Trade Commissions and states don’t have valid claims.
Facebook surged 3.6% Monday, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite rose 0.9%. The S&P 500 was essentially flat for much of the day but finished up at another record. The blue chips dipped into the red.
Most investors are watching for the government’s jobs report for June, which comes out on Friday. 
Energy slipped more than 3% as oil prices came under pressure ahead of the OPEC meeting Thursday. Major oil producers are expected to decide to increase production starting in August after already planned production hikes in July.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Banks seen hiking payouts
Big banks are expected to announce dividend and buyback plans for the coming year now that the group has comfortably passed the Federal Reserve’s latest round of stress tests. Watch Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) shares on Tuesday. All four are expected to announce their plans beginning after the closing bell tonight.
2. Consumer confidence
Consumer confidence in the U.S. is expected to have strengthened in June with Conference Board's consumer confidence Index seen rising to 119 after declining to 117.2 in May. The number is released Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
3. Oil inventories
Oil inventory data from the industry comes out Tuesday as scheduled after the closing bell. Inventories have fallen in previous weeks -- they were down more than 7 million barrels in the prior week’s report -- and that has been good news for oil investors. The American Petroleum Institute puts the number out at 4:30 PM ET.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 hit fresh record highs Monday as Facebook-inspired rally in tech against an offset an oil-led slump in energy ahead of a meeting by major oil producing nations later this week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to another record intraday high of 4,288.68, above the 4,287.90 earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.52%, or 179 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.92%.
Tech rallied strongly, led by Facebook after a federal court dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against the social media giant.
The FTC was seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that could have forced Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, and require that Facebook seek prior notice and approval for future mergers and acquisitions.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) jumped more than 3%.
Apart Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the green.
Tech was also pushed higher by a jump in chip stocks with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leading the charge, jumping 5% after the chipmaker reportedly received support for its planned $40 billion takeover of ARM from the latter’s customers including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
Energy slipped more than 3% as oil prices came under pressure ahead of the OPEC meeting Thursday. Major oil producers are expected to decide to increase production by 500,000 barrels per day from August, following the planned production hike by 800,000 barrels per day in July.
”If OPEC+ signals its willingness to produce more oil in the future, the price rally on the oil market should come to an end for the time being,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Financials were one of the biggest decliners on the day following a slump in regional banks as falling bond yields soured investor sentiment on the sector.
People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) led the downside, with the latter lower by more than 2%.
Lower interest rates hurt the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
The fall in U.S. government bond yields boosted demand for consumer staples and utilities, commonly used as a bond proxy given the sector’s steady dividends.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), down 3%, dragged the broader industrials sector lower on a CNBC report, citing a letter from a Federal Aviation Administration official to Boeing, suggesting the aircraft maker is unlikely to receive certification for its 777X long-range aircraft until mid-to-late 2023 at the earliest.
The record high in the broader market comes as some warn that stocks are in overbought territory and may face a correction in the near future.
""[W]e remain on guard for another potential cycle of profit taking / consolidation in stocks ahead,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""We still believe such a corrective wave can materialize as we make our way into the 3rd QTR, with October in Q4 traditionally offering up some of the market's most notoriously volatile periods as well,"" Luschini added."
377,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 03:29PM ET</span>",Exclusive-White House order pushes antitrust enforcement throughout U.S. economy -sources,"By Nandita Bose and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House is working on an antitrust executive order that aims to push government agencies to consider how their decisions will impact competition in an industry, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The order goes after corporate monopolies across a broad swath of industries ranging from banking to airlines, one of the sources said.
The drive comes as House lawmakers are moving forward with sweeping antitrust legislation aimed at restraining the power of Big Tech companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and staving off corporate consolidation.
It was not immediately clear how such an order would aid those efforts on Capitol Hill and rein in the power of large tech companies that have thrived for years without much regulation.
One of the sources described the order as ""well developed"" and said it builds on a 2016 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Both sources said it is being worked on by former Obama administration officials who now work for President Joe Biden.
The sources said no decision has been made on when or if the order will be released.
White House spokesperson Emilie Simons did not comment on specific details, but said the president made clear during his campaign that he is committed to increasing competition in the American economy, including by banning noncompete agreements for workers and protecting farmers from abusive practices.
""There is no final decision on any actions at this time,"" she said.
Former president Barack Obama's administration issued a similar order in 2016 that pushed executive branch agencies to promote competition but it failed to move the needle. The Biden order includes details on how specific government agencies should review deals and competition in industries, one of the sources said.
The White House has recently appointed advocates of antitrust reform to key positions. Earlier this month, Biden named Lina Khan, a prominent critic of Big Tech, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
This followed the appointment of Tim Wu, an outspoken critic of Google, Facebook and Amazon, as special assistant to the president on competition policy.
Biden, a Democrat, has yet to name someone to lead the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, and is believed to be considering Jon Sallet and Jonathan Kanter, both of whom are involved in fighting Google.
The push by Democrats to go after the monopoly power of large tech companies is not new. The House antitrust subcommittee last year released a scathing report on the tech industry after a 16-month investigation, declaring that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google engaged in a variety of monopolistic behavior.

Big Tech companies, in particular, face similar challenges to their power around the world, including antitrust investigations in Europe and new legislation in Australia and India to curb their power.
The companies have denied that their business practices hurt competition and consumers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ether investment products and funds posted record outflows in the last week of June, bearing the brunt of negative sentiment on cryptocurrencies, according to data on Monday from digital asset manager CoinShares.
Institutional investors took out $50 million from investment products and funds on ether, the token used for the Ethereum blockchain. Ether suffered outflows for a fourth consecutive week, data showed.
For the month of June, ether has lost roughly 22% of its value against the dollar. On Monday, however, ether was up 5.4% at $2,091.96.
Bitcoin products and funds, meanwhile, suffered a seventh straight week of outflows, totaling $1.3 million. For the year, bitcoin outflows hit about $490 million.
The world's largest cryptocurrency was down 8.4% against the dollar so far in June. Since an all-time high of just under $65,000 hit in mid-April, bitcoin has plunged nearly 46%.
""We expect bitcoin consolidation to continue for the next few weeks until a decisive move takes place,"" said Pankaj Balani, chief executive officer at crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange.
""If the global macro environment deteriorates on account of the decreasing pace of global liquidity, it's expected that bitcoin may break the crucial level of $30,000 and challenge the highs of the previous cycle at $20,00. Until then, bitcoin is likely to be in this range and can set up a classic bull trap above $42,000.""
Overall, crypto investment products saw a fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $44 million. Since mid-May, as negative sentiment spread, net weekly outflows have hit $313 million, or 0.8% of total assets under management.
Sentiment on cryptocurrencies has been crushed amid a crackdown on the sector by China, which banned bitcoin mining activities.
In addition, British and Japanese regulators have independently issued warnings against Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Britain's financial regulator over the weekend said Binance cannot conduct any regulated activity and issued a warning to consumers about the platform.

Japan also issued a similar warning to Binance stating that it has been providing crypto exchange services to Japanese customers without registration.
Crypto assets under management also declined in the latest week to about $38 billion. At the end of April, that AUM was at $65 billion.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 03:16PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer watchdog approves new foreclosure protections, but not blanket ban","By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. consumer watchdog on Monday finalized new protections for homeowners who are struggling to make mortgage payments due to the pandemic, but said foreclosures will be allowed to resume in coming months once those extra protections have been met.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in April proposed, among other measures, a new review process which it said at the time would generally prohibit mortgage servicers from starting a foreclosure until after Dec. 31, 2021.
The agency is trying to prevent a wave of foreclosures as 900,000 homeowners start to exit COVID-19 mortgage holiday or ""forbearance"" programs in coming months.
Reuters reported last week that the agency was due to proceed with the foreclosure rule but was expected to carve out certain groups of borrowers after industry groups said the proposal was too broad and beyond the CFPB's legal remit.
On Monday, CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio told reporters the final rule ""takes a different tact"" from what was originally proposed. It will require that mortgage servicers temporarily undertake additional pre-foreclosure protections, including making a greater effort to reach out to struggling borrowers, but it will give servicers more flexibility, CFPB staff said. 
As of June 14, an estimated 2 million homeowners were in forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Around 900,000 of those are due to expire later this year, real estate industry data provider Black Knight (NYSE:BKI) estimates.
Under the new rule, from Aug. 31, 2021 through Dec. 31, 2021, mortgage servicers may only refer 120-day delinquent accounts for foreclosure provided at least one of three new temporary safeguards has been met: the borrower has been thoroughly evaluated and there are no available options to avoid foreclosure; the property is abandoned; the borrower is unresponsive to servicer outreach.
The rule will also allow mortgage servicers to offer streamlined loan modifications, which cannot increase borrowers payments; it also doesn't require borrowers to submit full paperwork. That flexibility will allow servicers to get borrowers into affordable mortgage payment plans faster, with less paperwork, the CFPB said. 

The new required protections do not apply to non-primary residences, borrowers who were more than 120 days behind on their mortgage before March 1, 2020, and small mortgage services.
Speaking to reporters, CFPB officials said they were focused on preventing a cliff of foreclosures and ensuring an ""orderly transition"" to a normal housing market, but that in some cases foreclosures would resume once the forbearance programs expired.

(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co has taken a 40% stake in Brazilian digital bank C6 Bank, the companies said on Monday, making its retail debut in Latin America's biggest economy.
JPMorgan in January announced plans to expand in retail banking through digital channels, starting in Britain. The U.S. bank has concentrated its activity in Brazil in corporate lending and investment banking.
""We're pleased to partner with C6 and support their growth in Brazil, which has become one of the world's fastest-growing digital banking markets,"" Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), said in a statement. 
Founded in 2019 by former partners at Banco BTG Pactual SA, Latin America's largest independent investment bank, C6 has 7 million clients, according to a statement.
The companies did not disclose the value of the deal or implied valuation of C6. The digital bank was valued at 11.3 billion reais ($2.28 billion) in December, when it raised 1.3 billion reais.
JPMorgan's entrance into Brazilian retail banking follows high-profile departures by other global banks.
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) sold their retail operations in the country in 2015 and 2016, respectively, after struggling to compete with mammoths such as Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA. 
Online banking has since allowed financial institutions to grow without costly branch networks, luring new players to Brazil such as SoftBank Group Corp's, which recently invested in fintech Banco Inter SA.
Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc invested $500 million in Brazilian digital bank Nubank at a valuation of $30 billion.
Both JPMorgan and C6 highlighted Brazilian regulatory reforms, which have fostered competition and allowed digital banks to gain market share. 
Daniel Darahem, senior country officer in Brazil for JPMorgan, said the bank will appoint an undisclosed number of directors to the board of C6.
""Partnering with JPMorgan Chase, a global leader in financial services and a trusted name in retail banking, is a game changer,"" said Marcelo Kalim, C6 CEO and co-founder.
C6 posted a net loss of 607 million reais in 2020, ending the year with 8 billion reais in assets. Kalim said the bank is likely to post a loss again this year, given the emphasis on growth, but is set to reach 10 million clients before year-end.

The bank will use the proceeds to launch two new credit lines: auto loans and home equity. The deal also involved the sale of a stake held by minority shareholders.

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",Rubin Sees ‘Material Risk’ High U.S. Inflation Will Be Enduring,"(Bloomberg) -- Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said there’s a “material risk” that the U.S. could see persistently elevated inflation and urged policy makers to be careful to avoid overheating.
Rubin, who served in the Clinton administration, also said ex-Obama administration adviser Larry Summers has done “a great public service” by ringing alarm bells that the recent spike in prices may fail to dissipate amid trillions of dollars in pandemic-relief spending.
“We have a strong economy,” Rubin said Monday during a virtual Aspen Ideas Festival event. While inflation may be transitory, he said “there’s a material risk of it being enduring.”
“As an investor and as a policy maker, I would have a cautious bias,” Rubin said.
Summers, who succeeded Rubin during the Clinton administration as Treasury chief, has been a vocal proponent this year of the idea that policy makers are risking runaway inflation. He sees prices rising “pretty close” to 5% at the end of this year.

While Summers has indicated that President Joe Biden’s stimulus plans have been too big, Rubin said the spending enacted so far -- specifically the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill -- has been “essential.”
Janet Yellen, the current Treasury secretary, is a leading voice in the Biden administration that inflation will remain “transitory.”
Consumer prices advanced 5% in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2008. Yellen told lawmakers last week that she expected annual inflation to be below that level by the end of 2021. Federal Reserve policy makers are forecasting a separate inflation index to rise 3.4% in the fourth quarter of this year and 2.1% in late 2022.

In addition, the Federal Reserve’s reaffirmation that it will leave interest rates unchanged for a long period makes the environment favorable for tech companies Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Cannon (CAJ). So, we think these two stocks could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now.While the tech industry had a bumpy ride earlier this year, with investors rotating away from expensive tech stocks to quality cyclical stocks, continued digital transformation, and the central bank’s decision to not raise interest rates too quickly on inflation fears alone should enable the prices of tech stocks to climb to fresh highs this year.
As the reliance by individuals and businesses on technology continues to grow, tech companies are broadening their bases and increasing their offerings to exploit the opportunity. With expenditure on computers, video games, networking, cloud computing services, and digital advertising increasing dramatically, the tech industry is well positioned to keep growing.
Considering this solid backdrop, we think fundamentally sound technology stocks Nokia Corporation (NOK) and Canon Inc. (CAJ) are well positioned to deliver significant returns going forward.

His investment strategy involves betting on undervalued stocks that possess attractive long-term growth potential. Moody’s (MC) and DaVita (NYSE:DVA) are currently held in Buffett's investment portfolio, indicating his confidence about the solid long-term growth prospects of these companies. So, what better reason do we need to take a closer look at these names? Read on.Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever, with a net worth of $101.10 billion to prove it. He is currently the world’s sixth richest person, and the fourth richest man in the United States. Known as the “Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Ohama,” Buffett’s investing strategy involves investing in fundamentally sound companies that are trading at cheap valuations. Also, Buffett believes in the “buy-and-hold” strategy, and has, on several occasions, advocated a long-term practical investment approach. 
Class A shares of Buffet’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) (BRK.A), are the most expensive stocks in the world, currently trading at $419,134 per share. In fact, Buffett recently “broke” the Nasdaq system when Berkshire Hathaway’s share prices crossed $421,200 last month.

Investing.com -- Beachbody (NYSE:BODY) jumped more than 7% in its trading debut today, proving that at-home fitness isn’t stuck in the days of the pandemic.
The fitness and nutrition company went public through a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company Forest Road Acquisition Corp., and Myx Fitness Holdings, a Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) rival. Like the popular maker of stationary bikes and streaming exercise videos, Beachbody is aiming to grow its own at-home audience of wellness enthusiasts even though people are free to return to gyms.
""Once you get a taste of that convenience, you don't go back,"" founder and CEO Carl Daikeler said in a phone interview today. ""This is the same company today that we started 22 years ago, it's just on a bigger stage but the objective has literally been to use content and pull no punches in terms of what it takes to get results to help people get healthy and fit at home.""
Daikeler added: ""What 2020 did was provide a catalyst for the premise all along.""Forest's trust account totaled about $300 million, and institutional investors including Fidelity Management & Research and Fertitta Capital committed to a private placement of $225 million to purchase Class A shares of the combined company. Beachbody is expected to have over $420 million of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet, and the transaction implies a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $2.9 billion, or two times 2022 estimated revenue, according to a February statement.
""Because we've never had access to this kind of capital, we get to take our marketing to a new level,"" Daikeler said. Beachbody will also use the funds to expand internationally -- they are already in France and the U.K. -- initially looking at Western Europe. While it won't be a costly expansion, it will likely be complex in coming up with nutrition plans that cater to the tastes of each market, among other challenges. 
Mergers and acquisitions are also on the menu, though the focus at the moment is on offering MYX bikes to the 3.2 million total digital and nutritional subscriptions already out there. 
""That's a business that we've got to maximize, then we can look at the other options,"" Daimler said. 
In the meantime, the company's focused on its newest offering, Beachbody on demand interactive, a live stream workout that will stream from six to eight hours a day that will allow up to 100 subscribers to be in the background with the instructor who can provide live feedback. 
For the three months ended in March, revenue for Beachbody's nutrition program outstripped that from digital subscriptions, with $131 million coming in versus $95 million, though digital revenue soared 52% while nutrition revenue rose 23% from a year earlier, according to a company filing. MYX, meanwhile, sold more than 27,000 bikes in its first year of operation. Its price point of $1,299 is far below the cheapest Peloton bike, valued at $1,895.    
Speaking of which, Daikeler's not afraid of the competition. 
""We're not fighting over the last few people who haven't made a choice. It's far more white space,"" he said. That said, while Peloton's prices limit its audience, ""Beachbody has made its business by serving the mass market.""

We can use the POWR Ratings to identify ‘Strong Buy’ rated stocks such as Best Buy (BBY), Big Five Sporting Goods (BGFV), and  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL).This past earnings season was impressive. Over the past month, 88% of companies have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have beat on the top line. It’s an indication that the economy is robust and that analysts continue to underestimate this recovery.
Approximately 70% of the US economy is driven by consumption. So, it’s not a coincidence that a variety of measures showing the health of the consumer are in good shape. This includes wages, household savings, consumer confidence, and consumer spending. Additionally, the expected improvement in the labor market and positive outlook for growth in the second half will ensure that this positive picture is not temporary.

(Reuters) -E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc has agreed to pay $40 million to North Carolina to settle a lawsuit by the state accusing it of marketing its products to minors.
The settlement, announced on Monday by North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, is the first reached by the company with a state government. The deal also includes restrictions on sales of products that appeal to minors and requires Juul to produce yearly reports demonstrating its compliance.
Stein told a news conference he began investigating Juul after ""hearing from friends about the devastation that this product had visited on kids' lives - addiction, depression, bad grades, switching schools, medical treatment and more.""
In a statement, Juul said: ""This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers.""
Juul's e-cigarettes resemble USB flash drives and work by vaporizing a nicotine-laced liquid. In its 2019 lawsuit, North Carolina said the company downplayed the potential harm its products can cause, fueling an ""epidemic"" of vaping among minors.

Under pressure from regulators, the company had already pulled popular flavors such as mango and cucumber from retail store shelves and shut down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Juul, in which Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) took a 35 percent stake in 2018, still faces more than 2,000 lawsuits over its e-cigarette marketing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission in March asked it and other e-cigarette makers to hand over sales and advertising data.

Investing.com – Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rose more than 7% during Monday’s trading as two research houses sent out positive reports ahead of the retailer’s June 30 first quarter earnings announcement.
Baird analyst Peter Benedict believes the upcoming results appear biased to the upside based on robust sector demand and normal earnings seasonality.
The analyst said he is on the lookout to reengage with this ""intriguing multi-year turnaround story,"" even as he maintained his neutral rating with a $30 target for the stock, a level breached in today’s rally. Bed Bath spent a brief time as a meme stock.
Another research firm, CFRA, said it believes the retailer’s turnaround scheme makes it worthy for even more traditional investors and said it sees a 40% rally in the stock price. 
Wednesday, Bed Bath said it will launch three new private-label brands, part of 10 such brands the store plans to offer. Private-labels are in-house exclusive brands that bring superior profit margins compared to those made by other manufacturers and sold by retailers.
For the first quarter, the company expects net sales to increase by over 40% versus the prior year period. Net sales for the first quarter ended May 30, 2020, were $1.30 billion.
It expects adjusted first quarter gross margin to be in the 34% range and expects to deliver between $80 million and $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
For fiscal 2021, Bed Bath has guided for net sales and adjusted earnings of between $8 billion and $8.2 billion and between $500 million and $525 million, respectively."

These 3 Infrastructure Stocks are a Better Buy,"With China intensifying its crackdown on cryptocurrencies, and several other countries planning to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin’s prospects look bleak. However, considering the increasing economic activities globally, and President Biden’s infrastructure plan, we think that investing in infrastructure-related companies CEMEX (CX), Owens (OC), and L.B. Foster (FSTR) could generate significant returns in the near term. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Cryptocurrency Dogecoin has had a skyrocketing rally since the beginning of this year and hit its all-time high of $0.74 in early May, driven primarily by social media hype--with even Elon Musk using his ""Saturday Night Live"" performance to pump the token. However, Dogecoin has plunged close to 60% since its high in May. China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies, given its alleged connection to money laundering activities and concerns over high energy consumption, is believed to have primarily driven this plunge. With China intensifying its crackdown and several countries planning to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is expected to witness further declines.
But while Dogecoin's prospects look bleak, the infrastructure sector is witnessing a solid revival with the reopening of economic activities. Moreover, a bipartisan agreement on a $973 billion infrastructure spending bill should bode well for infrastructure companies. Investors’ interest in the infrastructure space is evident in iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF’s (IFRA) 20% returns over the past six months versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 15.6% gains.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally-strong infrastructure companies CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (CX),  Owens Corning  (NYSE:OC), and L.B. Foster Company (FSTR) that look well positioned to benefit from the industry tailwinds.

ABB (ABB) and Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) bear this characteristic and could be solid picks given their upward trajectory over the past few months and their sufficient fundamental strength to maintain it. Read on.Even though economic activities are returning to pre-pandemic levels in some of the major economies thanks to their robust coronavirus vaccination drives and supportive fiscal and monetary policies, the stock market remains volatile. This is primarily because the Fed has signaled two interest rate hikes by late 2023, a year earlier than anticipated.
With several stocks currently trading at sky-high valuations, and with rising inflation becoming a major concern, we believe turning to momentum investing could be rewarding for investors because stocks that have managed to gain momentum over the past few months might be able to maintain the same in the near-term irrespective of any short-term fluctuations in the broader market. Investors’ increasing interest in momentum stocks is evident in the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) 2.7% returns over the past month compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.7% gains.
ABB Ltd (ABB) and Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ) have witnessed decent momentum over the past few months and we think their fundamental strength should allow them to continue rallying. So, it could be wise to scoop up these two stocks now.

LONDON (Reuters) - A third shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine produces a strong immune response, researchers said on Monday, adding there was not yet evidence that such shots were needed, especially given shortages in some countries.
The Oxford University study found that a third dose of the vaccine increases antibody and T-cell immune responses, while the second dose can be delayed up to 45 weeks and also lead to an enhanced immune response.
The British government has said it is looking at plans for an autumn vaccine booster campaign, with three-fifths of adults already having received both doses of a COVID vaccine.
Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that evidence that the vaccine protects against current variants for a sustained period of time meant that such a booster may not be needed.
""We do have to be in a position where we could boost if it turned out that was necessary ... (but) we don't have any evidence that that is required,"" he told reporters.
""At this point with a high level of protection in the UK population and no evidence of that being lost, to give third doses now in the UK whilst other countries have zero doses is not acceptable."" 
Studies had previously shown that the shot, invented at Oxford University and licensed to AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has higher efficacy when the second dose is delayed to 12 weeks instead of four weeks. 
Monday's research was released in a preprint, and looked at 30 participants who received a late second dose and 90 who received a third dose, all of whom were under 55.

It helps assuage concerns that viral vector COVID vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), may lose their potency if annual inoculations are needed due to the risk that the body produces an immune response against the vectors that deliver the vaccine's genetic information.
""There had been some concerns that we would not be able to use this vaccine in a booster vaccination regime, and that's certainly not what the data is suggesting,"" study author Teresa Lambe of Oxford's Jenner Institute told Reuters.

Elo7 is a marketplace for handmade and unique items and includes items from over 40 retail categories such as wedding, baby, home decor, and children's parties.

LONDON (Reuters) - A former top Dechert lawyer on Monday dismissed as ""bonkers"" allegations he had conspired not to tell mining company ENRC, his former client, that the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) wanted to compel a senior employee to attend an interview.
Neil Gerrard, accused by ENRC in a London High Court trial of plotting with senior SFO officers to damage his client, milking ENRC for unnecessary fees and leaking privileged material, said it was ridiculous to suggest he and his team had witheld information from ENRC after an SFO meeting in 2012.
""I think it's bonkers,"" he told the court on the first day of an expected six-day cross-examination. ""Complete bonkers.""
Gerrard, hired by ENRC in 2010 to carry out an internal investigation into a whistleblowing report, denied allegations that he had leaked sensitive information or that he ""terrorised"" ENRC by suggesting they could be raided by the authorities.
""Raid procedures or dealing with unannounced visits were, in our view, ... sensible risk management procedures,"" he said. ""It helped clients, it helped advisers.""
Asked whether ENRC was really at risk of a raid, he replied:
""At this stage we had no idea. The client certainly thought they were at risk."" 
The SFO opened an investigation into ENRC in 2013 over allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption surrounding the acquisition of mineral assets in Africa. No charges have been filed against the company or current or former officers.

ENRC, which was co-founded by three billionaire Kazakh businessmen and the Kazakh government, also alleges that the SFO incited and encouraged Gerrard's conduct because it was ""desperate"" to secure a high-profile corporate scalp and accuses the agency of misfeasance in public office.
Gerrard, Dechert and the SFO deny wrongdoing. Former SFO director David Green is expected to testify later in the 11-week trial.

""At the moment, we have about 100 billion roubles ($1.39 billion) in debt (excluding lease payments), while the account balances are quite large. The debt is mostly secured by the account balances,"" Chikhanchin said.
The airline has 24 billion roubles of undrawn loans under state guarantees in reserve, Chikhanchin said.
It has not experienced difficulty financing its activities during the summer but secured liquidity ahead of the traditionally difficult autumn season, he said.
Aeroflot placed exchange-traded bonds amounting to 24.65 billion roubles at a rate of 8.35% in June, having initially planned to raise 15 billion at 9.15%. 
According to Chikhanchin, the total demand for these bonds has reached almost 70 billion roubles.
Part of this debt is loans under state guarantees, he said.
""We are diversifying our borrowing instruments. State-guaranteed loans would have been cheaper, but we decided to use another available instrument,"" he said, adding that the company is targeting an average debt rate of about 7%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hiscox has agreed an arbitration settlement with a group of policyholders over business interruption losses due to the British government's COVID-19 lockdown last year, the Lloyd's of London insurer said on Monday.
Hiscox was one of six of the world's largest commercial insurers to lose a test case in Britain brought on behalf of policymakers by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Britain's highest court said policyholders had a right to payouts from insurers who had argued many business interruption policies did not cover widespread disruption after government efforts to curb the virus from last March.
The judgment did not detail the size of the payments which insurers needed to make. 
Hiscox said in a statement its settlement with the Hiscox Action Group of policyholders was ""in line with the Supreme Court Judgment and the proceedings have now been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties"". 
The terms of the settlement were confidential, it added.
The Hiscox Action Group, which also took part in the test case, issued an identical statement.
Hiscox said in March it had reserved $475 million overall for pandemic-related claims and that the insurer had suffered ""brand damage"" after the high-profile court case.
Its shares rose 2% to a two-month high, outperforming the FTSE mid-cap index.
The judgment affects dozens of insurers with similar policy wordings.
The FCA said earlier this month that 757 million pounds ($1.05 billion) in interim or final payments had been made by insurers to policyholders so far.
Hiscox has accepted nearly 8,000 claims for business interruption payments, the most among around 50 insurers which have accepted claims, according to FCA data. 
The insurer had made interim or final payments on more than 2,000 claims as of May 31, the FCA data showed.
Josianne El Antoury, an associate at law firm Covington, said there was likely to be more litigation in Britain around business interruption payments, on issues not directly addressed by the judgment.

""The FCA test case has been great in terms of providing guidance, but it isn't the be-all and end-all,"" she said.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek (TW:2454) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) are Arm’s first customers to publicly support the takeover, The Sunday Times reported.
Nvidia is awaiting approval from regulators in the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and China for the proposed acquisition.
According to reports, rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have voiced fears that Nvidia could limit the supply of the company’s technology to its competitors or raise prices. Arm offers its designs to more than 500 companies that make their own chips.
A Financial Times report earlier this month said the process may take longer given that Nvidia had requested for approval from the Chinese authorities only recently and that itself could take 18 months.

In fact, with young homeowners turning to renovation rather than buying new homes, the company is expected to continue seeing a surge in demand for its home improvement goods and services. So, we think SWK’s reasonable valuation, despite the company’s solid organic growth prospects, makes it a solid bet now. Let’s discuss.Founded in 1843, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., New Britain, Conn.-based (SWK) is involved in tools and storage, industrial, and electronic security systems worldwide. A vibrant home improvement market with an increased focus by consumers on renovating living spaces and gardens amid the homebound lifestyle forced by the pandemic lockdown mandates enabled SWK to generate 31% organic growth in its last reported quarter.
Strong construction-related demand across all major markets and increased demand for both outdoor and indoor product electrification projects have helped SWK’s stock gain 51.1% over the past year and 14.7% year-to-date. The company has raised its 2021 adjusted EPS outlook to $10.70 - $11.00 from a range of $9.70-$10.30. Also, it expects its organic revenue growth to be in the range of 11-13%.
Amid a strong demand for home remodeling and increased discretionary spending on home improvement projects, we think SWK is well positioned to benefit and achieve record growth this year and beyond.

However, its stock price has retreated 1.6% over the past month to close Friday’s trading session at $28.13. Given the company’s bleak recovery prospects in the near term and the stock’s lofty valuation, is it wise to bet on the stock now? Let’s discuss. Read on.Shares of the world’s largest cruise company, Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL)—which has a fleet of 87 ships that visit more than 700 ports around the world—have advanced 8.8% over the past three months to close Friday’s trading session at $28.13. This is due primarily to investors’ optimism surrounding the company’s plans to resume its guest cruise operations in a phased manner in the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. However, it’s expected to take a long time before the company can operate at full capacity.
Miami-based CCL said it expects to have its full fleet back in operation by spring 2022. It added that its phased resumption of guest cruise operations is expected to continue to have a material impact on all aspects of its business, including liquidity, financial position and operational results. However, it is expected it will take time for CCL to pay off massive debts accumulated amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we think its near-term prospects look bleak.
Furthermore, on June 18 CCL said it had detected unauthorized access to its computer systems in March, affecting the personal information of some guests, employees and crew for Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and medical operations.

(Reuters) - United Airlines was putting the finishing touches on Monday to an airplane order potentially worth $30 billion at list values for up to 270 narrowbody jets in a bid to secure a pandemic recovery at favorable prices, industry sources said.
The order could include up to 200 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo which competes with the top end of the MAX family for single-aisle trips needing most range.
Such a deal would notionally be worth $33 billion at the most recently published list prices, but analysts say airlines typically pay less than half price for deals of this size.
None of the parties commented ahead of an announcement expected at a United investor event on Tuesday. Negotiations are complex and numbers of units can shift, the sources cautioned.
The deal would be the industry's biggest since the coronavirus pandemic pummelled air traffic and airline balance sheets, eclipsing recent orders for more than 100 MAX from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).[
It would accelerate a recovery for the MAX which has been logging orders to rebuild momentum damaged by a safety crisis even before COVID-19. A 2019 draft order for 200 MAX from British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) was never finalised.
However, it would not resolve a strategic stalemate which has seen Airbus dominate the busy market for larger single-aisle jets while Boeing relies heavily on demand for its core MAX 8.
A split order would highlight widespread concerns that the MAX ""can't solve the whole problem"", one industry source said. Airlines also have to consider availability when buying.
Such an announcement ""could mean only two versus three cheers for Boeing"" since the A321neo remains ""Boeing's nemesis at the top end of the narrowbody market with a dominant market share,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote.
United is considered one of the industry's most influential buyers, whose whopping purchases can set the tone for decades.
A shock Airbus win there in 1992 led to the launch of the most-sold generation of Boeing 737, the 737NG. Boeing hit back with a major win for its successor, the 737 MAX, in 2012.
Reuters reported this month that the MAX portion of the latest order could involve as many as 200 aircraft.
The deal would come days after the first flight of the 737 MAX 10, the largest member of the MAX family of which United has 100 on order. 

The MAX 10 was launched in 2017 to strengthen the top end of the portfolio following disappointing sales of the MAX 9, but Boeing continues to lag Airbus in the key long-range niche. 
Boeing is now studying a new model to replace the out-of-production 757, which overlaps with the A321neo and MAX 10, but is not expected to decide before 2023 as it ponders how to produce the pair of jets as cheaply as possible.

“NN Group has made an offer to acquire part of MetLife’s businesses in Europe. In line with our strategy, this is considered an opportunity to consolidate our leading positions in attractive growth markets in which NN is already active,” the Netherlands-based asset manager said in a note Sunday.
NN did not provide details of the offer, but Bloomberg reported it is willing to pay about $740 million for the assets.
New York-based MetLife is seeking to streamline its global business. Its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa reported adjusted earnings of $327 million in 2020, up from $282 million in 2019.
The offer comes as NN, which has been facing pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management to unlock value for shareholders, pursues a sale of its asset management arm, according to Bloomberg.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Qatar Petroleum has hired a group of banks to arrange a four-tranche issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, a document showed, for what will be its debut public bond sale months after it signed a contract to boost its liquefied natural gas output.
The bond sale will comprise conventional tranches of five, 10 and 20 years, as well a 30-year Formosa portion, the document from one of the banks on the deal and reviewed by Reuters showed.
Formosa bonds are sold in Taiwan by foreign borrowers and denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar.
The document did not give any indication on the size of the deal but sources have previously told Reuters the planned debt sale could raise up to $10 billion.
Qatar Petroleum (QP), one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, hired Citi and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to coordinate the issue.
They, along with BofA Securities,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, MUFG, QNB Capital and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), will arrange investor calls starting on Monday.
Fitch Ratings assigned QP a long-term issuer default rating of AA- with a stable outlook on Monday, which it said was ""constrained by that of sole shareholder - Qatar (AA-/Stable) - given strong links between the company and the sovereign"".
""Fitch assesses the Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of QP at 'aa+', which is supported by the large scale of its LNG franchise, low production costs, large reserve base and conservative leverage,"" Fitch said, adding QP operations' focus on gas ""makes it better placed for energy transition than other oil and gas majors.""
QP's fundraising comes as energy companies in the region seek different means to raise cash after they were hurt last year by the double shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil prices collapsing.

QP signed a contract in February for the first phase of its North Field LNG expansion project, which aims to boost Qatar's LNG output by 40% a year by 2026.
Fitch said key constraints on QP's rating include completion risk for large capital expenditure projects related to increasing LNG production, as well as political risk.

Money raised will be used to purchase ordinary shares of Carnival Plc, trading in the United Kingdom, and for general corporate purposes, the company said. 
The cruise operator has raised over $2.5 billion by selling its shares over the past year as travel restrictions due to the pandemic brought its business to a standstill.
With cruises ordered to operate with fewer passengers onboard while following strict hygiene and sanitization protocols, Carnival and others are expected to burn more cash to stay in business.

Investing.com – Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) rose more than 60% Monday after a phase-I study of a gene-editing treatment for a disease called transthyretin amyloidosis showed positive results.
Shares of Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmaceuticals, Intellia's partner in the study, gained 3%. Two other companies working on the same gene-editing technology also rallied in premarket trading, with CRISPR Therapeutics soaring 8% and  Editas Medicine  (NASDAQ:EDIT) rising 16%.
The stock soared because of the wider implications the gene-editing treatment holds and not just for the patients suffering from transthyretin amyloidosis.
The Intellia data showed deep reduction in the disease-causing protein after single infusion of NTLA-2001, an investigational CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis.
NTLA-2001 is the first investigational CRISPR therapy candidate to be administered systemically, or through a vein, to edit genes inside the human body. CRISPR is a Nobel Prize-winning gene-editing technology.
Transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, is a rare, progressive and fatal disease that occurs when a person is born with mutations in the TTR gene.
The mutation causes the liver to produce damaged proteins that then build up to cause serious complications in multiple tissues, including the heart, nerves and digestive system.
There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide living with ATTRv amyloidosis (hereditary ATTR) and between 200,000 and 500,000 people with ATTRwt amyloidosis (wild-type ATTR)."

It plans to use the offering’s proceeds primarily to redeem preferred stock and pay down its revolving credit facility. However, because SNCR is facing intense competition from top players in the software space, the question is, is it wise to bet on the stock now? Let’s find out.
Global software and services company Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:SNCR) solutions are used by more than 200 businesses worldwide, including by the likes of  Verizon Communications  Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (T). Its shares traded higher on June 25 following its pricing of a $100 million public offering of common stock. The company plans to use the offering’s proceeds to redeem its Series A convertible participating perpetual preferred stock and to pay down its revolving credit facility. Its stock price has soared 46.5% since hitting its 52-week low of $2.35 on June 21, 2021.
However, SNCR has lost 24.9% so far this year and 9.5% over the past three months to close Friday’s trading session at $3.53. This can be attributed primarily to its weak financials in the first quarter (ended March 31, 2021) and poor profitability. The company also continues to face intense competition from top players in the software space, such as SAP SE (DE:SAPG) (SAP) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). 
Furthermore, SNCR is currently searching for a new CFO because its current CFO, David Clark, is expected to step down from his role on August 9, 2021. So, SNCR’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading on report the plane manufacturer is not likely to receive certification for its 777X long-range aircraft until mid-to-late 2023 at the earliest.
According to CNBC, the Federal Aviation Administration has informed the company there are numerous technical issues that need to be resolved.
The news overshadowed another report that put the company in contention for a part of the $30 billion order that United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) plans to place for 270 narrow-body jets.
A Reuters report said the order could include up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo, which competes with the longer-range versions of the MAX family.
The report hints at a stricter approach toward Boeing in the approval of new models, in the wake of criticism that the FAA was too easily swayed by Boeing's lobbyists during the certification process for the 737 MAX. Two fatal crashes by that model led to a lengthy grounding and intense scrutiny of relations between the agency and its most important counterparty in commercial aviation.
Adverse developments at its own end and the pandemic have kept Boeing busy for the last two years. Problems from the 737 MAX disaster still ripple through the company.  Just last month, it secured the FAA’s approval for an electrical fix that had kept some 100 planes grounded.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 08:46AM ET</span>",Burberry boss returns to Italy to lead rival Ferragamo,"By Muvija M and Claudia Cristoferi
(Reuters) - Burberry boss Marco Gobbetti is leaving the company to return home and take the helm of Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo, casting a pall over the British fashion brand's revamp.
Gobbetti has been credited with boosting Burberry's market value by a third as he has taken the brand further upmarket. Concern that his departure will undo some of that progress sent its London-listed shares tumbling as much as 10% in early trade while Ferragamo rose 2.3% in Milan. 
Burberry recovered some of those losses to trade down 7.7% at 20.80 pounds. Ferragamo reversed early gains and was down 1.5% down at 19 euros, with one trader citing reduced likelihood of a takeover after Gobbetti's appointment.
""The board and I are naturally disappointed by Marco's decision, but we understand and fully respect his desire to return to Italy after nearly 20 years abroad,"" Burberry Chairman Gerry Murphy said in a statement.
Ferragamo, which became famous for shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn, said Gobbetti would take up his new position once released from his contractual obligations.
Burberry said it will now begin the search for the 62-year-old executive's successor. 
Known for its trench coats and trademark plaid, Burberry's strategy shift under Gobbetti injected fresh life into its ranges, helped by his 2018 recruitment of star designer Riccardo Tisci, a fellow Italian and former colleague at Givenchy. 
'RIGHT TIME'
""With Burberry re-energised and firmly set on a path to strong growth, I feel that now is the right time for me to step down,"" Gobbetti said.
The market, however, appeared less confident in Burberry without Gobbetti.
""This is a negative for Burberry and a source of uncertainty until we get clarity on the new CEO,"" Citi analysts said.
Citi predicted that Gobbetti's key initiatives will remain in place for at least another year and be executed by an interim CEO, possibly finance chief Julie Brown.
They also flagged potential uncertainty over creative director Riccardo Tisci, who had followed Gobbetti to Burberry.
Analysts were also puzzling over Gobbetti's decision to leave Burberry, which is more than three times bigger than Ferragamo by market value, though Hargreaves analyst Susannah Streeter suggested the reason could simply be that he wanted to return home after all the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Even chief executives, with access to first-class travel or private jets are not immune to quarantine rules and travel restrictions,"" she said. 
Speculation over a management shake-up at Ferragamo has been circulating for some time, even after the Ferragamo family that controls the company confirmed current boss Micaela Le Divelec in her role as recently as March.
SALES RECOVERY
In Gobbetti, it has hired an industry veteran who has also led luxury groups Celine, Givenchy and Moschino. He took charge of Burberry in mid-2017 from fashion designer Christopher Bailey, who spent only three years leading the company.
Burberry said in May that sales were recovering from the coronavirus crisis, partly thanks to a rebound in China, but cautioned that profit margins would be dented by higher investment. 
Hargreaves analyst Sophie Lund-Yates had noted that Burberry was set to come out of the pandemic in better shape than it had entered the crisis, helped by its repositioning at the more exclusive end of the luxury chain.
Ferragamo, meanwhile, has been hit harder than most of its rivals during the pandemic and is often cited by industry observers as a possible takeover target, though the Ferragamo family has denied that it wants to sell.

UBS is looking to overturn a 2019 French court ruling in which it was found guilty of soliciting clients illegally at sporting events and parties in France, and of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion.
""We acknowledge this decision. We are awaiting the Sept. 27 ruling with a serene mind,"" UBS lawyer Herve Temime told journalists.
UBS was hit in 2019 with a record 4.5 billion euros in penalties, including a 3.7 billion euro fine and 800 million euros in civil damages.
With its motion on the constitutional aspects of the case, the bank was seeking to argue that it should never have been charged with laundering of tax fraud, which carries higher sanctions than aiding and abetting tax fraud. 
In the fresh appeals trial, prosecutors are still seeking a fine of at least 2 billion euros, with lawyers for the French state saying they wanted 1 billion euros in damages and interest payments.
Lawyers for UBS argued in the appeals trial three months ago that despite whistleblowers coming forward, investigators had never found clear evidence of systematic attempts to canvass French customers by UBS commercial specialists, including at client events such as cocktail parties and hunts.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Analysis: Canadian aero suppliers face labor crunch as travel rebounds,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian aerospace firms are struggling to hire back workers to meet resurgent travel demand in the latest evidence of a post-pandemic labor crunch, industry executives said.
The squeeze has emerged as a warning signal for aviation's recovery internationally and accelerates a shift in the workforce toward fast-growth sectors like electric vehicles, they said.
As suppliers in the aerospace-making hub of Quebec return to hiring mode, several interviewed by Reuters said they feared the exodus of talent could get more acute with an aging workforce and some training programs facing lower enrollment.
""Some companies are growing faster, others slower. But everyone is looking for workers,"" said Suzanne Benoit, president of Quebec aerospace trade group Aéro Montreal.
Canada's flagship business-jet maker Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) is experiencing a ""competitive job market"" as it goes back to recruiting, a spokeswoman said.
Aerospace joins a list of sectors facing challenges to adjust to the sudden revving up of the North American economy. 
In the United States, statistics showing lower employment in manufacturing have raised concerns about supply constraints.
And in Canada, where lockdowns stayed in place longer, economists are predicting a rush of hiring in June.
Demand could push wages up for workers in popular categories like machinists, although some suppliers are also recruiting skilled immigrants from Mexico, Tunisia and Morocco. 
Montreal, the world's third-largest aerospace center, fears a delay in its economic recovery if jobs can't be filled.
""The risk … is that we won’t have enough workers to carry out contracts so we will have to refuse contracts,"" Benoit said.
Nancy Venneman, president of engineering firm Altitude Aerospace Canada, said pressure could pile up further in the fall when customer projects like product upgrades and aircraft modifications delayed by the pandemic return.
Aerospace was one of the world industries worst-hit by the pandemic as traffic plummeted in 2020, grounding fleets. But it has set ambitious plans to restore output in coming years.
Some suppliers for Europe's Airbus have warned they may struggle to meet production goals.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has warned of supply constraints after a “more robust” recovery than expected.
And this week, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) canceled 1% of its July flights amid a labor shortage at some hubs.
Aerospace and defense companies announced 115,089 job cuts for the U.S. market from March 2020 to May 2021, compared with 18,337 announced in 2018 and 2019 combined, according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
SECTOR COMPETITION
Mario Sévigny, co-founder of MSB Group, which produces components for private jetmakers like Bombardier and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream, said it would take six to nine months to meet a potential production increase due to scarce labor. 
While a Canadian program protected some jobs by defraying part of workers' salaries, it didn't cover the entire amount which led to layoffs. Some local employers like a unit of Airbus criticized the level of support from Ottawa.
The Aerospace Industries Association of Canada (AIAC), which accounts for over 95% of aerospace activity in Canada, said more than half its members had to lay off employees.
Aerospace is, meanwhile, competing for young workers with fast-rising industries like electric transport. 
The average age of an aerospace manufacturing worker in Canada is 54, according to AIAC. 
The École nationale d'aérotechnique, Quebec's largest aeronautics college which offers training in fields like aviation maintenance, said registrations in its three-year programs aimed largely at recent high school graduates dropped 20% for the fall 2021 session.
While aerospace has faced previous crises, the duration of COVID-19's impact has driven workers elsewhere, Benoit said.
Some went to transport companies that make electric buses, like fast-growing Lion Electric Co and Nova Bus, a division of Sweden's Volvo Group.

Hugue Meloche, chief executive of components maker Meloche Group which supplies the locally-produced Airbus A220 jet, needs to hire about 70 people a year over five years. 
""We are losing a lot of workers who are going to other sectors that weren't affected by the pandemic,"" he said.

Biogen’s aduhelm became the first drug in 18 years to secure the Food and Drug Administration’s nod for treating the neurodegenerative disease, which has loomed ever larger on health systems around the world as populations have aged.
The drug, which has a list price of $56,000 per year, was approved as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's on June 7.
At $56,000 a year, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that Medicare could spend $57 billion or more per year on Aduhelm, which is more than Medicare Part B spends on all other drugs combined, the House Committee said, according to Reuters.
The FDA approved the drug - despite strong objections from its own expert advisory panel - for all patients with Alzheimer's, although it has only been tested for patients in the early stages of the disease.
Three of the 11 members of FDA's independent advisory panel have resigned in protest over the agency's decision.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -Telecoms bosses toasted the return of Barcelona's Mobile World Congress on Monday with an agenda to put the industry at the centre of digital development and inclusion in a global reboot following the coronavirus pandemic.
Having kept networks humming while people were locked down at home, telecoms executives said the pandemic had shown how vital connectivity was to those with access to the latest technology, and more so for those the billions who lack it.
Cancelled last year at the last minute when COVID-19 first began to spread across the globe, the annual event is being held in a hybrid format with around 30,000 visitors, compared to the more than 100,000 that usually attend, with others online.
""We are back to business, back to Barcelona and back together,"" said Mats Granryd, head of the GSMA industry association that hosts the biggest telecoms get-together at the Catalan capital's sprawling Fira trade fair grounds.
With the acceleration of digitalisation during the coronavirus crisis, cybersecurity and data governance are taking centre stage, the chiefs of Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) and France's Orange said, adding that building trust with consumers was key.
""For too long progress in technology meant only advancement at any cost - but real progress comes when we move towards an equitable future, not when we just make shiny new things,"" Stephane Richard, Orange CEO and GSMA chairman said in a keynote address from the event's main stage.
Saddled with high debt and weak revenues, telcos are hoping to capitalise on the social credit derived from their role connecting societies and individuals during the pandemic to position themselves as the 'good guys'.
""Data cannot be extricated without compensation - it's called digital dignity,"" Telefonica CEO Jose-Maria Alvarez-Pallete said. ""I have a right to know what my data is worth.""
The trio also called for an overhaul of regulation in the European Union, saying fragmentation across the 27-nation bloc put them at a disadvantage against rivals like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s WhatsApp messaging service.
""Connectivity today is needed. But, in 2030, connectivity will be a human right,"" Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said.
With visitors armed with negative COVID-19 tests, FFP2 face masks and a digital contact tracing badge, the industry hopes the event will create a blueprint for the future.
But several big names including Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Samsung (KS:005930) are staying away this year.
""I promise next year that Deutsche Telekom and all of us will be back again in Barcelona,"" said Hoettges, who joined by video link from the company's headquarters in Bonn, Germany.
CYBERSECURITY 
Richard said that a third of European businesses had reported cyber-attacks last year, a potentially fatal occurrence for smaller firms lacking the software to protect themselves.
""Cybersecurity is a constant race... no-one can be protected any longer behind a closed digital wall,"" Richard said, a position echoed across the panel, who suggested next-generation 5G mobile networks were both a solution and risk.

Most telcos are betting big on 5G, with partnerships announced at MWC spanning the cloud, software-as-a-service and traditional mobile and broadband operations.
""In China, 5G is on the fast track of development, with the deployment of nearly 850,000 5G base stations and 330 million 5G cell phone users,"" China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Chairman Yang Jie said via videolink. He predicted that China's digital economy would represent half of its GDP by 2025.

Investing.com – NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) was up more than 2.5% in Monday’s premarket trading on landing a ‘conviction buy’ call from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
While upgrading the stock from ‘buy’, the bank also raised the target price for the power company to $57, an upside of 48% from the stock’s closing on Friday.
The bank expects the company’s retail business and a return to more normal operating conditions after winter storm Uri to drive cash flows in 2022-23.
The retirement of multiple coal plants in Illinois and Delaware will have little impact on the company, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Lapides.
The analyst also sees the power retailer going for share buyback of “just under 25% of its market cap given its strong leverage metrics and cash generation”.
“However, our numbers do not assume the cash inflow and lost EBITDA associated with the announced pending sale of 4.8 GW of fossil power plants,” Lapides said in a note.
NRG is selling 4.8 gigawatts of fossil-fueled power capacity in various regions, including plants in Middletown, Hartford and Milford plants in Connecticut for $760 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global market regulators said on Monday they may mandate the use of planned standards for corporate disclosures about climate change - if they are rigorously drafted.
Earlier this month finance ministers from the G7 rich nations backed the creation of an International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to write ""baseline"" rules for disclosures on how climate change will affect companies' performance.
The ISSB is set to be launched ahead of the UN COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November to inject global consistency and comparability in disclosures.
Investors complain about a patchwork of requirements across the world as jurisdictions like the European Union push ahead with their own rules, and the first set of ISSB standards are due mid-2022.
IOSCO, which groups securities regulators from the United States, Europe and Asia, said in a report on Monday that it was imperative that the ISSB establish strong governance, proven independence and rigorous due process.
There are significant gaps and shortcomings in sustainability-related information currently given to investors, IOSCO said in its report.
The watchdog said it plans to consider potential endorsement of standards issued by the ISSB to use for cross-border, and potentially domestic, purposes to guide investors.
All IOSCO members commit to implementing standards and guidance they endorse and this would lend strong backing to the ISSB across the world's main financial centres.

""Provided that IOSCO´s expectations are satisfied, we will consider setting a pathway for ... encouraging relevant authorities to consider those standards in their approaches to mandatory sustainability-related disclosures,"" said Erik Thedeen, chair of IOSCO's sustainable finance task force and director general of Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority.

Helping the tone was President Joe Biden over the weekend rowing back on the idea that he would veto a new $1.2 trillion bipartisan deal, announced late Thursday, if a separate Democratic spending plan didn’t also pass through Congress.
This would make it easier for Republicans to support the package in a deeply-divided Senate, paving the way for fresh investment in roads, bridges and broadband internet. 
Still, volatility is likely to be limited in the near term as investors focus on the release of the key monthly jobs report at the end of the week, with an improvement in the labor market needed before the Federal Reserve decides to change its monetary policies.
The June nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show that the economy added 675,000 new jobs, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.7% from 5.8%, while average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.3% on the month, after rising by 0.5% the previous month.
In corporate news, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will be in the spotlight after the drugmaker agreed over the weekend to pay $230 million to settle claims that it fueled the opioid crisis. 
Additionally, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is on the verge of agreeing airplane orders potentially worth $30 billion in a bid to secure extra capacity at favorable prices, Reuters reported.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) will also be in focus after the video game retailer, a volatile meme stock, was moved to the Russell 1000 index, with the change becoming effective Monday.
Crude oil prices traded basically flat Monday, near more than 2-year highs, ahead of the week’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC. 
By 6 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.1% at $73.98 a barrel, just off the recent high of $74.45, the highest since June 2018, while Brent was 0.3% lower at $75.38, after climbing to $76.60 late Friday, its highest since October 2018. 
OPEC+ is scheduled to meet on Thursday, and is likely to further ease current supply curbs as the fuel demand outlook continues to improve and prices rise.

Headcount at the city's financial insitutions will drop 5% by the end of 2023 to around 62,200 people, a result of cost-cutting measures, Helaba predicts. That is 3,300 people fewer than last autumn.
Financial jobs in the city have generally been on the rise since 2014 amid greater demand for staff overseeing compliance and regulation at banks, and as Britain's withdrawal from the European Union lured jobs from London.
Helaba expects 1,500 new Brexit-related jobs for Frankfurt this year and next, on top of 2,000 such jobs already created in 2020 and earlier.

Frankfurt is home to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and the European Central Bank as well as the European headquarters for scores of non-German banks.
Frankfurt has been dubbed Bankfurt or Mainhattan, after the river Main that the city straddles.

Its shares rose 3% to 2,632 pence in early trading after the company said like-for-like sales in shops managed by Greggs were up between 1% and 3% in recent weeks compared to the same period in 2019. 
""Since (the easing of restrictions on non-essential retail) we had expected to see increased competition as cafes and restaurants were allowed to compete more effectively with our largely take-out offer,"" the company said in a statement. 
However, Greggs warned that pent-up demand had reduced. 
While the company's shops have been able to stay open through the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis has disrupted its business model which relies on a high volume of customer visits.

Last month, London-listed Greggs raised its profit outlook, despite like-for-like sales in the eight weeks to May 8 falling 3.9%. Previously, the company had said it did not expect profit to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at least.

HONG KONG/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean game developer Krafton Inc said on Monday it will resubmit an application for a $5 billion domestic listing after the financial regulator raised some questions on the application, which sources said would delay its listing.
""Krafton plans to revise our IPO registration statement in response to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS)'s request,"" the company told Reuters in a text message. 
The delay of the initial public offering (IPO), set to be South Korea's biggest ever, could be for up to a fortnight as a result of the regulatory review, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The developer of smash hit game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was due to list on the Korean stock exchange in mid-July. 
The regulator was reviewing the company's listing documents but had not identified any major issue, one of the people said.
In its message, Krafton declined to comment on the IPO's delay.
The two sources could not be named as the information was not yet made public.
Krafton said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the FSS requested the company to resubmit the IPO registration statement because it considered the company's filing to have fallen into one of three possible categories: not have had a proper format; contained false information or an omission of important facts; or included unclear statements that might undermine investors' reasonable judgment or lead to serious misunderstanding.
If the company does not submit the revised registration statement within three months, the previously submitted statement will be considered withdrawn, according to local regulations.
Krafton had been pressing on its with IPO, meeting investors over the past fortnight and was due to hold more briefings this week before the deal was delayed, one of the people said.
Krafton said in a regulatory filing on June 16 it expected to offer 10 million shares, or 7 million new shares and 3 million existing shares, at an indicative range of 458,000-557,000 won per share. 
The IPO would have valued the company at about $30.9 billion. 

At $5 billion-plus, Krafton would become the biggest IPO in South Korea since the 4.9 trillion won ($4.4 billion) float of Samsung (KS:005930) Life Insurance in 2010, exchange data shows.
Krafton's second largest shareholder is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, which owns 15.35% of the company through an investment vehicle, according to the IPO filings.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's former board chairman lost his bid for re-election last week with 56% of votes cast against him, according to a breakdown of the results that marked a watershed moment for corporate governance in Japan.
The ouster of Osamu Nagayama follows an explosive independent investigation released this month that found Toshiba colluded with the trade ministry to block foreign shareholders from gaining influence at last year's annual general meeting.
Voting participation at this year's AGM was particularly high, exceeding 80% for the first time since 2010 when new disclosure rules were introduced. There were few abstentions, with votes in favour at 43.7%.
""Overseas investors who usually don't vote participated this time and voted against Nagayama, while some domestic investors also voted against him,"" said a Toshiba source, who was not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Nagayama only joined Toshiba's board in mid-2020 but critics argued he had to take responsibility for the board's resistance to address the allegations that overseas investors had been pressured.
Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis had recommended against his reappointment.
But Nagayama's failure to win re-election has only fanned concerns of a leadership vacuum at Toshiba, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015. 
""Growing management upheaval at Toshiba is increasingly likely to hurt its operating and financial performance,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said in a report on Monday.
CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa was appointed as interim chairman. Tsunakawa retook the CEO position in April after Toshiba's previous chief executive left, but Tsunakawa has said he does not plan to stay for too long.
New leadership at Toshiba will have to grapple with selecting a replacement for Tsunakawa as well as new board members that will satisfy its vocal activist shareholders.
It will also have to conduct a strategic review that has been promised in the wake of a $20 billion bid - which Toshiba has dismissed - from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners.

At the same time, it must navigate its relationship with the government which sees the maker of defence equipment and nuclear reactors as strategically important and which reports have said is considering new laws to make sure control over key technology remains within Japan.
Toshiba had initially put forward 13 nominees for the board. It withdrew two after the release of the investigators' report. Friday's AGM saw Nagayama and one other director voted out while another, a confidante of Nagayama, resigned leaving Toshiba with eight newly elected directors.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down by more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after the company was forced to roll out a safety fix for nearly 300,00 vehicles in China, in another setback for its image in the country.
The fix, which the country’s State Administration for Market Regulation is calling a ‘recall,’ covers 249,855 Model 3 sedans and Model Y compact crossover vehicles manufactured by Tesla’s Shanghai plant, as well as 35,665 imported Model 3 cars, according to the market regulator.
The recall of the U.S. company’s automobiles came after an investigation into possible defects, which found that the cruise-control system could be accidentally activated and potentially result in an unexpected speed increase, according to a WSJ report.
As per the report, Tesla has asked its customers to upgrade their cruise-control software remotely and doesn’t require going to the dealer.
China is the world’s largest market for EVs and Tesla’s largest outside the U.S. It’s important for Tesla not just because of its market size but also because it acts as a large source of parts and raw materials that go into its vehicles and batteries.  
Tesla has had to fight at various ends in China over the last few months, from customer and regulatory complaints over brake issues in its cars to security concerns over the cameras in its vehicles to rising competition from the likes of local carmakers like Geely, Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng."

Investing.com --  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) stock slumped in early trading in Europe on Monday after the luxury goods company said its chief executive Marco Gobbetti is leaving to become CEO of fashion rival Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (MI:SFER). 
The news was met with dismay by Burberry shareholders, who have seen Gobbetti turn around the group's fortunes since he was appointed in 2015, after an ill-advised foray downmarket that tried - and failed - to broaden its appeal. The company's stock rose 7% on the day of its latest quarterly results in March, when it raised its forecasts for the current year.
“With Burberry re-energized and firmly set on a path to strong growth, I feel that now is the right time for me to step down,” Gobbetti said in a statement issued by the company. 
By 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), Burberry shares were down 7.4% and on course for their biggest daily loss since the early stages of the pandemic last year. Ferrragamo stock was up a modest 0.3%, although that still represented a measure of outperformance on a generally uninspired start to the week. 
Under Gobbetti's stewardship, Burberry has reinvigorated its product line-up and - somewhat belatedly- expanded its online presence. The stock had nearly doubled since his appointment in 2015. However, the group had still underperformed many of its rivals. The start of the pandemic found it still largely dependent on a handful of flagship stores in London and Hong Kong, which were badly hit by the collapse in international tourism and the sustained pro-democracy protests, respectively. 
The stock price's drop on Monday means that the shares have actually lost over 3% in the last three years, according to Investing.com data. For comparison, Hermes and LVMH have both more than doubled in that timeeframe, while Christian Dior has risen 90%.
The only major luxury fashion name to have underperformed Burberry in that time has been Ferragamo, which is down 7%. Ferragamo, which specializes in formal menswear, was also hard hit by the pandemic. The family that controls the brand has reportedly been looking for new management for months, after rejecting various offers for a possible stake sale that would have resulted in its losing control of the company."
452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>","Macron rolls out red carpet to JPMorgan, global CEOs in post-Brexit push","PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron will declare that Paris is back on the map of global finance on Tuesday when he inaugurates JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s new trading hub in the French capital which he hopes will attract more bankers leaving post-Brexit Britain.
The U.S. bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, will be one of almost 120 international CEOs travelling to Versailles on Monday for Macron's now traditional ""Choose France"" summit in which he pitches France as an investment destination. 
The day after, Dimon and Macron will visit JPMorgan's new hub in central Paris, a stone's throw away from the Louvre museum, where about 440 employees will be based, many having relocated from London. 
Macron's advisers say that is testament to the appeal of France's pro-business reforms implemented since the former investment banker's election in 2017.
JPMorgan's new trading floor is the latest concrete example of how Brexit is changing Europe's financial landscape since January.
    Paris is at the vanguard of attempts to relocate clearing of euro derivatives from London to the EU after Britain's ""Big Bang"" liberalisation of financial rules in the 1980s drained EU financial capitals of such activity and staff.
    Global banks like JPMorgan have long used London as their EU gateway, but with Brexit largely severing Britain from the bloc's financial market, banks have spent millions of dollars on hubs in Paris, Frankfurt and elsewhere in the bloc to avoid disruption.
    EY has calculated that over 7,500 financial jobs and $1.3 trillion in assets have moved from London to the EU.
    After these initial moves, financial firms are now deciding if there is enough business in London and the EU for two operations to be profitable.
    ""We may reach a tipping point many years out when it may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe,"" Dimon told shareholders in a letter this year.
    New Financial think tank said in a report in May that Paris has attracted 102 of 440 firms from Britain that opened units in the EU, second only to Dublin's 135. 
Officials say past tax measures have helped create 3,000 new finance jobs in Paris since Brexit and no new perks are planned this week when Macron courts executives in the palace of Versailles. 

    ""London had everything. Our ambition is for Paris to have everything too,"" an advisor to Macron told reporters.

Speculation over a possible management shake-up at Ferragamo has been circulating for some time, even after the Ferragamo family confirmed current Chief Executive Micaela Le Divelec on March. 
Ferragamo has been hit harder than most rivals by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and is often cited by industry observers as a possible takeover target as smaller companies are less able to hedge themselves against changes in trends and tastes than the conglomerates in the industry.
The Italian luxury group last year called back former CEO Michele Norsa as executive director to help management revamp the brand and weather the COVID-19 storm.
Ferragamo, famous for shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn, said Gobbetti would take up his new position as soon as he is released from his contractual obligations. 
In a separate statement Burberry said Gobbetti would be leaving the British group at the end of 2021.

A former CEO of Moschino, Gobbetti spent 13 years in the LVMH group where he was CEO of Givenchy and Celine, before taking up his current post at Burberry, Ferragamo said. 
Shares in Ferragamo were up 2.6% by 0704 GMT, outperforming a roughly flat All-Share index.

Financial market sources told Reuters last month the company was considering an IPO as soon as this summer and could raise about $500 million. Chief Executive Andrei Yanovsky said this month the firm was always ready to turn to capital markets for funds.
Certain existing shareholders, including Igor Shilov, who now holds a 71.2% stake in EMC, would sell global depositary receipts (GDRs) in the company. EMC will not sell any GDRs in the offering, nor will it receive any proceeds. 
EMC said Shilov would remain a significant shareholder in the company after the offering. 
EMC, which operates a network of medical centres in and around Moscow, reported revenue of 21.3 billion roubles ($295 million) last year, with a compound annual growth rate for 2018-2020 of 18%.
""The Russian healthcare market has been growing at a rapid clip for several years, with the paid services segment expanding at the fastest pace,"" Yanovsky said in a statement. 
He said Russia's market for healthcare services was undervalued and therefore attractive going forward. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Ltd, J.P. Morgan AG and VTB Capital PLC are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners in connection with the offering, EMC said. 
Russia's IPO market has been resurgent in recent months, with online retailer Ozon, low-cost retailer Fix Price and forestry group Segezha all listing since November. 
But a decision by gold producer Nordgold to postpone a potentially multi-billion London debut listings has raised concerns that the fastest flurry of Russian stock-market listings under the sanctions era has run its course.

China Tourism, which Refinitiv data showed has market capitalisation of 577.9 billion yuan ($89.43 billion), filed for the listing with the Hong Kong bourse late on Friday.
Its Shanghai shares were trading 4% higher on Monday on news of the application. The stock is up 9.6% so far in 2021, versus the benchmark CSI300 index's 0.6% increase, yet remains 23% below its 52-week high reached on Feb 18.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) will offer telecom operators Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) new services ranging from running 5G over a cloud platform to using artificial intelligence, the U.S. technology company said on Monday.
Big technology players such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are vying for a share of 5G revenue by offering telecom operators next-generation software tools.
IBM, using technology it obtained from buying software firm Red Hat, will offer the telecom operators cloud services to run their networks and assist them in selling products tailored to customers. No financial terms were disclosed about the tie-ups, which broadened IBM's existing partnerships with the two firms.
A cloud platform uses software instead of physical equipment to perform network functions, helping telecom operators build 5G networks faster, reduce costs and sell customised services.
""It's a disruptive time in this particular market segment, telcos are trying to position themselves as the destination for services like augmented reality, machine learning and AI,"" Darell Jordan-Smith, vice president of Redhat, told Reuters.

On the AI front, IBM and Spain's Telefonica have created a virtual assistant that they say will remove friction points, such as long wait times, by automating the handling of frequently asked questions and tasks like billing.
""We see this as an existential moment for telco operators with 5G: architecturally, they're looking to gain more control on their platforms and rethink their network as a digital world rather than a structured physical model,"" said Steve Canepa, IBM's general manager for communications business.

Great Wall's revenue is expected to reach 600 billion yuan ($92.86 billion) in 2025, Wei said in a briefing on the company's strategy at its headquarters.
Great Wall, which sold 1.1 million cars last year, aims for 80% of its annual sales in 2025 to be new energy vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Monday morning as the more virulent Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus continues to spread while central banks contemplate withdrawing their stimulus measures.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.15% by 10:21 PM ET (2:21 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.26%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.17% with the city of Sydney currently under lockdown to deal with its latest outbreak involving the Delta COVID-19 variant. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is also due to address a banking summit in the city on Tuesday.
Hong Kong markets were closed in the morning.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.02% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.60%. The country has a busy week ahead, with the manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes (PMIs) due on Wednesday and President Xi Jinping delivering a speech to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party a day later.
Global shares climbed back towards record highs as investors digested inflation data released by the U.S. during the previous week. The core personal consumption expenditures index grew a smaller-than-expected 0.5% month-on-month in May while growing 3.4% year-on-year.
Investors also continue to monitor progress on U.S. President Joe Biden’s bipartisan U.S. infrastructure agreement, valued at $1.2 trillion over eight years.
""Investors are keenly watching the progress of Biden's bipartisan infrastructure deal through Congress. The package could boost demand significantly, driven by investment in renewables and electronic vehicle (EV) infrastructure,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.
Concern over the U.S. Federal Reserve’s shock hawkish stance in its latest policy decision handed down earlier in the month is also fading, in turn boosting investor sentiment.
Even as fewer investors remain concerned about rising inflationary pressures forcing the central bank to hike interest rates, concerns remain about how the Fed’s decision will impact other central banks moving forward.
The Fed “is far away from tapering, they are far away from increasing rates, but at some point, if the markets see the Fed being too far behind the curve you will start to see some adjustment on the long end of the curve,” FlowBank SA chief investment officer Charles-Henry Monchau told Bloomberg.

By Sophie Yu and Kane Wu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -He Shuang, a student at a U.S. university stranded in her home city of Chongqing in southwest China during the pandemic, has added more than 300 domestic brands to her list of favourites on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Taobao online mall.
Like with He, Chinese brands are hot with most shoppers and have spurred billions of dollars in investment, as consumers increasingly make patriotic choices amid a growing backlash against foreign brands https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/chinese-apps-join-celebs-backlash-against-western-fashion-brands-over-xinjiang-2021-03-26 in the country.
A surge in online shopping after people were forced indoors due to COVID-19 last year, a recovery in the market since then, and infrastructure that allows vendors to scale up swiftly have also propelled demand for local brands.
""Once you try, you find the quality of local products is as good as foreign products,"" said the 19-year old He, who favours home-grown labels from Carslan eye shadows and Feiyue sneakers to Bestore Co snacks and Miniso homeware.
Maia Active, a Sequoia Capital-backed athleisure wear maker, said its products were designed based on body measurements of Asian women and, therefore, offered local customers a better fit and more comfort than western counterparts.
In lockstep with demand, investors too have been pouring funds into local consumer brands this year.
Chinese consumer firms raised 69.7 billion yuan ($11 billion) from primary market investors in the first five months, more than double the year-earlier amount, according to Cygnus Equity, a Chinese boutique investment bank. 
""Beauty products, food and beverage brands are the most popular. Recently hotpot and ramen brands are particularly coveted,"" said Ming Jin, managing partner at Cygnus. 
Up to 200 brands are currently seeking new capital from investors, bankers and investors said.
""China is the easiest market for building something from zero to a 100-million-yuan sales target,"" a private equity investor in tea chain operator Nayuki said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.
Nayuki last week raised $656 million in a Hong Kong float, which gave it a valuation of $4.4 billion, more than double the level in a December funding round.
Weilong Delicious Global Holdings, whose flour-based spicy sticks sell for under 5 yuan per pack, raised 3.56 billion yuan in May from big name investors including Tencent, Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital, CPE, Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital China. The snack maker was valued at nearly 70 billion yuan.
Sequoia-backed Genki Forest, a soft drink brand seeking to challenge Coca Cola, said it was valued at $6 billion after an April fundraising, ten times more than 18 months earlier.
Its fundraising attracted investors such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH's private equity arm and Singaporean state investor Temasek.
LOCAL VS GLOBAL
During JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com's online shopping festival this month, sales growth of Chinese brands was 4% higher than international brands. The growth in their customer numbers exceeded that of international brands by 16%, JD.com said.
Chris Mulliken, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy EY, said nationalism was a factor driving the popularity of local brands, including pride in China's recovery from COVID-19 even as several other countries battle high infection rates.
""People are travelling (albeit domestically) and taking the opportunity to rediscover their own country, return to their customs and discover new Chinese brands,"" he said.
The recent Xinjiang cotton ban imposed by several global brands including H&M,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) over concerns about alleged rights abuses in the province, which offended many Chinese consumers, was another catalyst. China strongly denies the claims and says all labour in Xinjiang is consensual and contract-based.
Shares of domestic sportswear producers Xtep, Li Ning and Anta have risen 196%, 60% and 38% respectively since April.
Dealmakers have warned about the sharply higher valuations, while they also say the demand trend will stay for a long time.

""Consumers no longer idolize international, multinational brands. They like products and brands that speak for them,"" said Nina Gong, a Beijing-based managing director with private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG).

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Friday an attacker had won access to one of its customer-service agents and then used information from that to launch hacking attempts against customers.
The company said it had found the compromise during its response to hacks by a team it identifies as responsible for earlier major breaches at SolarWinds and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Microsoft said it had warned the affected customers. A copy of one warning seen by Reuters said the attacker belonged to the group Microsoft calls Nobelium and that it had access during the second half of May.
""A sophisticated Nation-State associated actor that Microsoft identifies as NOBELLIUM accessed Microsoft customer support tools to review information regarding your Microsoft Services subscriptions,"" the warning reads in part. The U.S. government has publicly attributed the earlier attacks to the Russian government, which denies involvement.
When Reuters asked about that warning, Microsoft announced the breach publicly.
After commenting on a broader phishing campaign it said had compromised a small number of entities, Microsoft said it had also found the breach of its own agent, who it said had limited powers.
The agent could see billing contact information and what services the customers pay for, among other things.
""The actor used this information in some cases to launch highly-targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign,"" Microsoft said.
Microsoft warned affected customers to be careful about communications to their billing contacts and consider changing those usernames and email addresses, as well as barring old usernames from logging in.
Microsoft said it was aware of three entities that had been compromised in the phishing campaign.
It did not immediately clarify whether any had been among those whose data was viewed through the support agent, or if the agent had been tricked by the broader campaign.
Microsoft did not say whether the agent was at a contractor or a direct employee.
A spokesman said the latest breach by the threat actor was not part of Nobelium's previous successful attack on Microsoft, in which it obtained some source code.
In the SolarWinds attack, the group altered code at that company to access SolarWinds customers, including nine U.S. federal agencies.
At the SolarWinds customers and others, the attackers also took advantage of weaknesses in the way Microsoft programs were configured, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Microsoft later said the group had compromised its own employee accounts and taken software instructions governing how Microsoft verifies user identities.
A White House official said the latest intrusion and phishing campaign was far less serious than the SolarWinds fiasco.
""This appears to be largely unsuccessful, run-of-the-mill espionage,"" the official said.

Scott McConnell, a spokesman for Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the defensive group “is working with Microsoft and our interagency partners to evaluate the impact. We stand ready to assist any affected entities.” 
A SolarWinds spokesperson said, ""The latest cyberattack reported by Microsoft does not involve our company or our customers in any way.""

Investors were concerned about a spike in coronavirus infections in Asia with Australia's most populous city of Sydney plunging into a lockdown after a cluster of cases involving the highly contagious Delta strain ballooned.
Indonesia is battling record high cases while a lockdown in Malaysia is set to be extended. Thailand too announced new restrictions in Bangkok and other provinces. 
Last week, global shares reached record highs as weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and news of a bipartisan U.S. infrastructure agreement boosted risk appetite. (N)

On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 2.7% for the week, its strongest weekly gain since early February after data showed a measure of underlying inflation rose less than expected in May, easing fears of a sudden tapering in stimulus by the Federal Reserve. (N)
The Dow climbed 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.06% after holding near the previous session's record high. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed at a record high of 721.91.
""The Fed is widely expected to advance its communication on tapering during Q3. The baseline market expectation is that tapering will start in January and run at US$10 billion per month,"" ANZ economists said.
""However, if inflation stays elevated, tapering might have to start sooner and happen at a faster pace.""
Views on inflation outlook remain mixed though, underlining market caution over potential volatility ahead of key economic data and corporate earnings reports. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s top strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note that U.S. inflation will remain elevated for two to four years, and only a market crash will prevent central banks from tightening in the next six months.
Later in the week, a closely-watched U.S. jobs report will be released for June which could point to strong labour demand.

Futures in New York were little changed after a fifth weekly gain, while global benchmark Brent traded near its highest level since October 2018. The alliance gathers on Thursday to discuss its production policy for August, with the group expected to revive more halted output. The market has firmed in a bullish structure as the global vaccine rollout boosts demand.
Oil is up more than 50% this year as a robust rebound from the pandemic in key regions such as the U.S. and China underpins fuel consumption. The rapid recovery has also drained stockpiles built up during Covid-19, with the International Energy Agency urging OPEC+ to keep markets balanced.
An increase in Iranian crude flows is also unlikely to materialize any time soon as talks to revive a nuclear deal drag on. Some analysts predict the election of conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi as Iran’s new president may delay a pact.
The prompt timespread for Brent was 80 cents a barrel in backwardation -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 85 cents a week earlier.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>",Boeing 777X 'realistically' will not win certification approval before mid-2023 - U.S. FAA,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has told Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co that its planned 777X is not yet ready for a significant certification step and warned it ""realistically"" will not certify the airplane until mid- to late 2023.
The FAA in a May 13 letter to Boeing seen by Reuters cited a number of issues in rejecting a request by the manufacturer to issue a Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) Readiness. ""The aircraft is not yet ready for TIA,"" the FAA wrote, declining to approve ""a phased TIA of limited scope with a small number of certification flight test plans.""
The letter, which had not previously been made public, cites numerous concerns about lack of data and the lack of a preliminary safety assessment for the FAA to review.
“The FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,"" the agency said in a statement Sunday.
Boeing has been developing the widebody jet, a new version of its popular 777 aircraft, since 2013 and at one expected to release it for airline use in 2020.
A Boeing spokeswoman said on Sunday that the company ""remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development. As we subject the airplane to a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability, we are working through a rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements.""
The 777X will be the first major jet to be certified since software flaws in two Boeing 737 MAX planes caused fatal crashes and prompted accusations of cozy relations between the company and FAA.
European regulators have said in particular that they will subject the 777X to extra scrutiny after the fatal crashes prompted the 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX. 
The MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months in 2018 and 2019.
The letter cites a number of issues that still need to be addressed, including an ""upcoming major software update with the software load of flight control... The FAA understands that there are many significant problem report items that will be addressed by that version of the software load, including the software fix for the un-commanded pitch event that occurred on December 8, 2020.""
The agency added that ""software load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays.""
It said that ""after the un-commanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation.""
The agency said it wants Boeing to ""implement a robust process so similar escape will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.""
The FAA said in its letter certification date for the 777X ""is realistically going to be mid to late 2023 (>2 years from now.""

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said earlier this month that ""we are still confident"" it will be certified in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The letter was reported earlier by the Seattle Times.

""Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) de México is preparing a return to activities for its three manufacturing segments,"" the company said in a statement.
Automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have cut production this year due to the shortage of semiconductor chips, which was caused by factors including a rise in demand for electronic devices during the pandemic and fast recovery in auto markets.

Volkswagen said there is a general expectation that the chip supply will improve in the second half but the company added that ""possible future adjustments (to production) cannot be ruled out.""
Production of the Jetta, Taos and Tiguan models will be resumed separately and on different dates starting next week and during the month of July, Volkswagen said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has ratcheted up the heat on U.S. ecommerce giants like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), accusing them of arrogance and of flouting local laws by indulging in predatory pricing practices.
Goyal said companies were using their scale and access to large pools of low-cost capital to indulge in predatory pricing practices ""to the detriment of mom-and-pop stores."" 
""A number of these large ecommerce companies have come into India and very blatantly flouted the laws of the land in more ways than one,"" he told a virtual event late on Saturday.
""I've had several engagements with these large companies, particularly the American ones, and I can see a little bit of arrogance,"" he said.
Goyal did not directly name Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Walmart Inc's Flipkart - the two dominant ecommerce players in India - or specify which laws had been flouted. But his comments come at a time of growing clamour from small Indian traders and retailers, who accuse the U.S. giants of circumventing Indian consumer protection laws and competition laws. 
Amazon and Flipkart did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Goyal's scathing criticism. 
The two companies have denied the allegations levelled against them by the traders. 
Goyal also criticised companies for indulging in ""forum shopping"" in courts and failing to comply with an investigation launched by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).
Flipkart and Amazon have appealed against the CCI's bid to restart an investigation into their business practices, after a judge this month dismissed the companies' original pleas.
""To my mind, if they have nothing to hide, if they are doing honest business practices, why don't they respond to the CCI?"" Goyal said at the virtual event organised by the Stanford India Policy and Economics Club.
His comments came days after India unveiled a new set of ecommerce regulations that could dent both Amazon and Flipkart's ambitions in India, and force the duo to review certain business structures.
Separately, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, the Confederation of All India Traders, accused ecommerce companies of treating India like a ""banana republic"" with weak laws. 

The body urged the government to ensure that the proposed e-commerce rules were not diluted, despite the lobbying efforts of ecommerce giants.
The U.S.-India Business Council, a top U.S. lobby group, described India's proposed new ecommerce rules as concerning in an internal memo this week.

(Reuters) -Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd expects to reduce its cash burn to less than HK$1 billion ($128.84 million) a month in the second half of the year, its chief financial officer said.
The airline had been burning up to HK$1.9 billion of cash per month in the first half due to crew quarantine restrictions but that will fall in the second half as rules are eased for vaccinated crew and capacity rises, Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Sharpe said at an analyst briefing on Friday.
A webcast of the invitation-only briefing was made public on Saturday evening.
Cathay has been operating just 8% of its usual passenger capacity at a time when passenger numbers are down more than 99% due to international border restrictions. 
""There has been no significant change in the last few months in the dramatic impact COVID-19 has had on passengers to Hong Kong,"" Sharpe said.
By August, it hopes to increase capacity to 20% of pre-COVID levels as Chinese students return to the United States and Britain for studies and that could rise to 30% in the fourth quarter as travel restrictions to Singapore and mainland China ease, Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said.
Cathay this month said losses in the first half are expected to be ""somewhat"" lower than last year, due to cost-saving measures and strong demand for cargo flights.
The monthly cash burn figure at Cathay is a bit higher than the S$100 million ($74.51 million) to S$150 million ongoing level reported by rival Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd last month.
Both airlines lack domestic markets and have been reliant on cargo traffic for most of their revenue since the pandemic began.
Cathay said 89 of the 239 planes in its fleet were in long-term storage in Australia and Spain. The airline has HK$32.8 billion liquidity available and will consider raising more funds when it can be done at a reasonable cost, Sharpe said.

Carlo Messina said in an newspaper interview on Sunday that Italian banks were now ""among those in the best shape"" in Europe, thanks to a process of consolidation and reduction of bad loans.
""For Italy, I hope to see further concentrations to arrive at the creation of at least three poles,"" he told financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.
Italy has a fragmented banking system, with scores of lenders, many of them small and regional, and often unprofitable.
Intesa Sanpaolo kicked off a new wave of consolidation in the sector last year by taking over rival UBI, while UniCredit, the country's second largest bank, is weighing potential merger options under new CEO Andrea Orcel.
Government sources have told Reuters that some members of the ruling coalition would like to see a third group built around Banco BPM, Italy's No.3 bank, which is often seen as a likely takeover target. 
Messina also urged Mario Draghi's government to consider prolonging and broadening state guarantees on loans to companies, as Italy tries to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Extending the expiry (of the guarantees) to 20 years would allow companies in difficulty enough time to reorganise and get going again,"" he said.

More broadly, he urged the government to maintain support measures to help firms and individuals recover from last year's steep COVID-induced recession, warning against hasty withdrawal of special job protection rules introduced during the pandemic.
""The social fabric of the country is at risk,"" he warned.

Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, who make the Eurofighter, have also offered Bern sweeping political cooperation should it win the Swiss contest between two U.S. and two European fighter jets, which are to be delivered by 2025.
The Swiss cabinet is set to decide on Wednesday among the Eurofighter, the Rafale from France's Dassault, Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s F/A-18 Super Hornet and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F35-A Lightning II to replace ageing F/A-18 Hornets.
Swiss television reported last week that the F-35 provided the best technical and financial features in a Swiss evaluation, but the final decision was still open.
The SonntagsZeitung paper quoted Bernhard Brenner, head of sales at Airbus Defence and Space, as saying neutral Switzerland should not go by that evaluation alone.
""The economic and political elements are just as important,"" he said. The paper said Airbus has submitted a 700-page dossier on economic ""offsets"" alone, referring to side deals that funnel contract costs back to local suppliers. 
The government is split among those who favour the F-35 and those who would prefer a European deal to help smoothe relations with the European Union after Switzerland ditched a draft bilateral treaty after years of talks.
The defence ministers of Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain wrote to Bern last year offering not just military cooperation such as training, but also partnerships in economics, energy, science, the environment, transport, cybersecurity and infrastructure, Brenner told the paper.

France has been pushing Bern to pick the Rafale, while U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the deal with Swiss leaders while in Geneva this month to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The defence ministry has declined to comment on the process.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson said on Saturday it will pay $263 million to resolve claims it fueled an opioid epidemic in New York state and two of its largest counties.
The settlements remove the drugmaker from a jury trial scheduled to begin on Tuesday on Long Island, where several big opioid makers and distributors are also defendants.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) did not admit liability or wrongdoing in settling with New York state, and with Nassau and Suffolk counties. The $229.9 million state settlement also calls for J&J to stop selling the painkillers nationwide.
“The opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc"" across the nation, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. ""Johnson & Johnson helped fuel this fire.""
She said her focus remains ""getting funds into communities devastated by opioids as quickly as possible.""
J&J said the settlements were consistent with its prior agreement to pay $5 billion to settle opioid claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments nationwide.
The healthcare company and the largest U.S. drug distributors - AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) - have proposed paying a combined $26 billion to end thousands of opioid lawsuits.
J&J has also been appealing an Oklahoma judge's 2019 ruling that the New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company pay that state $465 million for its deceptive marketing of opioids.
Tuesday's opioids trial is one of several scheduled for this year, with others underway in California and West Virginia.
Drugmakers  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and several distributors are among the defendants. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc is also a defendant, though it was sued only by the counties.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) were severed from the trial during jury selection. CVS has settled with Nassau and Suffolk counties. Settlement terms have not been disclosed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses from 1999 to 2019.

The drug, which has a list price of $56,000 per year, was approved by the U.S. regulators as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's on June 7. 
""We have serious concerns about the steep price of Biogen's new Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm and the process that led to its approval despite questions about the drug's clinical benefit,"" House Committee on Oversight and Reform said in a statement.
The investigation has been announced by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
Biogen said it will ""of course cooperate with any inquiry we may receive from these committees,"" in response to a Reuters request for comment. 
At $56,000 a year, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that Medicare could spend $57 billion or more per year on Aduhelm, which is more than Medicare Part B spends on all other drugs combined, the House Committee said. 
Health insurers and the Medicare program will bear most of the cost of the drug, whose price will vary based on dosage and discounts.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug - despite strong objection from its own expert advisory panel - for all patients with Alzheimer's, although it has only been tested for patients in the early stages of the disease.

Three of the 11 members of FDA's independent advisory panel have resigned in protest over the agency's decision.

For each vaccine, the fact sheets for healthcare providers have been revised to include a warning that reports of adverse events suggest increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly after the second dose and with onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination, the FDA said. 
As of June 11, more than 1,200 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), out of about 300 million mRNA vaccine doses administered. 
The cases appear to be notably higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose. The CDC identified 309 hospitalizations from heart inflammation in persons under the age of 30, of which 295 have been discharged.
Health regulators in several countries have been investigating cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, more frequently found in young men, after a shot of Pfizer or Moderna, vaccines that are based on the mRNA technology. 

The latest update from FDA follows an extensive review of information and the discussion by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday.
Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 shook off concerns about a more hawkish Federal Reserve to post a record high this week, but activity in some areas of the market indicates concern over potential volatility ahead of key economic data and corporate profit reports.
U.S. President Joe Biden’s embrace of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending deal has helped buoy indexes to fresh records, after worries that the Fed may unwind its easy money policies sooner than expected led to a brief swoon earlier this month. The benchmark S&P 500 is up about 14% this year after hitting a fresh record in the past week, as did the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
Underneath the hood, however, there are signs of caution. Short interest in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY) increased to its highest level this year since last week's Fed meeting, suggesting investors have been adding more downside protection, JP Morgan analysts said in a recent note.
At the same time, gains this month have been more concentrated, as investors piled back into the big technology stocks that led markets higher last year and for most of the past decade. 
The benchmark S&P index, heavily weighted toward technology stocks, is up 1.8% this month, but the average S&P stock has lagged. The equal-weighted S&P 500 is up just 0.3% in June, which some investors view as a sign of waning confidence in the broader market.
“The market has maybe dodged a few scares and as we look ahead to the second half... there are probably some more risks ahead than there were a few months ago,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.
Investor concerns include the debate about whether rising inflation will be sustained enough to force the Fed to begin a sooner-than-expected rollback of its easy-money policies. The Fed's main inflation measure posted its biggest annual increase since 1992, data showed Friday.
As business rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic, the second quarter is also expected to mark the peak for U.S. economic and corporate profit growth, which could bring market unease as growth slows.
Citigroup’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which measures the degree to which data is beating or missing forecasts, stands at 26.5, well off last year’s peak of 270.8, suggesting that the strength of the economic recovery is increasingly baked into estimates.
Some investors also believe the S&P may be overdue for a significant pullback. Since World War II, the index has had a decline of at least 5% an average of every 178 calendar days, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The latest market advance has lasted 276 days without such a fall, the longest period since January 2018, when a 715-day advance was followed by a 10.8% drop for the S&P 500.
""There is not a lot of support beneath the surface so that leaves the market maybe a little more vulnerable to a news headline or a news scare,” said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist with market research firm All Star Charts.
Next week’s focus will be on economic data, including reports on home prices, manufacturing and Friday’s closely-watched U.S. payrolls report for June. With inflation and the pace of the recovery on the minds of investors, a stronger-than-expected wage report could stoke worries over how the Fed will react. New York Fed president John Williams will speak on Monday, after several appearances in the past week. 
To be sure, there are plenty of factors that suggest the backdrop for equities remains positive. S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise by about 37% this year and almost 12% next year, according to Refinitiv IBES. In the second quarter, for which reports will flood in starting in mid-July, earnings are expected to jump 65%.
Yields remain historically low, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield down to about 1.52% from 1.7% in mid-May, helping boost the allure of equities in comparison to other investments. 

Still, only 47% of S&P 500 stocks stood above their 50-day moving averages as of Thursday's close, compared to 91% of stocks above that level when the index was making record highs in mid-April, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. The average stock in the benchmark was 8.9% off its 52-week high.
“If you are not in the few stocks that are doing well, you may be doing much worse than the benchmark index,” Lerner said.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>",Some options data reflect views of impending volatility - Goldman,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - While major U.S. stock indexes reach new highs, options data suggests traders see the market as vulnerable to a big drop should bears gain the upper hand, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Apparent calm in the stock market masks heightened expectations for big stock market gyrations over the next three months, Goldman strategists said in a note on Friday.
One indication of how anxious investors are is the fact that the 3-month downside implied volatility skew, which compares put option prices with at-the-money option prices, has reached new all-time highs, the note said.
""High skew reflects investors’ perception that high volatility would return should markets sell off,"" the strategists said.
The elevated level of skew reflects views that stocks would become increasingly correlated in such a scenario, the strategists said.
The strategists expect markets' sensitivity to economic data to increase with time, and recommended longer-dated hedges rather than ones with a shorter tenor.

The S&P 500 Index ended the week at record high on Friday, lifted by  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and several banks, while weaker-than-expected inflation data eased worries about a sudden tapering in stimulus by the Federal Reserve. 
The Cboe Volatility Index - often called Wall Street's fear gauge - finished down 2.2 points at 15.62, not far from the more than 16-month low of 14.19 touched on Thursday.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Friday ordered 7-Eleven to sell over 200 retail outlets following its $21 billion acquisition of the Speedway fuel chain from Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC). 
Marathon Petroleum, which owned the Speedway chain, and 7-Eleven, owned by Japan's Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd, announced last month they had closed the $21 billion deal involving some 3,800 stores in 36 states.
Two top FTC officials had previously said the deal was potentially illegal, Reuters reported.

In a proposed consent order with the companies, the FTC said 7-Eleven and Marathon are required to divest 124 retail fuel outlets to Anabi Oil, 106 retail fuel outlets to Cross America Partners and 63 retail fuel outlets to Jacksons Food Stores.
Because the U.S. gasoline and diesel markets are highly localized, the complaint alleged that the acquisition will harm competition in 293 markets across 20 states.

However, as the global automobile industry continues to recover in tandem with the economic recovery, established companies  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Honda Motor (HMC) and Volvo (VLVLY (OTC:VLVLY)) appear poised to overtake TSLA soon. Read on.The world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominated the global automobile industry last year as the demand for EVs skyrocketed. Moreover, with most governments announcing their plans to phase out fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, the EV giant gained significant traction.
While TSLA is still the biggest EV company, its stock looks highly overvalued at its current price level given the company’s relatively low profit margin. Furthermore, because the current semiconductor shortage is affecting the EV industry significantly, increasing production costs and low sales might cause TSLA’s shares to retreat in the coming months.
Regardless, overall automobile sales projected to rise in the recovering global economy despite temporary headwinds in the EV industry. Given this backdrop, we believe established car manufacturers Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC) and  Volvo ADR  (VLVLY) will grow substantially in the near term, potentially overtaking TSLA.

(Reuters) -A divided U.S. appeals court ruled in favor of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) on Friday by giving the German automaker another chance to end a lawsuit claiming it defrauded bondholders by concealing how it cheated pollution tests for its vehicles.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a lower court judge misapplied the law in refusing to dismiss the proposed class action by holders of $8.3 billion of bonds VW sold in 2014 and 2015, and ordered he look at the case again.
VW had said the plaintiff, Puerto Rico Government Employees and Judiciary Retirement System Administration, could not have been misled by marketing materials for the bonds because it had not shown it relied on them.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer had ruled in September 2019 that reliance on the German automaker's silence about the cheating was presumed, citing the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States.
But in Friday's 2-1 decision, Circuit Judge Milan Smith said the presumption did not apply because the plaintiff also claimed to have relied on nine pages of VW's affirmative misrepresentations.
""Plaintiff can prove reliance through ordinary means by demonstrating a connection between the alleged misstatements and its injury,"" Smith wrote. ""Otherwise, the exception would swallow the rule.""
VW's lawyer Robert Giuffra, vice chair at Sullivan & Cromwell, welcomed the decision, saying the plaintiff was trying to make Affiliated Ute ""an open-ended presumption that would apply in every case.""
Mitchell Twersky, a lawyer at Abraham Fruchter & Twersky representing the plaintiff, said there were ""adequate grounds"" to challenge the decision, which he said overly burdened securities fraud plaintiffs.
VW admitted in 2015 to having secretly used illegal software to evade emissions rules over six years.

It pleaded guilty in 2017 to fraud in a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The scandal has cost VW more than 32 billion euros ($38.2 billion) worldwide.
The case is Puerto Rico Government Employees and Judiciary Retirement Systems Administration v Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1556.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>",United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble to retire at end of June,"By Shreyasee Raj and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) on Friday said President Rory Gamble will retire at the end of June, a year before completing his tenure, after steering the union through a multiyear federal corruption investigation.
Gamble, 65, took charge of the 400,000-strong labor union in late 2019 from Gary Jones, who was ousted for embezzling union funds and sentenced to 28 months in jail.
Gamble worked with prosecutors to reform the union, which represents hourly workers at the U.S. plants for automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis.
A UAW spokesperson said the executive board began meeting Friday afternoon on naming a successor to Gamble.
""After looking at the progress we have made and the best interests of UAW members for a stable transfer of power, this is the right time for me to turn over the reins,"" Gamble said in a statement, adding he had initially intended to retire at this time before he was named president. 
The UAW did not make Gamble available for further comment.
During Gamble's presidential tenure, the union agreed to independent oversight to resolve a five-year federal corruption investigation in which Jones and his predecessor Dennis Williams pleaded guilty. 
The U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, which led the corruption probe, declined to comment on Gamble's retirement. 
Gamble has also pushed to protect the interests of union workers as the industry shifts to electric vehicles, which require fewer parts to build and put UAW jobs at risk. The union has encouraged lawmakers to revise federal tax incentives for EVs to require U.S. assembly.
Many UAW autoworkers earn their livings building Detroit-brand, petroleum-burning pickup trucks and SUVs or assembling engines and other components.
""He (Gamble) is a tough but fair leader, cares deeply about the industry and Ford, and has shown his commitment to his UAW colleagues,"" Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. 
Under Gamble, the union has also pushed GM and Ford to allow the UAW to represent workers at the automakers' planned joint venture electric-battery plants. The UAW also has been critical of the U.S. automakers' plans to boost manufacturing in Mexico, where workers are paid far less. 

""He has steered the union through challenging and unprecedented times, which includes a global pandemic,"" Stellantis Americas chief Mike Manley said of Gamble. 
Among Gamble's possible successors are UAW Secretary-Treasurer Ray Curry and Vice Presidents Cindy Estrada and Terry Dittes, who lead the Stellantis and GM departments, respectively.

We think that amid near zero benchmark interest rates and surging inflation, high dividend yielding stocks China Shenhua (CSUAY), Volvo (VLVLY), Imperial (IMBBY (OTC:IMBBY)) and Ternium (TX) should be ideal investment bets now. Let’s discuss.Dividend investing is a highly efficacious style amid current market conditions, given the steady stream of income dividend-paying stocks can offer. With the Federal Reserve committed to holding the interest rates at their current levels for roughly two more years amid ascending inflation rates, investors are parking a portion of their investable money in dividend-paying stocks to hedge against market volatility and secure higher-than-benchmark yields.
The fast-paced macroeconomic recovery should drive the growth of several industries that were hit by the pandemic. And an expected increase in companies’ cash flows should enable them to ensure at least steady dividend payments for investors, and perhaps even increased payments.
Therefore, we believe high dividend yielding stocks China Shenhua Energy Company Limited (CSUAY), Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY), Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB) (IMBBY) and Ternium S.A. (TX) are ideal bets now.

While CLOV may have a good future ahead of it, Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) are better buys right now.As I’ve covered in an article last week, meme stocks have been the talk of the Street this year. This week investors heard quite a lot about Clover Health (CLOV). CLOV is a healthcare technology company that uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. 
In fact, this health insurance technology company was one of the most-discussed stocks on Reddit this week. The stock rose 20% on Tuesday and 9.5% on Wednesday as Reddit traders pushed its value up after talk of the company becoming a target of a short squeeze. Even Chamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist behind the company, discouraged traders from buying the stock due to being a short squeeze target.
Retail traders nonetheless kept pushing its price higher. While the company could have a great future ahead of it, I would advise investing in other health insurance stocks, as the volatile nature of CLOV's price swings may be too high for risk averse investors. Companies such as  Molina Healthcare Inc . (MOH), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Cigna Corporation (CI) are more established and rank highly in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 04:24PM ET</span>",Biden's EV charging push could boost automakers taking on Tesla,"By Subrat Patnaik and Chavi Mehta
(Reuters) -President Joe Biden's plan to spend billions on U.S. charging networks could encourage more Americans to buy electric vehicles, giving General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) much-needed fuel in the battle against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Biden's administration on Thursday embraced a bipartisan Senate deal to spend $1.2 trillion on infrastructure projects, including $7.5 billion on EV infrastructure, including charging stations. Any bill must be passed by both houses of Congress, which are narrowly controlled by Biden's Democrats.[nL2N2O60YE]
""It's necessary for the consumers to get better infrastructure to buy EVs and it might be good for General Motors and Ford as well as Stellantis,"" said Frank Schwope, automotive analyst at NORD/LB.
Previously, Biden had sought $15 billion for EV charging stations. In a 2018 report, consultancy firm McKinsey estimated that the United States will need about $11 billion of capital investment by 2030 to deploy the 13 million chargers needed for the country's EVs.
""Effective legislation should include investments in charging infrastructure, particularly in urban areas and along highway corridors, that will help give consumers even more confidence to buy electric,"" GM said in a statement.
Ford said in a statement it was ""encouraging"" to see bipartisan progress on overdue investments in infrastructure.
""We hope the final product will enable and accelerate that shift"" to zero-emission vehicles, the company said.
Tesla's fast supercharging network has given it a competitive edge. Meanwhile, other carmakers have formed alliances or invested in startups for networks as they rush new EV entrants to market. EV sales made up only 2% of total car sale in the United States in 2020.
There are two kinds of public EV charging stations: the slower Level 2 chargers, which take about an hour of charging for 10 miles (16 km) to 20 miles (32 km); and the DC Fast chargers that can add 60 to 80 miles of range in a 20-minute charge.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) unit Electrify America, which will have 800 charging stations with more than 3,500 ultra-fast chargers across the United States, said it was encouraged by the spending plans.
Other companies such as Blink, EVgo and ChargePoint are also building out charging networks across the country, but at a much slower pace than their counterparts in China, where there is strong government support for EVs.
There are about 884,000 charging stations in China as of May compared to just about 42,000 in the United States.
A Cox Automotive study said Americans are hesitant to buy EVs due to anxieties about the ranges of the vehicles and high price tags, as well as weak charging infrastructure.

""It (the infrastructure) can give a push to people, but you have to differ between the people in the big cities and people on the countryside,"" automotive analyst Schwope said.
""On the countryside, you need much more mileage than in the cities. The push will come especially in the big cities.""

VANCOUVER (Reuters) -Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's request for a publication ban on new evidence her legal team received from HSBC has been denied by a Canadian court in her U.S. extradition case, a lawyer involved in the case said on Friday.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions. 
She faces a Canadian government extradition attempt on charges of bank fraud in the United States.
Canadian prosecutors had fought her request for a publication ban on documents relevant to her case received from HSBC via a court in Hong Kong. The documents were provided on the condition that Meng make a reasonable effort to keep them private.
The British Columbia Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the request, said Daniel Coles, the legal counsel representing a consortium of media outlets - including Reuters - who argued against the publication ban. 
The reasons for the denial were not made public, pending issues relating to a previous publication ban, Coles said.
Prosecutors representing the Canadian government had argued that ""to be consistent with the open court principle, a ban must be tailored"" and details should be selectively redacted from the public, rather than the whole documents.
Meng has been under house arrest in Vancouver for more than two years and fighting her extradition. Meng has said she is innocent.
Alykhan Velshi, vice president of corporate affairs at Huawei Canada, said in an emailed statement the company accepts the court's decision, adding that ""the truth in these documents can now come out.""
The Canadian government and HSBC were not immediately available for comment.

The open court principle requires that court proceedings be open and accessible to the public and to the media.

Furthermore, continued innovations in the treatment of critical diseases and an aging population should help many healthcare companies generate solid growth. So, we think it could be wise to add the following fundamentally strong healthcare stocks to one's portfolio: Bristol-Myers (BMY) and Agilent (A). Read on.The healthcare industry has received a great deal of attention in recent months thanks to the role it played so far in fighting COVID-19. While the pandemic is under control in most major economies, investors’ focus on the industry is not expected to decline anytime soon given the relatively inelastic demand for healthcare products and services, an aging population and the continued efforts of several companies to find cures or treatments for critical diseases.
Investors’ interest in the healthcare sector is evident in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) and iShares Global Healthcare ETF’s (IXJ) 12.3% and 10.6% returns, respectively, over the past six months. Adding to the positives, in his recently unveiled fiscal 2022 budget proposal, President Biden requested $133.7 billion for the department of Health & Human Services (HHS) budget, which represents a 23% increase beyond this year’s budget.

(Reuters) -A human rights group that attracted millions of views on YouTube to testimonies from people who say their families have disappeared in China's Xinjiang region is moving its videos to little-known service Odysee after some were taken down by the Google-owned streaming giant, two sources told Reuters.
The group, credited by international organizations like Human Rights Watch for drawing attention to human rights violations in Xinjiang, has come under fire from Kazakh authorities since its founding in 2017. 
Serikzhan Bilash, a Xinjiang-born Kazakh activist who co-founded the channel and has been arrested multiple times for his activism, said government advisors told him five years ago to stop using the word ""genocide"" to describe the situation in Xinjiang - an order he assumed came from pressure from China's government on Kazakhstan.
""They're just facts,"" Bilash said to Reuters in a phone interview, referring to the content of Atajurt's videos. ""The people giving the testimonies are talking about their loved ones.""
Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights' channel has published nearly 11,000 videos on YouTube totaling over 120 million views since 2017, thousands of which feature people speaking to camera about relatives they say have disappeared without a trace in China's Xinjiang region, where UN experts and rights groups estimate over a million people have been detained in recent years.
On June 15, the channel was blocked for violating YouTube's guidelines, according to a screenshot seen by Reuters, after twelve of its videos had been reported for breaching its 'cyberbullying and harassment' policy.
The channel's administrators had appealed the blocking of all twelve videos between April and June, with some reinstated - but YouTube did not provide an explanation as to why others were kept out of public view, the administrators told Reuters.
Following inquiries from Reuters as to why the channel was removed, YouTube restored it on June 18, explaining that it had received multiple so-called 'strikes' for videos which contained people holding up ID cards to prove they were related to the missing, violating a YouTube policy which prohibits personally identifiable information from appearing in its content. 
Human Rights Watch also had alerted YouTube about Atajurt being blocked, MIT Technology Review reported on Thursday.
YouTube asked Atajurt to blur the IDs. But Atajurt is hesitant to comply, the channel's administrator said, concerned that doing so would jeopardize the trustworthiness of the videos. Fearing further blocking by YouTube, they decided to back up content to Odysee, a website built on a blockchain protocol called LBRY, designed to give creators more control. About 975 videos https://odysee.com/@ATAJURT:8 have been moved so far.
Even as administrators were moving content, they received another series of automated messages from YouTube stating that the videos in question had been removed from public view, this time because of concerns that they may promote violent criminal organizations.
""There is another excuse every day. I never trusted YouTube,"" Serikzhan Bilash, one of Atajurt's founders, told Reuters in a phone interview. ""But we’re not afraid anymore, because we are backing ourselves up with LBRY. The most important thing is our material’s safety.""
Bilash, who fled to Istanbul last year after suffering repeated threats and intimidation from Kazakh authorities when he refused to stop working with Atajurt, said his equipment including hard disks and mobile phones had been confiscated multiple times in Kazakhstan - making YouTube the only place where their entire video collection was stored.
YouTube said the messages relating to promoting violent criminal organisations were automated and not related to the creator's content, but the videos were being kept private to allow administrators to make edits.
'I FELT I'D LOST EVERYTHING'
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang. Many former inmates have said they were subject to ideological training and abuse in the camps. China denies all accusations of abuse.
YouTube in recent years has restricted more content amid increasing scrutiny on online cyberbullying, misinformation and hate speech. The policies have ensnared many channels, including those of far-right commentators, forcing them to seek haven on social media services such as Parler that tout more openness.
But Atajurt representatives fear pro-China groups who deny that human rights abuses exist in Xinjiang are using YouTube’s reporting features to remove their content by reporting it en masse, triggering an automatic block. Representatives shared videos on WhatsApp and Telegram with Reuters which they said described how to report Atajurt’s YouTube videos. 
They also pointed to multiple YouTube channels containing videos of Serikzhan Bilash’s face superimposed onto animals like monkeys and pigs which they said were denigrating Bilash’s character and work.
YouTube said channels are always welcome to move to alternatives. Its policies bar directing abusive attention by posting non-public personal information, such as names and addresses.
The service makes exceptions to some rules for videos that are educational, documentary or scientific - but Atajurt's videos did not meet these requirements to a sufficient level, according to YouTube.
“We welcome responsible efforts to document important human rights cases around the world,” the company said. ""We recognize that the intention of these videos was not to maliciously reveal PII ... and are working with Atajurt Kazakh to explain our policies.""
Odysee told Reuters that it welcomes and supports Atajurt. 
Atajurt plans to keep uploading to YouTube as long as it can.

“We will never delete it,” Bilash said, citing the importance of the service's big audience.
“The day YouTube deactivated our channel, I felt I’d lost everything in the world… the new channel does not have so many subscribers,” he said, “but it is safe.”

Ikonics, a 65-year-old company with imaging solutions as its mainstay, will become a subsidiary of the new company, and be positioned for sale.
TeraWulf will provide domestically produced bitcoin powered by more than 90% zero-carbon energy with a goal of utilizing 100% zero-carbon energy.
It expects to have 50 MW of mining capacity online this year, and consistent with its buildout plan, sees 800 MW mining capacity deployed by 2025.

By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Shares in U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) shed more than 4% on Thursday after hiring difficulties tempered its 2022 earnings forecast.
FedEx founder and CEO Fred Smith told analysts that operations at the Memphis-based company are being crimped by an inability to find enough workers. 
Widespread labor shortages are hitting FedEx in the form of ""higher wage rates and lower productivity, particularly in the (current fiscal) first quarter, and this is reflected in our overall outlook for the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Lenz said.
FedEx expects 2022 earnings, excluding items, of $20.50 to $21.50 - just ahead of analysts' average estimate of $20.37, according to Refinitiv data. Still, shares fell $13.31 to $290.38 in extended trading. 
Data from Convey Inc shows FedEx lags both UPS and the U.S. Postal Service when it comes to on-time deliveries. 
Staffing challenges ""contributed to recent service levels that do not meet our own high expectations,"" Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said. 
For example, failure to recruit package handlers sends overtime costs up and requires parcels to be routed away from regions with inadequate labor, Subramaniam said.
The firm recently suspended freight shipping for roughly 1,400 customers to help relieve pressure on its network - which has been running at near full tilt for much of the pandemic.
FedEx expects the labor situation to improve over the next two or three months as it starts preparing for the peak holiday shipping season, CFO Lentz said. 
The pandemic created so much demand for package delivery and freight services that FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) are turning away some business. 
That means customers means are less likely to push back when the carriers raise fees and add surcharges, said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold.
Still, Arnold said labor could continue to be an issue going into the holidays. 
FedEx also reported a slightly higher than expected increase in profit and revenue for the fourth quarter that ended May 31.
Adjusted net income nearly doubled to $1.36 billion, or $5.01 per share, from the year-earlier quarter. Revenue increased 30% to $22.6 billion. 

Analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of $4.99 per share and revenue of $21.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.
FedEx shares finished the regular trading session up roughly 150% from March 1, 2020 - some two weeks before U.S. states and jurisdictions began closing businesses to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday narrowed the scope of a class action lawsuit against  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) in which thousands of people sought damages after the credit reporting company flagged their names as matching some on a government list of suspected terrorists and drug traffickers.
The justices ruled in TransUnion's appeal of a lower court decision that had upheld a jury verdict against the Chicago-based company in the lawsuit and had ordered it to pay $40 million in damages. 
The 5-4 decision, authored by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, stopped short of tossing out the jury verdict, but found there was insufficient evidence to show that all of the plaintiffs had been harmed by TransUnion's conduct, meaning the amount of damages will be reduced.
There were 8,185 class members in the litigation whose names matched ones on the government list. At trial it was established only that TransUnion had revealed that information publicly on 1,853 of them. The other 6,332 did not experience a ""concrete injury,"" thus lacked the necessary legal standing to sue, Kavanaugh wrote.
""No concrete harm, no standing,"" Kavanaugh wrote.
On two other claims in the lawsuit, the court found, none of the plaintiffs aside from the lead plaintiff, a California man named Sergio Ramirez, could show they had suffered any harm.
""This outcome will have broad implications for class certification practice nationwide. It also will improve American businesses' ability to serve their customers and workers efficiently, with reduced litigation burden,"" said Stephen Newman, a lawyer representing TransUnion.
The business community has long sought to place limits on class action lawsuits, which can lead to big payouts to plaintiffs and their lawyers. TransUnion was backed in the case by business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as companies including The  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. 
""We are pleased that the court upheld a jury trial verdict for 1,853 class members falsely labeled as terrorists by TransUnion. We are disappointed by the fact that we did not prevail as to the entire matter, but we are reviewing the next steps in light of the complicated opinion,"" said Samuel Issacharoff, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
Credit reporting companies provide information on an individual's borrowing and bill-paying history to lenders and other businesses. TransUnion argued that the lawsuit, which focused on a federal law called the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires consumer reporting agencies to provide correct information, should never have been certified as a class action. 
TransUnion incorrectly identified Ramirez and other consumers as possible security threats. 
Ramirez sued in 2012 after an incident the previous year at a Nissan (OTC:NSANY) automobile dealership. When the dealership performed a credit check using TransUnion, the report noted that Ramirez's name appeared to partially match two names on a federal list of people barred from conducting business in the United States for national security reasons. Neither person was Ramirez.
Although his wife was able to purchase a vehicle, Ramirez said he was shocked and embarrassed. He canceled an overseas vacation over concern about the list. After requesting a copy of his credit file, TransUnion sent him a separate mailing stating that his name was matched with two on the list. 
The lawsuit noted that the mailing that mentioned the match incorrectly stated that such notification was not part of the credit report that creditors or employers would see. In fact, it was. TransUnion argued that merely being sent the mailings was not a concrete injury.

Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas joined the court's three liberal justices in dissent. Thomas wrote that ""despite Congress' judgment that such misdeeds deserve redress, the majority decides that TransUnion's actions are so insignificant that the Constitution prohibits consumers from vindicating their rights in federal court. The Constitution does no such thing.""
A jury in 2017 awarded damages of around $60 million to the class as a whole, including $52 million in punitive damages. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 upheld this verdict but reduced the damages to about $40 million.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) surged over 15% to a record high on Friday after the sportswear giant forecast full-year sales of more than $50 billion, riding on pent-up demand for sneakers and athletic gear from U.S. shoppers.
The company's fourth-quarter revenue also nearly doubled, topping $12 billion for the first time and overshadowing a weaker-than-anticipated performance in its fast-growing China market.
""The strong momentum in Nike's brand globally is more than offsetting pressure in China and supply chain constraints,"" Telsey Advisory analyst Cristina Fernandez said.
A rapid vaccination drive and the easing of restrictions in Europe and the United States have encouraged people to go on a shopping spree, unleashing demand for expensive items, including sneakers. 
Those factors helped Nike more than make up for weak China sales, which were hit by calls to boycott global brands for their comments around forced labor in Xinjiang.
Still, analysts are optimistic of a swift demand rebound in the region as company executives noted that sales trends in China for June were already reaching 2020 levels. 
""We're confident about what we're seeing in China ... We've been in China for over 40 years ... And today, we're the largest sport brand there,"" Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe said on Thursday. ""We're a brand of China and for China.""
At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets, with Stifel's $213 target the highest on the Street. The median target is $175.
Nike's shares were trading at $152.10, after hitting an all-time high of $154.18 earlier.

The jump also helped push the S&P 500 index to a record high, while lifting shares of German peers Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Puma about 6% and 2%, respectively.
""We are encouraged by increased certainty in the pace and strength of recovery, ... The worst is now behind (for Nike),""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Adrienne Yih said.

(Reuters) - A bipartisan $1.2 trillion U.S. infrastructure agreement would boost the rollout of electric buses, but falls way short of what transit experts and school districts say is needed to upgrade the country's bus fleet to battery power.
Under the plan outlined by the White House on Thursday, electric bus intiatives would receive $7.5 billion in funding. While the details are yet to be mapped out and any bill requires approval by Congress, the funding is significantly less than a measure proposed by President Joe Biden in March.
Under that plan, the EV market would have received a $174 billion boost, including a program to replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20% of the U.S. school bus fleet.
However, any funding marks a significant increase from the roughly $130 million the Federal Transit Administration spent on electric transit bus programs in 2020.
""We believe this plan will stimulate orders and will be great for our community, our workers and our country,"" said Frank Girardot, spokesman for the North American unit of China's BYD, which dominates the U.S. electric transit bus market, along with California-based Proterra Inc. 
BYD North America, however, is facing a ban on receiving federal funding by the end of this year under a U.S. crackdown on Chinese-owned companies.
Proterra declined to comment on the infrastructure deal.
Lion Electric Co, the leading electric school bus manufacturer, lauded the deal.
""Investing equally in charging infrastructure and vehicle deployment is a sound approach in scaling electrified school and public bus transit,"" the company said.
Converting transit buses to battery or fuel-cell power is considered one of the fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which at 28% accounts for the largest share of U.S. emissions. 
Of the country's roughly 70,000 transit buses, only around 2% are currently zero emission, according to the Center for Transportation and Environment (CTE), which advises transit agencies on electrification.
An even smaller share of the country's 480,000 iconic yellow school buses currently runs on battery power.
CTE researchers estimate it would cost between $56 billion and $88 billion to transition the U.S. transit fleet to zero emission buses.
Vehicle purchases account for roughly half of that cost, with electric buses costing an average of $887,000 - almost twice as much as a diesel bus, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NYSE:LH). Those higher upfront costs are recovered after around 3.5 years, thanks to cheaper operating costs, the government agency calculated.
Bus electrification also requires charging and at times grid infrastructure upgrades. Under the bipartisan proposal, EV infrastructure would receive $7.5 billion in funding, but it is unclear what, if any, share would go toward transit.

The Electric School Bus Coalition, which groups cities and utilities, said the proposed investment was insufficient.
""We welcome all federal investment to accelerate the transition from diesel to electric school buses, but our coalition is advocating for $25 billion,"" said John Hipchen, the group's executive director.

The company's shares surged as much as 40% to $56.40, their highest since February, after more than doubling in value this year.
The approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) comes at a critical time for Branson as his space venture faces off against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Bezos, Branson and Musk have been investing billions of dollars on their rocket startups. 
Branson, who is reportedly flying to space himself in a bid to beat rival billionaire Bezos to the final frontier, received the green light just a month after a successful test flight.
Virgin Galactic last month completed its first manned space flight from its new home port in New Mexico in May, as its SpaceShipTwo craft with a capacity of six passengers glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots.
The company has said it has more than 600 reservations for 90-minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket. 

""Today's approval by the FAA ... gives us confidence as we proceed toward our first fully crewed test flight this summer,"" Virgin Galactic Chief Executive Officer Michael Colglazier said in a statement. 
As of Friday afternoon, the company's stock was on track to post its biggest one-day gain in nearly five months.

(Reuters) - Foreign automakers are beginning to relax some COVID-19 protocols at their U.S. plants, including the wearing of masks, even as the Detroit-based carmakers and the United Auto Workers union continue to require workers to wear masks.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co, BMW AG and Geely's Volvo Cars all are beginning to let workers at some U.S. plants shed their masks as COVID-19 vaccinations continue to climb across the country. Some companies are requiring workers to provide proof of vaccination before they can go mask-free.
In the meantime, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV all said their workers must continue to wear masks. The decision was made jointly with the United Auto Workers (UAW) on June 9, when a joint task force agreed to continue most workplace protocols, except for temperature screening.
UAW spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said the task force is scheduled to meet again next week.
In a statement, GM said, ""We will continue to meet as an auto industry group to assess the situation, considering pandemic conditions, vaccination rates and the latest governmental guidance. We're hoping to be able to relax or rescind more COVID protocols over time.""
A Ford spokesperson said, ""Masks are required inside all Ford buildings at all times.""
A Stellantis spokesperson said, ""Our policy on masks has not changed. We will have to discuss any changes in protocols with the UAW before we implement.""
Toyota will begin to allow workers in July to shed their masks at a number of U.S. plants, but they must provide proof of vaccination.
Nissan no longer requires masks to be worn by workers who have been vaccinated, but proof of vaccination is required.
BMW is allowing vaccinated workers at its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant to shed their masks, and does not require vaccination proof.
Face masks are not required at Volvo Cars' Charleston, South Carolina, plant.

Hyundai Motor Co said vaccinated employees at its Southern California headquarters do not have to wear masks, and that it is still evaluating the mask policy for workers at its Alabama plant. Hyundai affiliate Kia is also evaluating the mask policy for its Georgia plant, where they are still required. 
Honda Motor Co's U.S. plants and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes factory in Alabama still require masks.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>","Toshiba shareholders oust chairman, in shake-up for Japan Inc","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp shareholders ousted the chairman of the board on Friday, delivering a powerful rebuke to the company after management was found to have colluded with the Japanese government to put pressure on foreign investors.
The unexpected removal of chairman Osamu Nagayama, a veteran of corporate Japan, and another director marked a clear victory for corporate governance, and sent a strong signal about overseas investors' ability to push through change even at one of Japan Inc's most storied conglomerates.
The board said it would undertake a full review of assets and devise a plan to create growth via dividends and buying back shares. It would also engage with potential investors, it said, comments that could spark tension with the government, which regards Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) as a strategic asset.
CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa was appointed as interim chairman, the company said, adding it recognised the seriousness of the rejection of the two directors.
""This result is a sign of a paradigm shift in Japan and will only embolden activist investors whether foreign or domestic,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.
Tsunakawa retook the helm in April after Toshiba's previous CEO left, but has said he does not plan to stay for too long. Ousters of board members at Japanese companies, particularly household names such as Toshiba, are extremely rare.
But supporters of Nagayama say his failure to win re-election will only set back Toshiba further, depriving the industrial conglomerate, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015, of an experienced leadership.
A breakdown of the vote was not immediately disclosed. 
The strategic review will be led by Paul Brough, a chartered account with experience in mergers and acquisitions as a financial adviser.
One Toshiba source, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said foreign investors had voted in greater numbers than in previous shareholder meetings as they saw it as an important test case of corporate governance in Japan. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
How the government responds has yet to seen, but so far Trade Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama has been unapologetic about his ministry's dealings with Toshiba, saying the policies it implemented were natural ones for the ministry to take.
Toshiba makes defence equipment and nuclear reactors and is strategically important to the government.
""In general the hope is that corporate governance can be improved through discussions with shareholders and at the same time we work to secure the stable development of businesses and technology that are important from a national security standpoint,"" he told a regular news conference ahead of the AGM.
On Thursday, Akira Amari, a former economy minister and an influential lawmaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, accused activist investors of focusing only on short-term profits and called for better monitoring of such investors to protect economic security. 
SHAREHOLDER REVOLT 
Shares in Toshiba closed down 0.6%. The stock has increased by around two-thirds in value this year, bolstered by a $20 billion bid for the company by private equity company CVC Capital. Although Toshiba has dismissed that bid, it has promised the strategic review.
Nagayama's ouster could help activist shareholders push the company to consider take-private offers. Since CVC's bid, event-driven hedge funds have been actively buying Toshiba shares, making the shareholder roster potentially more favourable for activists, investor sources have said.
Nagayama, who was seen as cautious about such offers, only joined Toshiba's board in mid-2020 after the alleged pressuring of foreign shareholders to vote in line with management's board nominees took place.
A former Chugai Pharmaceutical CEO and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp board director, he is well respected and both the electronics giant and former U.S. ambassador to Japan John Roos had expressed their support for him.
But his critics argued he should step down to take responsibility for the board's resistance to address the allegations. 
Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders not reappoint him, while 3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's Singapore-based No. 2 shareholder with a 7.2% stake, had called for his resignation.

3D Investment said in a statement after the result that it hoped the AGM marked the beginning of a new era and it looked forward to constructive, ongoing dialogue with Toshiba's board and management team.
Toshiba nominated 11 directors at the AGM, including Nagayama. Nobuyuki Kobayashi, a member of the audit committee, was also voted out.

Investing.com – Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) was up more than 1% during Friday’s trading on a Reuters report that said the embattled bank may seek a merger with its larger Swiss rival UBS (NYSE:UBS).
Credit Suisse's top management are under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan for the scandal-hit bank that could include a potential merger with rival UBS, Reuters said.
The bank's executives fear the flagship Swiss lender, left vulnerable by scandals, could be challenged by investors demanding its break-up, or that its shrinking stock-market value makes it a target for a foreign hostile takeover.
The bank has a market cap of $25.22 billion, approximately 28% off its 52-week high.
The Swiss bank has had to review its business after losing more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos. It faces a barrage of legal actions for helping clients invest $10 billion in bonds issued by collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
As of May 25, it had recovered $5.9 billion of the $10 billion Greensill bonds, it told investors on Tuesday.
Credit Suisse took a charge of 4.4 billion Swiss francs ($4.79 billion) in the first quarter on account of the Archegos fiasco.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp sold its stake in electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for about 400 billion yen ($3.61 billion) in the year ended March, a spokesperson for the Japanese company said on Friday. 
The sale comes as the bicycles-to-hair dryers conglomerate is seeking to reduce its dependence on Tesla and raise cash for growth investment. 
Panasonic's battery business is dominated by Elon Musk's Tesla, but the two firms have had a tense relationship at times. 
Panasonic bought 1.4 million Tesla shares at $21.15 each in 2010 for about $30 million. That stake was worth $730 million at the end of March 2020. The shares have gained almost seven fold since then and closed up 3.5% at $679.82 apiece on Thursday.
""The impact of crypto assets may have pushed Tesla's share price above its intrinsic value, making it a good time to sell,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. 
Musk said in February his firm bought bitcoin and would take payment in the cryptocurrency, a decision he later reversed, and his comments on Twitter drive swings in the price of such assets. 
While Panasonic gave financial backing to Tesla when it was smaller, the automaker's expansion means there's no need for capital ties, Yasuda added. Panasonic's shares closed up 4.9% on Friday in the biggest such move since January. 
The stake sale will not affect the partnership with Tesla, the Panasonic spokesperson said, and was made as part of a review of shareholdings in line with corporate governance guidelines.
The sale comes as the automaker is diversifying its own battery supply chain. 
Tesla has struck deals with South Korea's LG Energy Solution, a unit of LG Chem, and China's CATL, with Reuters reporting the latter is planning a plant in Shanghai near the automaker's production base. 

Panasonic said earlier this year it would buy the shares https://www.reuters.com/business/panasonic-says-it-will-buy-us-supply-chain-software-firm-blue-yonder-2021-04-23 of U.S. supply-chain software company Blue Yonder that it does not already own, in a $7.1 billion deal. Its biggest such deal in a decade, the price raised the eyebrows of analysts who pointed to the firm's spotty M&A track record.

Shares of the company were up 7.2% at $128 in morning trade on Friday, after it said retail used-unit sales doubled to 270,799 units in the first quarter.
Low interest rates, government stimulus and a preference for private vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic have bolstered demand at auto retailers.
Earlier in the month, the company said it would hire 1,800 employees by summer-end to boost production through reconditioning and preparing vehicles for sale.
""We benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments,"" Chief Executive Bill Nash said on a post-earnings call.
Comparable store units rose 99.1% from a year ago, partly helped by a shift in the timing of customer tax refunds.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a note that while online car seller Carvana remains the preferred used-car name, the brokerage thinks CarMax has the network capability to be a strong challenger to Carvana over the long run.
""We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used-auto ecosystem,"" Chief Financial Officer Enrique Mayor-Mora said.
Net income rose to $436.8 million, or $2.63 per share, in the quarter ended May 31, from $4.98 million, or 3 cents per share, a year ago.

Analysts on average expected the company to report earnings of $1.63 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s Merrill Lynch unit will pay nearly $11.7 million to resolve claims that it overcharged customers who invested in unit investment trusts, a U.S. regulator said on Friday.
The payout includes a $3.25 million fine and $8.44 million of restitution, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Merrill did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
A unit investment trust, or UIT, lets people invest in a onetime public offering in a portfolio of securities, typically stocks and bonds. Unlike a mutual fund, a trust matures on a specific date, and pays investors the proceeds from securities it held.
According to FINRA, Merrill failed to detect that between 2011 and 2015 its financial advisers sold $2.5 billion of their clients' UITs more than 100 days before the maturity dates, and used some or all proceeds to buy new UITs.

It said the early rollovers may have caused more than 3,000 customers to incur sales charges they would have avoided had they held their UITs to maturity. Many newly purchased UITs used the same strategies as the UITs that were sold, it added.
Bank of America spokesperson Alliccia Hernandez said Merrill addressed FINRA's concerns by enhancing its supervisory system.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 10:59AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Toyota-backed self-driving startup Pony.ai considers going public,"FREMONT, California (Reuters) - Self-driving tech company Pony.ai, backed by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, is considering going public in the United States to help fund its goal of commercializing driverless ride-hailing services, its chief executive told Reuters.
The startup, active in the United States and China, plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025, he said.
Self-driving startups such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cruise have been racing to raise capital as the industry prepares to scale up operations.
Still, beyond the time taken to address technological challenges and the massive cost of producing self-driving cars, the industry still has to persuade global regulators as well as the public as to the safety of full automation.
""For autonomous driving, it's a big opportunity. But at the same time, it's a long term, big opportunity,"" CEO James Peng said in an interview with Reuters.
""So it requires a long lead way for spending. That means all the autonomous driving companies need to raise enough funding to support their operations,"" he said.
The comments come as Pony.ai on Friday said it had tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), as chief financial officer to help ""accelerate its commercial growth and global deployment"".
""We're still debating and considering,"" said Peng, when asked about the time frame for a public share sale.
""It's just a different way of raising funds.""
ROBOTAXI
Pony.ai, founded by former Google and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) engineers Peng and Lou Tiancheng in 2016, has so far raised more than $1 billion, including $462 million from Toyota, valuing the startup at $5.3 billion as of late last year.
Earlier this month, it said it had begun driverless testing on public roads in California's Fremont and Milpitas ahead of the planned launch of a robotaxi service next year. It has also been testing driverless vehicles in Guangzhou, China. 

The firm has operated robotaxi services with safety drivers behind the wheel in some parts of China, as well as in Irvine, California. That has yielded diverse data which it could use to train its driver system and tap a talent pool in both countries, Peng said.
He said the next big challenge is to reduce manufacturing costs for driverless vehicles while expanding into more cities and regions and ensuring safety in different environments.

And given that the stock is overvalued at its current price, it implies notable downside risk in the near term. So, we think it’s best that investors avoid the stock for now. Read on.Electric vehicle charging equipment provider Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK), based in Hollywood, Fla., operates residential and commercial EV charging equipment in the United States. Its shares have risen 439% over the past nine months on the back of continued progress in the deployment of charging stations and optimism surrounding President Biden’s commitment to boost EV infrastructure.
However, BLNK’s stock price has declined 2.9% year-to-date and 16.2% over the past six months. In fact, the stock is now trading 35.7% below its 52-week high of $64.50, indicating short-term bearishness.
BLNK’s stock looks highly overvalued at its current price. Although the hype surrounding the EV charging industry has helped the stock gain 27.4% over the past month, BLNK has not yet been able to generate substantial profits. In addition to that, its weak growth prospects are a major concern, given the intense competition from established EV players in the market.

So, we believe these companies are better positioned to overcome the industry challenges and sail through than NIO. Read on for details.Driven by a shift in consumer trends toward electric vehicles (EVs) on growing environmental concerns, Chinese EV-maker Nio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO) has gained 562.7% over the past year. However, the stock has lost momentum over the past few months on investors’ concerns with the company’s financials. In its last reported quarter, NIO reported a RMB4,875.0 million ($744.1 million) net loss, and a RMB295.9 million ($45.2 million) loss from operations. This has cast a pall over the company’s future performance. Consequently, the stock has declined 6.7% so far this year. Although its shares have surged 23% over the past three months and 26.7% over the past month on the back of optimism surrounding the EV industry, we think NIO’s weak fundamentals could cause a pullback in the near term.
Also, a global semiconductor chip shortage continues to weigh heavily on the automotive industry and NIO’s vehicle delivery was adversely affected last month. While the automobile sector has benefited from increasing demand, a severe shortage of semiconductors is hurting vehicle manufacturers. However, some automakers have been able to expand their foundry capacity, find new suppliers, and make logistical adjustments to address the situation.
Established automakers Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (HMC), Isuzu Motors Limited (ISUZY), and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY) are examples. They are likely to experience a resurgence in sales because they are ramping up their capacity to combat the chip shortage. Since these companies have a lot of room to grow, we believe they are better bets than NIO now.

While Walkley believes the BlackBerry management has created a cogent long-term strategy and the business is turning the corner toward stronger trends, he said he awaits more proof on the execution front before becoming more constructive on the shares.
He listed execution on the new product roadmap, evidence of cross-selling opportunities emerging and growing overall software and services revenue as factors that would convince him for a relook of his view.
BlackBerry on Thursday reported its first quarter results for fiscal 2022.
Revenue declined but not as much as the Street had feared. It came at $174 million, falling 15.5% from the year-ago quarter. An average of analysts’ estimates had pegged it to come at $168.25 million.

Data from Refinitiv Lipper showed investors put a net $16.1 billion into U.S. equity funds in the week to Wednesday, the most since the week ended March 17.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 U.S. stock indexes scaled new peaks this week, with investors cheering data that showed record U.S. factory activity in June..
U.S. large-cap funds attracted a net $13.4 billion, their biggest inflow since January 2018, while mid-cap funds and small-cap funds lagged behind.
The data showed U.S. growth funds received a net $1.5 billion, while value funds faced outflows worth $2.4 billion. 
The higher inflows into growth stocks came as investors shifted their focus back to tech and other high-flying growth stocks as the allure of value stocks diminished after the Fed's hawkish tilt last week.
However, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said value stocks could regain the lead over growth stocks. 
""The forward price-to-earnings ratio of growth relative to value is at a post-dotcom bubble high, at close to a 1.8x premium,"" he said in a note.
""Simply stated, relative valuations for growth companies look vulnerable, especially if interest rates rise.”

(Reuters) -Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Global Inc's $4 billion initial public offering (IPO) received enough investor demand to clinch its targeted price range on Friday, vindicating a lowering of valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said.
The listing in New York, which will be the biggest U.S. share sale by a Chinese company since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised $25 billion in 2014, is expected to price on Tuesday, and the shares to start trading on Wednesday. 
Didi's indicated price range would give it a valuation of $62.4 billion to $67.2 billion. Didi was hoping it could command a valuation of as much as $100 billion, Reuters reported in March.
At the new valuation, Didi would be valued more like its U.S. peer Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, rather than Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and food delivery firm. 
Didi not respond to a request for comment on its bookbuilding exercise.
""Many investors still doubt if Didi can maintain a high growth rate for its core ride-hailing business in China,"" said a prospective investor at one Hong Kong-based hedge fund who asked not to be identified as he was not allowed to speak to media.
""Its market share is already very high in big cities, which means there is limited room for its future growth,"" the source added.
""It's also challenging for the company to expand in lower-tier cities due to increasing competition from rivals, not to mention the potential impact of a regulatory crackdown.""
Didi set a price range of between $13 and $14 per American Depositary Share (ADS), a regulatory filing showed on Thursday, and said it would offer 288 million such shares in the IPO. At the top of the range, the deal will raise $4.03 billion.
An overallotment option could see the company sell an extra 43.2 million shares to raise up to an extra $605 million.
Investor presentations, led by Didi's vice president and head of capital markets, David Xu, will run until Tuesday. The roadshow for a U.S. listing of this size is shorter than the usual 10 days of most.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management has indicated interest in subscribing for up to $750 million worth of stock in the IPO and Singapore's Temasek for $500 million, Didi's updated prospectus shows.
Last week, Reuters reported that China's market regulator had begun an antitrust investigation of Didi, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.
The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is investigating whether Didi used competitive practices that unfairly squeezed out smaller rivals.

It is also examining whether the pricing mechanism used by Didi's core ride-hailing business is sufficiently transparent. 
At the time, Didi said it would not comment on unsubstantiated speculation from unnamed sources.

Let’s discuss.Headquartered in Guangzhou, China,  Vipshop Holdings  Limited (VIPS) pioneered the online discount retail model in China, providing special offers and deep discounts on branded products. Leveraging its unique business model, its business has grown significantly over the past few years. Its revenue and EPS have grown at 13.2% and 47.2% CAGRs, respectively, over the past three years. However, its shares have been on a downtrend lately amid increasing regulatory pressures on its business in the United States and its home country.

Even though VIPS reported impressive financials for its first fiscal quarter (ended March 31, 2021), it provided only moderate sales guidance for the second quarter. The company said it expects its revenue to be between RMB 28.90 billion ($4.46 billion) and RMB 30.10 billion ($4.65 billion) in the second quarter.

(Reuters) -Britain's competition regulator started a formal investigation on Friday into whether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google may not have done enough to prevent or remove fake reviews.
Along with regulators in the United Sates and the European Union, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has stepped up its scrutiny of big tech firms in recent years. 
The British regulator said it will gather more information to decide if the firms may have broken consumer law by taking insufficient action to protect shoppers. Both Google and Amazon said they were continuing to assist the CMA.
CMA action last year over the trading of fake reviews resulted in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) removing groups and banning individuals for buying and selling fake reviews on their sites.
Google said on Thursday it would delay blocking tracking cookies on its Chrome browser following intervention by the CMA. 
The CMA started its investigation into reviews in May 2020, focusing on the internal systems and processes of several platforms for identifying and dealing with fake reviews.
The regulator said it was also concerned that Amazon's systems had failed adequately to prevent and deter some sellers from manipulating product listings, through for example co-opting positive reviews from other products.
""Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,"" the CMA's Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement.
""Equally, it's simply not fair if some businesses can fake 5-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.""
ENFORCEMENT ACTION
The CMA said it has not reached a view on whether Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google have broken the law.
However, if it concludes they have broken consumer protection law, it can take enforcement action ranging from securing formal commitments to change the way they deal with fake reviews or escalating to court action.
Amazon said it would continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries.
""We are relentless in protecting our store and will take action to stop fake reviews regardless of the size or location of those who attempt this abuse,"" said a spokesperson.

Google too said it would continue to work with the regulator.
""Our strict policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take action — from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts,"" a spokesperson for the company said.

Among equity sector funds, tech funds had inflows worth $1.4 billion, the highest in 10 weeks, while financial sector funds faced outflows worth $2.36 billion, the largest since March 2020.

Meanwhile, global bond funds had net buying of $3.5 billion in the week to June 23, which was the smallest in four weeks.
Inflows into inflation-linked bonds dropped to an eight-week low of $31 million.

However, global money market funds faced an outflow of $58.9 billion in the week, their biggest this year, which underscores a rise in risk sentiment this week.
Among commodity funds, precious metal funds faced net sales worth $215 million, while energy funds also witnessed outflow for fourth consecutive week.

An analysis of 23,735 emerging-market funds showed bond funds faced net selling worth $1.23 billion, marking the first outflow in four weeks, and equity funds had outflows of $183 million, compared with $1.5 billion worth of inflows in the previous week.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Friday, continuing the previous session’s positive tone, boosted by strong numbers from retail giant  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and agreement over an infrastructure package and ahead of key inflation data. 
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 115 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 27 points, or 0.2%.
The main equity indices surged Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing over 300 points, or nearly 1%, the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.6%, to a record high, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%, also another record high. All three indices are on course to post gains of over 2% this week.
Helping the tone was an announcement from President Joe Biden of a new deal on infrastructure, paving the way for fresh investment in roads, bridges and broadband internet. 
Biden’s bipartisan preliminary agreement is valued at $1.2 trillion over eight years, $579 billion of which is new spending, a lot lower than his original $2 trillion proposal. It also doesn’t include some of the more ambitious spending plans that particularly irked Republicans.
Also helping were strong results from sportswear retailer Nike after the close Thursday. The company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, and also forecast fiscal 2022 revenue would top $50 billion for the first time.
A busy week for Fedspeak comes to a close, with both Cleveland President Loretta Mester and Boston President Eric Rosengren set to make appearances. Ahead of their comments comes the release of the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
This is expected to show year-on-year gains of 3.4% in May, climbing from the 3.1% recorded the previous month, and way above the Fed’s nominal target of 2%.
Also due for release is the Michigan consumer sentiment index, 90 minutes later, and this is expected to climb to 86.4 in June, up from 82.9 the previous month.
Crude oil prices edged lower Friday, but are still heading for a fifth consecutive positive week ahead of next week’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.2% at $73.14 a barrel, while Brent was 0.2% lower at $75.41, with both contracts up over 2% so far this week and around 50% higher year-to-date. 
The latest weekly update from Baker Hughes of the number of U.S. oil rigs will be studied carefully, particularly with high crude prices making it more commercially viable for shale producers to reenter the market.
Additionally, the CFTC will release its weekly commitments of traders report, a guide on how the market is positioned.

The FSA had said Danske, which has been embroiled in a separate money-laundering scandal, had misinformed the market by facilitating ""wash trades"", in which the same person sells and buys securities, between Aug. 12, 2016 and Feb. 22, 2019. Such trades can create misleading prices for securities.
Danske said the preliminary charges were ""for two potential violations of the Market Abuse Regulation on the basis of inadequate monitoring of transactions in financial instruments and market manipulation as a result of certain self-matching trades"".
The charges were brought by the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime.
Danske's chief compliance officer, Philippe Vollot, said: ""The bank did not have adequate market monitoring in place, and we have therefore since 2019 made significant investments to strengthen our trade surveillance, our systems and controls and have also implemented strengthened pre-trade controls."" 
Vollot said the bank, which was ready to cooperate with the prosecutor, had ""not seen any indication of intentional wrongdoing or any harm to customers or market participants.""
The violations can be punished by fines.

Separately, Danske is being investigated by authorities in several countries after more than 200 billion euros ($239 billion) in suspicious transactions flowed through its Estonian branch from 2007 to 2015, in one of the world's biggest money-laundering cases.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian prosecutors investigating the deadly collapse of a bridge in 2018 have asked for 59 people, including former Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci, to be sent for trial, two judicial sources told Reuters.
The road bridge, operated by Atlantia's motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia, collapsed in the port city of Genoa on Aug. 14, 2018, killing 43 people and laying bare the dire state of Italy's crumbling infrastructure.
Prosecutors have also asked for Autostrade and engineering unit SPEA to be sent for trial. The 59 defendants include former SPEA boss Antonino Galatà and former transport ministry officials, the sources said. 
Autostrade and SPEA declined to comment. The ministry and lawyers representing Castellucci and Galatà did not respond to requests for comment.
The court will now set a date for the start of preliminary hearings, at the end of which a judge will decide whether to accept the prosecutors' request.
Managers at Autostrade and SPEA allegedly did not properly check the state of the bridge and did not correct serious issues that started to emerge only a few years after the viaduct opened in 1967, according to a document on the prosecutors' findings seen by Reuters.
Prosecutors claim the lack of maintenance was aimed at saving money and ensuring profits for the companies' shareholders.
The charges brought against the defendants include homicide, forgery and malicious omission of precautions to prevent disasters. The criminal code provides for a maximum sentence of 15 years.
Castellucci, who was behind Atlantia's international expansion, was ousted from the group in late 2019 after 13 years at its helm.
Under Italian law, firms can be held responsible for their employees' actions. Convictions for the companies could lead to fines and increase risks over legal claims in civil courts.
The prosecutors have decided to exclude from the trial request 10 suspects, on which further assessments and investigations will be carried out, the sources said.
Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family, earlier this month agreed to sell its 88% stake in Autostrade to Italian state lender CDP to end a dispute with the government sparked by the 2018 disaster.

Autostrade, which also counts German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) among its investors, runs half of Italy's 6,000 km (3,730 miles) of toll roads.
Three other investigations into allegations of falsified road safety reports, improper installation of anti-noise barriers and poor upkeep of road tunnels on Autostrade's network will be wrapped up by the end of the summer, the sources said.

Investing.com – FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares were down 4% in Friday’s premarket trading as the company’s outlook for the ongoing fiscal year came in below the Street’s estimate.
It forecast fiscal 2022 earnings per share of $18.90 to $19.90, lower than the average estimate of $20.37, according to Refinitiv data.
FedEx founder and CEO Fred Smith told analysts that operations at the company are being crimped by an inability to find enough workers.
Companies in the U.S. have had to hike wages to attract labor for meeting booming consumer demand but many are still complaining of not enough workers being available.
Widespread labor shortages are hitting FedEx in the form of ""higher wage rates and lower productivity, particularly in the (current fiscal) first quarter, and this is reflected in our overall outlook for the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Lenz said in a call to analysts, Reuters reported.
FedEx was recently forced to suspend its freight shipping guarantees for roughly 1,400 customers to help relieve pressure on its network - which has been running at near full tilt for much of the pandemic. This was mostly owing to labor shortage.
Staffing challenges ""contributed to recent service levels that do not meet our own high expectations,"" Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said in the call to analysts.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Facebook rejects talks with Australia publisher, may test online law","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's competition watchdog is looking into a claim that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) refused a publisher's request to negotiate a licensing deal, the regulator told Reuters, setting the stage for the first test of the world's toughest online content law.
The Conversation, which publishes current affairs commentary by academics, said it asked Facebook to begin talks as required under new Australian legislation that requires the social media firm and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to negotiate content-supply deals with media outlets.
Facebook declined without giving a reason, The Conversation said, even though the publisher was among the first in Australia to secure a similar deal with Google in the lead-up to the law in 2020.
The knockback could present the first test of a controversial mechanism unique to Australia's effort to claw back advertising dollars from Google and Facebook: if they refuse to negotiate licence fees with publishers, a government-appointed arbitrator may step in.
In a statement responding to Reuters questions, Facebook's head of news partnerships for Australia, Andrew Hunter, said the company was ""focused on concluding commercial deals with a range of Australian publishers"".
Hunter did not answer specific questions concerning The Conversation, but said Facebook was planning a separate initiative ""to support regional, rural and digital Australian newsrooms and public-interest journalism in the coming months"", without giving details.
""If Google's done a deal with them, I can't see how Facebook should argue that they shouldn't,"" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), said in an interview.
""The question of designation might need to come into play,"" he noted, using the term for assigning an arbitrator.
Under the law, the decision to designate a Big Tech firm for intervention was made by the treasurer, which is advised by the ACCC, noted Sims, but ""an absolute 'no' for an organisation that should be getting a deal is something we'll look into.""
The Conversation was ""exactly what we had in mind with the Code"", he said, although the situation had some way to play out before any further action would be taken.
Governments around the world are introducing laws to make the tech giants compensate media companies for the links that drive readers - and advertising revenue - to their platforms. But Australia is the only country where the government may set the fees if negotiations fail, a factor that drove Facebook to block newsfeeds in the country just before it was passed.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who earlier this year negotiated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over the laws, was not immediately available for comment. 
""SCRATCHING OUR HEADS""
Since the law took effect, a handful of the country's biggest media players, from News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) to the Australian Broadcasting Corp, have struck deals with the tech giants.
But some small and independent publishers whose content helps draw four-fifths of Australia's 25 million population to the Facebook site said the law had created a two-tier industry where rival titles that were owned by large parent companies secured deals while others missed out.
Nelson Yap, publisher of Australian Property Journal, which is on a government register of media businesses covered by the law, said he was in early discussions with Google but had emailed Facebook twice with no response.
He said he read Facebook's public statements about talking to publishers and ""I'm sitting here going, with whom? Not with us. Despite reaching out, we haven't heard anything. We're all scratching our heads, trying to work out what to do next.""
A Facebook spokesperson did not answer a question about any contacts with the Property Journal. Country Press Australia, a regional newspaper industry group, said it was holding constructive talks with Facebook on behalf about 140 publishers.
The Conversation editor Misha Ketchell said that ""obviously we are disappointed that we haven't been able to engage in negotiations with Facebook so far, but we remain optimistic that we will be able to reach an agreement"".

The ACCC's Sims said the deal pipeline had ""gone quieter than I would have envisaged"" but urged smaller publishers to be patient.
""On the one hand I'm concerned that people aren't getting a response to the emails, on the other hand I have seen it before and then things change and deals get done,"" he said.

The company also forecast fiscal 2022 revenue will topg $50 billion, more than analysts’ estimate of $48.46 billion, according to Refinitiv.
Nike's digital sales boomed and so did its membership model, as consumers bought more sportswear, shoes and comfortable clothing. The Jordan brand also continued to resonate with its fans.
Net income for the quarter ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $790 million and a net loss per share of $0.51.
Revenue rose 96% to $12.3 billion and was 21% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the last quarter before the start of the pandemic.
Operating overhead expense increased 16% to $2.7 billion as wage-related expenses weighed and the company invested more in technology.
Pointing out to continuing strong demand, the company said its inventory at the end of May was down 7% from a year ago.
Nike’s optimism is in line with what its rivals, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Puma, have also outlined.
At Adidas (DE:ADSGN), net income from continuing operations is projected to increase to a level of between 1.25 billion euros and 1.45 billion euros ($1.48 billion and $1.72 billion) from 461 million euro in 2020.

Several Canada Goose peers, including Versace, Michael Kors and Gucci, have recently decided to go fur-free, while apparel makers  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Gap are looking to make their products more sustainable to cater to eco-conscious shoppers.
Canada Goose, known for its $1,000 parkas, will also stop buying fur by the end of this year. It had in 2020 unveiled plans to introduce reclaimed fur into its supply chain.

Canada Goose's website, however, says it still uses natural down in jackets, even as PETA alleges the down industry uses painful methods to kill geese for making jackets.

The company will allow all users in the United States to shop at major 13 retailers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), by this fall, just ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season, intensifying competition in the sector's biggest market.
""This functionality will be materially incremental to volume and frequency over time in the U.S.,"" said Tim Piper, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Analysts also said that Afterpay's revenue and margins would get a boost from the move, with fees and interchange revenue likely to reach 7% of the transaction, compared with the 4% fee it charges merchants currently. 
""Further, given the non-network merchants can only be accessed through the app, it increases consumers' engagement with the Afterpay app which in our view could unlock further monetisatiion opportunities in the future,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.

Siegel heads the Tokyo office of law firm Morrison & Foerster and has worked on some of SoftBank's biggest deals. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis urged https://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-group-corporate-governance-idCNL3N2NQ095 shareholders to oppose his election due to his professional ties to the conglomerate.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa-based retailer Steinhoff said its half-year core earnings rose by 7%, as demand for value lines and a focus on home furnishings offset the impact of pandemic restrictions.
During Steinhoff's October to March reporting period many countries in Europe tightened restrictions or re-imposed lockdowns which hit its in-store operations and trading hours.
Despite this, Steinhoff said on Friday that its total revenue from continuing operations rose 4% to 4.497 billion euros ($5.37 billion) in the period, from 4.342 billion euros. 
""Individual businesses, such as Pepkor Africa and Pepco Group, with their everyday value focus, continued to perform robustly,"" Steinhoff said in a statement.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s top management are under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan for the scandal-hit Swiss bank that could include a potential merger with rival UBS, three people familiar with its thinking told Reuters.
The bank's executives fear the flagship Swiss lender, left vulnerable by scandals, could be challenged by investors demanding its break-up, or that its shrinking stock-market value makes it a target for a foreign hostile takeover, those people said.
New chairman, Antonio Horta-Osorio, announced a strategic review in late April, telling investors he would take time in reaching hard decisions that lay ahead. 
The bank's senior management are due to meet next week, one source said, while another person with knowledge of the matter said top executives wanted to examine restructuring proposals in early July. 
The Swiss bank has had to review its business after losing more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos. It faces a barrage of legal action for helping clients invest $10 billion in bonds issued by collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
The bank's shares have dropped by more than a quarter since early March, when its problems with Greensill were exposed.
""Credit Suisse needs a merger deal right away,"" a person with knowledge of the bank's thinking told Reuters.
""There is growing concern in Zurich that activist investors will go after them if they stand still."" 
Some executives have debated steps such as spinning off its local Swiss bank to prepare the rest of the business for a merger, pruning back investment banking or selling its asset management business, two of the people said.
A third said selling the U.S. investment bank was also an option.
Management discussions on any restructuring are preliminary and while they are in full swing, no decisions have yet been taken, the people said.
Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. 
The bank's management needs a new-look Credit Suisse, as its standing with customers and in Switzerland hits a low ebb.
In April, Swiss supervisor FINMA said it had opened enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse following Archegos and that it would investigate risk management shortcomings.
Swiss regulators are exasperated with what they see as the bank's freewheeling culture, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Credit Suisse's shrunken market valuation makes it worth a fraction of some of the big Wall Street banks, which have also been touted as potential suitors.
But any U.S. takeover would not be well received in Switzerland. Relations between Swiss banks and Washington were damaged when the United States pressured them into giving up their strict secrecy code more than a decade ago. 
'DISAPPEAR IN FOREIGN HANDS'
A merger with UBS would be more palatable, the people said. 
""The Swiss establishment is aware that without a domestic merger Credit Suisse will disappear in foreign hands,"" one of the sources said.
But the combination of Credit Suisse-UBS would have a dominant position in the Swiss market, a concern for regulators who could also demand that a combined group bolster its capital.
Credit Suisse could split out its Swiss bank to address competition concerns, one source said.
Credit Suisse-UBS would have workforce of more than 110,000 and a market value of more than $85 billion.
Earlier this year, when asked about a tie-up with Credit Suisse, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers threw cold water on the idea, saying he preferred ""organic"" growth. 
Any M&A deal for Credit Suisse would mark the end of a national icon, founded to finance the country's pan-Alpine railways and central to Switzerland's transformation from a farming nation to financial powerhouse.
In early trading on Friday, Credit Suisse shares were up 2.8% while UBS shares were down 0.2%. Credit Suisse also got a boost after the Federal Reserve stress tests found capital levels at its U.S. arm would withstand a severe economic downturn.
For such a flagship, the Swiss may prefer a home-grown solution to the prospect of a takeover by a foreign bank. 
A cross-border merger would be complicated because it would be unclear whether Switzerland or another host country would have control.
UBS, for instance, held merger talks with Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in 2019 but they fell apart in the face of Swiss opposition, said another person familiar with the matter. The two banks declined comment on this. 

Deutsche CEO Christian Sewing has expressed interest in participating in European bank mergers.
But many people who spoke to Reuters for this story, however, believed a deal between Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse was unlikely.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica considers suing GrandVision over $8.6 billion deal -source,"By Claudia Cristoferi
(Reuters) -Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica is considering suing its takeover target GrandVision after a court ruled that the Dutch eyewear retailer had violated the terms of their 7.2 billion euro ($8.6 billion) proposed acquisition agreement, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian spectacles giant, announced the bid for GrandVision in July 2019, aiming to control the Dutch eyewear group's more than 7,000 outlets across the world.
But the planned deal has since been at the centre of a legal battle between the two sides, with EssilorLuxottica arguing that decisions made by GrandVision during the COVID-19 pandemic could give grounds for ending its proposed takeover.
On Monday, an arbitration court ruled that GrandVision had breached obligations of the takeover agreement, which meant that EssilorLuxottica was no longer bound to the pact.
""The outcome of the arbitrage has confirmed what EssilorLuxottica has said all along: that the management of GrandVision has been engaged in a scheme that broke not just the spirit but also the material terms of the contract governing a 7 billion euros transaction,"" said the source, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential.
""The next step is for Essilux to prepare for legal action against GrandVision and its management, seeking damages consistent with the scale and importance of the transaction they have undermined,"" the source told Reuters on Thursday, declining to quantify the damages that EssilorLuxottica may seek. A spokesperson for EssilorLuxottica, formed in 2018 from the merger of French lens maker Essilor with Italian frames champion Luxottica, declined to comment on Thursday.
GrandVision spokesperson Annia Ballesteros declined to comment. 
EssilorLuxottica had said after the Dutch arbitration court ruling that it was reviewing its options, including walking away from the bid.
However, analysts and industry observers say it may try to renegotiate the deal at a lower price, given a strong strategic rationale for the deal and the fact that antitrust clearance had already been obtained. 
GrandVision, majority-owned by Dutch investment firm Hal Trust, has in the past accused EssilorLuxottica of simply looking for a way out of the deal. On Monday, it said it was disappointed by the arbitration court's ruling, which followed two earlier losses for the Franco-Italian company in a Dutch court case.
The arbitration court ruled that GrandVision had breached agreements by suspending payments to store owners and suppliers and by applying for state aid during the pandemic, without seeking EssilorLuxottica's approval.

EssilorLuxottica has won all necessary regulatory approvals for the planned takeover and started the sale process of some optical stores in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium to meet European antitrust requirements, a second source said, confirming earlier media reports.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - For a group of interns, Hong Kong's pro-democracy newspaper Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily proved to be a work experience they will never forget.
When the interns were less than three weeks into the job, 500 police officers raided their newsroom and arrested five executives as part of a national security investigation that has intensified fears over press freedom in the global financial hub.
On Thursday, the popular newspaper ended its nearly three-decade run, forced to close with its owner in jail and company assets frozen, leaving it unable to pay its approximately 600 journalists.
It was not the start of a career the interns had hoped for.
""My parents asked me to quit the internship after the senior executives were arrested,"" said Cherry, 21, who nevertheless defied her parents to stay on until the end. 
Cherry, who did not want to be identified by her full name because of the sensitivity of the matter, said she felt sadness and torment over the paper's demise.
""I wanted to stay in Apple Daily my whole life. From intern, to part-time, then to full-time ... Working at Apple Daily is not just a job, it is like a mission,"" she said.
Owned by staunch Beijing critic and jailed democracy activist Jimmy Lai, the 26-year-old newspaper was a popular tabloid that mixed pro-democracy discourse with celebrity gossip and reports critical of Chinese Communist leaders.
Lai, 73, has been a thorn in the side of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government for years. Authorities have accused him of colluding with foreign forces, including calling for sanctions in defence of the pro-democracy movement.
Beijing's main office in the city, the Liaison Office, has called him a traitor in statements. Lai is in jail on charges of illegal assembly, related to last year's democracy protests.
'BE CAREFUL'
The paper's closure is a dark moment for media in the former British colony, press advocacy groups say. Officials in Hong Kong and China have repeatedly said media freedoms are respected but are not absolute.
Five other interns who spoke to Reuters on condition they not be fully identified described their anguish but also the support of parents as they joined a company in the firing line of authorities under a tough national security law Beijing imposed on the city last year.
Polie, 21, said her mother had rushed into her bedroom the morning the newsroom was raided last week to tell her the news.
""They were not exactly worried, but sad. They were sad to see Hong Kong like this, sad to see me like this.""
Venus, 20, said her parents were worried about her internship and asked her not to put her byline on articles.
""They didn’t scold me, they just reminded me to be careful.""
For Ng, 21, working at the Apple Daily had been a childhood dream come true.
""If I didn't get the internship at Apple Daily, I wouldn't apply to any other organisation,"" she told Reuters.
""There won't be a paper better than Apple Daily for reporting the truth.""

Kenji, 22, on his second internship at the paper, said his passion for journalism was fading as the future for Hong Kong's media appeared ever more gloomy.
""I might not be a journalist in future,"" Kenji said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing's planned $4 billion New York debut will supercharge Chinese listings in the United States on the back of an all-time high in the first half the year, despite political sparring between the two countries. 
A total of 29 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Chinese companies in the United States in the first six months of the year raised $7.6 billion, the highest amount ever for that time period, according to Refinitiv data.
That was significantly higher than the $1.9 billion worth of listings in the same time period last year when Chinese firms were more cautious about uncertainties over the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The rush of listings happened despite continued political tension between the two countries under President Joe Biden, and the looming threat of U.S. kicking out Chinese companies if they fail to meet auditing standards.
""The Chinese equity story is still appealing to international investors, whereas the U.S. valuation and international fund raising opportunities are just as appealing to the Chinese issuers,"" said Ivy Wong, chair of law firm Baker McKenzie's Asia Pacific capital markets practice.
""Having contemplated the audit requirements coming into play for quite some time, it doesn't seem that the investors' appetite has changed nor the issuers' appetite to list and raise funds from U.S. listings has changed.
There are now 10 companies with public filings to list in the United States, the largest being Didi which is aiming to raise $4 billion for a valuation of more than $60 billion. The 29 listings so far in 2021 compares with just 13 at the same time last year, according to the data.
The Biden administration has pressed on with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in December, which is aimed at removing Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges if they fail to comply with American auditing standards for three years in a row.
The biggest Chinese listing in the United States so far this year was Full Truck Alliance, sometimes referred to as ""Uber (NYSE:UBER) for trucks"", which raised $1.6 billion earlier this week. E-cigarette company RLX Technology followed closely behind, raising $1.4 billion in January.
Didi is expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO this year. 
The share sale, which will price on Tuesday, will also be one of the biggest by any Chinese company in the United States since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised $25 billion in 2014.
ASIA-PACIFIC ECM
The level of equity capital markets (ECM) activity across Asia so far this year, following a record 2020, has surprised dealmakers.
There has been $250.6 billion worth of equity capital market deals in the Asia Pacific, including Japan, in the first half of 2021, up 70.7% compared with the same time last year, Refinitiv data showed. 
""On the back of a global recovery, we expected to see a sustained level of activity, but we didn't foresee activity up 90% year-on-year,"" said Alex Abagian, Co-Head of Asia Pacific ECM at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), using a figure that excludes Japan and China A-shares.
""That is extraordinary on the back of a very strong 2020.""

Technology deals accounted for 24% of Asia IPOs in the first half and the prospect of more emerging in the second half remains strong, according to Refinitiv data.
""There are still tech companies looking to come to list in Hong Kong in the second half of this year, or the early part of next year, so tech is still a big theme,"" said Peter Cheng, partner at law firm Deacons.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) -El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said in a national address on Thursday that a recently passed law making bitcoin legal tender will take effect on Sept. 7, noting that its use will be optional.
El Salvador's Congress already approved Bukele's proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency, making El Salvador the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.
""The use of bitcoin will be optional, nobody will receive bitcoin if they don't want it... If someone receives a payment in bitcoin they can choose to automatically receive it in dollars,"" said Bukele.
Salaries and pensions will continue to be paid in U.S. dollars, said Bukele, without specifying if that included salaries paid to state workers and private sector employees.
Earlier in the day Athena Bitcoin said it plans to invest over $1 million to install some 1,500 cryptocurrency ATMs in El Salvador, especially where residents receive remittances from abroad.
According to Athena Bitcoin's website, the ATMs can be used to buy bitcoins or sell them for cash.
""One of the reasons we passed the bitcoin law is precisely to help people who send remittances,"" said Bukele, adding the high costs of commissions traditionally associated with sending money home would be eliminated by using the cryptocurrency.

El Salvador relies heavily on money sent back from workers abroad. World Bank data showed remittances to the country made up nearly $6 billion or around a fifth of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, one of the highest ratios in the world.
Less than 1% of the volume of global cross-border remittances are currently in cryptocurrency, according to Kenneth Suchoski, U.S payments and fintech analyst at Autonomous Research. But in the future crypto is expected to account for a larger slice of the more than $500 billion in global annual remittances.

The benchmark S&P 500 reached new peaks, while the dollar held a retreat and benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were little changed at 1.49%.
U.S. President Joe Biden struck a bipartisan $579 billion infrastructure deal on Thursday, which aims to create millions of jobs. The move is expected to move through Congress alongside a separate bill that would spend trillions more on what Biden called “human infrastructure” that is opposed by the Republican party.
The group of senators “has come together to forge an agreement that will create millions of American jobs and modernize our American infrastructure,” Biden added.
An MSCI Inc. gauge of global stocks is expected to record its best week since April, thanks to the continuous economic recovery from COVID-19. Investors remain optimistic despite risks such as higher inflation, the prospect of tightening monetary policy, and the spread of more infectious COVID-19 variants.
“Infrastructure spending strengthens an already very strong economic growth outlook,” LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder told Bloomberg. These investments will “bolster the outlook for corporate profits and should keep this bull market going strong well beyond 2021.”
On the central bank front, the Banco de México unexpectedly increased its interest rates for the first time since late 2018, while the Bank of England warned against “premature tightening” as the economy still needs support to recover from COVID-19, as they headed down their policy decisions on Thursday.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 08:46PM ET</span>","Banks clear Fed stress test; paving way to boost buybacks, dividends","By Pete Schroeder and David Henry
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Large banks will no longer face pandemic-era restrictions on how much they can spend buying back stock and paying dividends, the Federal Reserve announced Thursday after finding the firms would remain well capitalized in its latest stress test.
The central bank said the test https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-dfast-results-20210624.pdf found 23 of the largest firms would suffer a combined $474 billion in losses under a hypothetical severe downturn, but that would still leave them with more than twice as much capital required under Fed rules. As a result, the Fed will lift limits on buybacks and dividends it had put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The results were met by a sigh of relief on Wall Street, where firms had been limited on what they can pay out to investors. Analysts expect banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will be able to pay out more than $100 billion together over the next four quarters.
The severity of losses under the test will be a factor in setting new capital requirements for each firm and setting boundaries for future dividends and share buybacks.
The Fed said it expects banks to wait until after markets close at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Monday to announce dividends and capital plans.
Bank stocks moved little in after-hours trading following the Fed's release, and Christopher Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott, said Wall Street had been expecting the news.
""A year ago the Fed saw a lot of uncertainty and really wanted the banks to have an abundance of caution,"" Marinac said. ""It is now time to release the extra capital and let the banks go back to the new normal.""
Banks suffered heavy losses in the test, which saw the hypothetical jobless rate surge to 10.75%, the stock market lose over half its value, and the economy contract by 4% driven by particularly heavy losses in commercial real estate. But even then, the Fed said overall bank capital ratios only fell as low as 10.6%, more than twice the regulatory minimum.
Of the banks tested, HSBC's American operations saw its capital levels fall to the lowest level, dropping to 7.3%, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s U.S. operations saw the highest capital level of 23.2%.
Thursday's results support Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles's stance that banks have performed well during the pandemic and as the economy reopens will be able to operate from a position of strength.
“Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has run three stress tests with several different hypothetical recessions and all have confirmed that the banking system is strongly positioned to support the ongoing recovery,” said Quarles in a statement on Thursday.
The banking industry hailed the results.
“This reasonable return of excess capital will support the economy as we build a strong and broad recovery,” said Kevin Fromer, head of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the nation’s largest banks.

The Fed had to upend its testing process in 2020 to account for the coronavirus pandemic. The rapid onset of lockdowns in a bid to contain the virus led to an economic downturn that outpaced in many ways the Fed's prepared June test. Instead, the Fed had to add more severe scenarios to its June exam and tested banks a second time in December to ensure they were weathering the pandemic.
The Fed imposed the extra payout restrictions one year ago after finding banks overall suffered heavier losses under its pandemic-informed analysis. The central bank then began to step those back in December when banks posted stronger results, allowing firms to begin buying back stock alongside paying dividends, while still capping their size.

LONDON (Reuters) -Visa Inc said on Thursday it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink, months after it ditched a planned acquisition of the startup's U.S. rival Plaid.
Founded in 2012, Sweden-based Tink enables banks and other financial firms to share and access consumer financial data more easily. It is used by more than 3,400 banks and other institutions, as well as over 250 million customers in Europe.
Visa (NYSE:V) terminated a planned $5.3 billion deal with U.S. data-sharing platform Plaid in January, following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the deal on antitrust grounds.
European Union rules on open banking require banks to allow access to customer data by registered third party providers to boost competition.
The rollout of the rules has provided fertile ground for fintechs, such as Tink, which provide technology to help third parties and banks to access customer data.
Some financial technology experts said the Tink acquisition could face antitrust concerns, similar to the failed Plaid deal.
""Europe is a very different open banking market to the USA,"" said Simon Taylor, head of ventures and co-founder at fintech consultancy 11:FS. ""But Tink is one of the largest players, and many of the concerns that led to the investigation into the Plaid-Visa deal may apply here."" 
The deal is part of Visa's push to diversify revenues beyond credit card payments, where it is one of the world's dominant players. Card companies have been facing increased pressure from regulators on fees, especially in Europe.
If completed, the transaction could mark another success for Sweden's financial technology startup sector which has created several large companies over the past few years. 

Buy now pay later company Klarna was valued at $46 billion in its latest fundraising round earlier this month, while Payments startup iZettle was acquired by  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) for $2.2 billion in 2018.
""With Tink and iZettle, Sweden has now produced two of Europe's largest ever fintech M&A exits,"" said Josh Bell, general partner at Dawn Capital, a venture capital firm who backed both firms.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As the world tries to price the cost of climate change, Japan's second largest non-life insurer MS&AD foresees the potential rise in claim payments in 2050 to be anywhere between 5% to 50% from current levels.
Sompo Holdings, the No. 3 non-life insurer, also plans to announce a similar estimate in August but with plenty of caveats, its officials say.
Others, including industry leader Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, are wary of even producing estimates, citing a lack of data.
""We know our analysis isn't perfect,"" said Yasumasa Kanie, manager of MS&AD Insurance's sustainability section.
""But there may never be a correct answer. It's better than nothing.""
The wide range produced by MS&AD illustrates the difficulty of pricing climate costs, and underscores the challenge financial institutions face in meeting pressure by investors for more disclosure.
Calculating climate costs is no easy task even for Japanese insurers, armed with sophisticated models to predict the course and intensity of typhoons, and the damage they could cause.
""We have experience estimating payments for insurance sold during a particular year,"" said Hiroo Shimada, deputy general manager at Tokio Marine's sustainability division.
""But doing scenario analysis without clarity on how climate could change 50 years from now, and how that could affect the number of typhoons that hit Japan, is a different story."" 
STRESS TESTS
Japanese regulators are still learning their way in setting rules on disclosure, lagging their counterparts in countries like Britain and France who have already announced plans to conduct stress tests incorporating climate risks.
Domestic financial institutions were thus allowed to go slow. But that is changing as Japan joined its Group of Seven counterparts this month in backing moves to force banks and firms to disclose their exposure to climate risks.
Among the world's most disaster-prone countries, Japan is already seeing a surge in heavy rain, typhoons and flooding, which the government has blamed partly on climate change.
Total damage by flooding hit a record 2.2 trillion yen ($19.8 billion) in 2019. Unprecedented torrential rain in southern Japan last July flooded 13,000 hectares of land, costing non-life insurers 106 billion yen in payments.

The government estimates that average temperatures in Japan will rise by up to 4.5 degree Celsius towards the end of this century, which could double or quadruple the number of floodings.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda warned that climate change could exert an ""extremely large impact"" on the economy, when announcing last week the bank's plan to boost funding for fighting climate change.
While the need for disclosure appears imminent, various factors make insurers, including those in Europe and the United States, wary of doing so.
Among them is the difficulty of modelling the impact of rising temperatures on cash flows for such a long timeframe, as well as a lack of uniform, comparable global rules on what assumptions they can base their projections on.

GLOBAL STANDARDS
Policymakers have urged companies to use recommendations made in 2017 by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). But the TCFD itself warned that more tools, data and methods must be developed for climate-related scenario analysis to work for a broader range of industries.
Setting global standards could turn out to be a complex and controversial process that could take years, as climate change affects countries in different ways, analysts say.
Europe has suffered heat and drought, while Australia and some U.S. states like California have been hit by wildfires.
In Japan, flooding caused by typhoons and heavy rain make up roughly 70% of all natural disasters, and is partly why MS&AD's analysis is based on the impact of typhoons.
""I'm really surprised MS&AD has decided to disclose its analysis,"" said Eiji Kubo, director at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings Japan.

""Even now, one or two typhoons could abruptly increase losses to the scale of 100 billion yen,"" he said. ""When it's so hard to predict costs several years from now, what's the point trying to come up with projections for 2030 or 2050?""

While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 40%, investors should look at more undervalued stocks like Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC (NASDAQ:SMTX)), Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD), and  Amkor Technology  (NASDAQ:AMKR).One of the major stories over the past couple of months is the semiconductor shortage. This has been a persistent problem for a variety of industries such as computer hardware, automakers, and home appliances.
According to Susquehanna Financial Group, semiconductor lead times have increased to 18 weeks from 13 at the start of the year. Another indication of tight supply is many companies raising prices with the latest example being Taiwan Semiconductor increasing prices by 20%. 
While the tight supply conditions of the chip industry have negative implications for many industries, it’s certainly positive for chip stocks. We’ve already seen impressive gains in many names as the VanEck Vectors Semiconductors ETF (SMH) is up 14.5% since mid-May, while one of the leading chip companies - NVIDIA (NVDA) is up by more than 40%.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 07:22PM ET</span>","Apple banks on physical stores as economies reopen, retail chief says","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expanding retail operations as the United States emerges from the pandemic, betting that a combination of strategies developed before and during COVID-19 will make its stores more popular than ever, its retail chief told Reuters. 
Apple is doing this as the retail industry works out what the post-pandemic future will look like, including consumers who have become used to ordering almost everything online. 
For Apple, the answer is keeping what helped it through the pandemic, and doubling down on its pre-pandemic strategy of in-store events and experiences beyond shopping. 
The express counters that popped up to help customers more efficiently pick up online orders, for example, will become regular features of Apple's 500-plus stores around the world, all of which have reopened as of June 14. 
The iPhone maker is also adding a new ""Creative Studios"" program, starting in Los Angeles and Beijing, that aims to teach young people from underrepresented communities to use Apple products to create music, films and photography. That adds to a broader array of classes based out of the stores designed to bring in customers in contact with Apple more frequently. 
""We're looking at this moment right now as a way to really begin again, and begin again in every way,"" Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people, told Reuters as the company prepared on Thursday to open a new store at the renovated Tower Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, Apple's second new U.S. retail outlet since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Apple boomed during the pandemic, hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization in August 2020 and setting records for sales of iPhones and several other categories. 
One of the retail-related weak spots in its financial results, analysts said, was a slowdown in sales of AppleCare, a device insurance plan that is often an upsell during a store visit but easier for consumers to skip online. Apple also experienced supply chain missteps over the past year, delivering its iPhone 12 later than usual last year and saying in April that the global semiconductor shortage would cost it several billion dollars in sales.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
Part of Apple's retail success amid closures was streamlining its buy-online, pick-up-in-person process. Apple's long-held retail strategy has been to encourage customers to wander its airy stores to touch and feel its devices. 
During the pandemic, Apple re-worked many stores to have small express counters designed to facilitate pickups quickly but still give a personal touch, sometimes by following up online or by phone later to set up devices. 
""The goal was really for speed, which is very different than what we usually experience in a retail store,"" O'Brien said. ""We want to make sure that in that experience that they can come in, quickly get the product they want. But we do want to make sure that we can also have a quick conversation with them to make sure that they have everything they need."" 
As local rules allow, Apple is returning to in-person events and classes at its stores. The ""Creative Studios"" effort will eventually roll out to other major cities, O'Brien said. 

Carolina Milanesi, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, said programs like those, in addition to courses designed to teach computer coding and other tech skills, are ways for Apple to bolster its brand with consumers between purchases.
“The more they can get you to use the device, the more engaged you are, the more loyal you’re going to be,"" Milanesi said.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes closed at record highs on Thursday, with the Dow also jumping almost 1% after U.S. President Joe Biden embraced a bipartisan Senate infrastructure deal.
With massive fiscal stimulus helped the U.S. economy grow at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, investors have been banking on an infrastructure agreement that could steer the next leg of the recovery for the world's largest economy and fuel more stock gains.
Construction and mining equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and aerospace firm Boeing (NYSE:BA) both jumped more than 2%, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Fueling the S&P 500's gains more than any other stock, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rose 3.5% after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said he would list SpaceX's space internet venture, Starlink, when its cash flow is reasonably predictable, adding that Tesla shareholders could get preference in investing.
Mega-caps PayPal and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) each gained more than 1%, and were also among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added 0.5% and ended with a market capitalization above $2 trillion for its first time.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to 411,000 for the week ended June 19, the Labor Department said on Thursday, but were still higher than the 380,000 that economists had forecast.
The Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 6.4% rate last quarter, unrevised from the estimate published in May.
So far this month, the S&P 500 growth index has climbed almost 4%, outperforming the value index's 2% drop.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.2 billion shares, less than the 11.0 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 technology, healthcare and communication services sector indexes hit record highs.
So far in 2021, the S&P 500 has gained almost 14%, beating the Nasdaq's 11% rise.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co jumped 7.3% to a record high after the drugmaker said it would apply for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval for its experimental Alzheimer's drug this year.
In response, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), which received a controversial approval for its Alzheimer's drug aducanumab earlier this month, tumbled 6.1%.
MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International rose 2.2% after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) upgraded the casino operator's stock to ""buy"" from ""hold.""
Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc gained 2.1% after the IT consulting firm raised its full-year revenue forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 105 new highs and 27 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration said Thursday it banned U.S. imports of a key solar panel material from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co, but stopped short of imposing a ban on all imports of silica from Xinjiang and said the action would not harm U.S. clean energy goals.
The Commerce Department separately added five Chinese entities to the U.S. economic blacklist over forced labor allegations in Xinjiang -- including Hoshine. The White House cited the G7's recent pledge to clean up the global supply chain as part of its actions.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the import bans on polysilicon and solar products made with forced labor would not hamper the Biden administration's clean energy goals.
""Our environmental goals will not be achieved on the backs of human beings in a forced labor environment,"" Mayorkas said at a press briefing. ""We're going to root out forced labor wherever it exists.""
The import ban covers products made overseas that use Hoshine materials, including any solar panels produced abroad with polysilicon from Hoshine. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, reacting to earlier reports of the U.S. action, said on Thursday that China would take ""all necessary measures"" to protect its companies' rights and interests. 
Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an interactive investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry's reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and the impact on its business would be limited.
Asked whether the Hoshine ban could be expanded into a region wide ban on all polysilicon from Xinjiang, Mayorkas and CBP officials downplayed any similarities to the agency's recent region-wide import bans on Xinjiang-produced cotton and tomato products over forced labor.
Ana Hinojosa, CBP's executive director for trade remedy law enforcement, said any expansion would depend on the substantiation of evidence that forced labor is being used.
Hinojosa said CBP identified $6 million of direct imports from Hoshine and $150 million of downstream products using Hoshine materials over the past 2.5 years. 
The United States is also restricting U.S. exports of ""commodities, software, and technology"" to Hoshine, three other Chinese firms and the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the western Chinese region.
Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat active on trade issues, said the announcement was an ""important signal of the administration's intent to enforce the law and as a first step."" He said he expects other companies in Xinjiang producing silica will likely be subject to further enforcement actions.
The White House said the entities' practices ran counter not only to American values but also tipped the scales against U.S. workers ""by exploiting workers and artificially suppressing wages.""
John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main U.S. solar industry association, said the group fully supported the Biden administration's move. 
""The fact is, we do not have transparency into supply chains in the Xinjiang region, and there is too much risk in operating there,"" Smirnow said. 
Polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter with Germany-based Bernreuter Research said the CBP order could have a broad impact on the U.S. solar industry, noting that the world's top eight polysilicon manufacturers, which produced more than 90% of the solar-grade polysilicon output in 2020, have all been mentioned by Hoshine as customers. 
""That means they source at least some of their silicon metal needs from Hoshine. Solar panel importers into the U.S. have to prove that the polysilicon for their panels was not made with any silicon metal from Hoshine,"" Bernreuter said.
The Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics said in a report on Thursday that China accounts for nearly half the global production of polysilicon.
'PROVE IT'
The new measures are the latest in a series of steps under President Joe Biden to secure U.S. supply chains in the face of allegations of rights abuses in China, and also the growing economic challenges posed by the United States' top geopolitical rival. 
Beijing has dismissed accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang as lies.
The three other companies added to the Commerce Department's blacklist were Xinjiang Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ) Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based manufacturing giant East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co, part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd.
Several of the companies are major manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon used in solar panel production.
Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, in an email to Reuters, said it had ""zero tolerance"" towards forced labor, and does not directly sell or buy from the United States so there would be no ""significant impact"" on its business.
The other companies or their parent firms, including XPCC, did not reply to requests for comment, or could not be reached.

Separately, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to the full Senate on Thursday. Proposed by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, the bill - should it become law - would ban all products from Xinjiang unless importers could show they were not produced with forced labor.
""This is slavery. Simple as that,"" Rubio told the committee. ""American companies argue that their supply chains are clean, and what this bill says is: prove it.""

(Reuters) -Nike Inc on Thursday forecast fiscal full-year sales ahead of Wall Street estimates, betting on its online business, higher demand as lockdowns ease, and its tried-and-tested strategy of limiting stock for popular products.
The sneaker maker's shares rose nearly 13% after the bell as the company also posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue.
After staying at home for more than a year and limiting themselves to leisure-wear and comfortable pajamas, consumers are back to buying sneakers for running and hiking as they return to their routines, thanks to rapid vaccinations.
There were definite reasons for optimism and confidence, like the return to sport, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said on an earnings call, adding that  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) has already begun to see an acceleration in its sport performance business. 
Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said fiscal 2022 revenue is estimated to grow by low double-digits and surpass $50 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $48.46 billion for fiscal 2022, according to Refinitiv.
First-half growth is expected to be slightly higher than second half growth, Friend said.
In Nike's biggest market, North America, fourth-quarter revenue more than doubled to $5.38 billion and beat the average analysts' estimate of $4.31 billion.
Total gross margin rose 8.5 percentage points to 45.8% versus last year, boosted in part by the company's direct to consumer business and fewer charges related to factory cancellations. Analysts expected gross margin of 43.96%, according to Refinitiv. 
In China, a fast-growing market for the company, revenue of $1.93 billion missed expectations of $2.22 billion.
Nike and several other apparel companies like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and H&M were attacked on Chinese social media in March after internet users found statements the companies had made on the use of forced labor in Xinjiang.

Net income came in at $1.51 billion, or 93 cents per share, for the quarter ended May 31, compared with a loss of $790 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from a year ago, when the pandemic was at its peak. Analysts were expecting revenue of $11.01 billion and earnings of 51 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican inspectors have rejected three pork skin cargos at the U.S.-Mexico border since April from the biggest U.S. pork plant operated by industry giant Smithfield Foods as well as another shipper, the country's health safety agency told Reuters.
In Mexico, pork skins are mostly used to make chicharrones, a popular fried delicacy found in a variety of dishes, from tacos to soups. The skins are not as prized by American consumers, underscoring the complementary nature of the binational pork trade. 
Mexico was the biggest export market for U.S. pork by volume before being surpassed by China in 2020. 
After notifying U.S. authorities of the tainted skins, Mexico's health safety agency, Senasica, requested on June 16 that Smithfield's Tar Heel, North Carolina, facility's export license be revoked. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the suspension on Monday.
Last year, the plant exported 41,000 tonnes of skins, bacon and other pork products to Mexico, and this year through May another 24,000 tonnes, according to government data.
Smithfield, owned by Hong Kong-listed WH Group (OTC:WHGLY), said the issue is not related to Smithfield or the facility, but is due to a third party company. It said in a statement that authorities are working to resolve the matter.
Senasica said the third-party shipper was Rava Forwarding Inc, which also became ineligible to export from a cold storage facility in Laredo, Texas, on June 18. 
Any resumption in shipments from either facility will likely take at least a few months, according to Senasica's press office. 
Smithfield's Tar Heel plant - the world's largest - can slaughter more than 34,000 hogs daily, about 7% of U.S. capacity, according to industry estimates.
Senasica's decision to prevent further exports from the Smithfield and Rava facilities was based on the ""accumulation"" of tainted cargos of refrigerated pork skins.

Specifically, an April 15 rejection from the Tar Heel plant came after inspectors observed rotting product covered with ""yellowish spots."" Two subsequent rejections in June, which may have included a mix of product from both facilities, revealed more of the spots as well as fungus outbreaks. 
Rava could not immediately be reached for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) Inc on Thursday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by John Melendez, known by his alter ego Stuttering John, claiming it illegally exploited his celebrity on channels dedicated to radio and television host Howard Stern.
Melendez, who left Stern's radio show in 2004 and became the announcer for NBC's ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" sought unspecified damages last August in accusing Sirius of using his name, persona and voice from old recordings without permission to add listeners and sell advertising.
U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan ruled, however, that federal copyright law preempted Melendez's claims that Sirius violated his publicity rights under California law.
Crotty also said Melendez, despite more than 15 years and an estimated 13,000 hours on ""The Howard Stern Show,"" did not show he was injured or that Sirius illegally used him to promote its services, including channels not dedicated to Stern.
""The commercial advantage Sirius gains from playing the HSS Archives and running the advertisements flows from the rebroadcasting of the copyrightable sound recordings themselves, not from Melendez's identity,"" the judge wrote.
Crotty dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.
Melendez will likely appeal, his lawyer Michael Popok said in an email, after Crotty ""adopted a unique analytic framework which we believe is inconsistent with prevailing law.""
Sirius and lawyers for the New York-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stern was not a defendant.
Melendez has had a speech impediment since childhood.
Stern dubbed him Stuttering John, and he became known for asking impertinent questions to people like the actor Billy Crystal, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and the Dalai Lama.

Melendez left Stern's show just before Stern moved it to Sirius from nationally syndicated radio.
The case is Melendez v. Sirius XM Radio Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06620.

The bill, led by Senator Ben Cardin, provides a production tax credit of $15 per megawatt hour for existing nuclear plant owners or operators in states such as New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania which have deregulated power markets. Cardin's state, Maryland, has two reactors at  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC)'s Calvert Cliffs plant. 
Nuclear reactors are virtually emissions-free, but have been struggling to compete with power generation fueled by natural gas, and wind and solar power. The United States has 93 reactors, down from 104 in 2012, as rising security and safety costs put additional pressures on the business.
The bill, if passed by the Senate and House, could help President Joe Biden, who has also supported a production tax credit for nuclear plants, in his goal to put the country on a path to decarbonize the power grid by 2035.
“America needs to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels, so it is imperative that we keep these reactors operating safely while we continue to work on demand reduction, renewables, energy storage, and transmission grid resiliency,"" Cardin said in a release. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, also introduced the legislation. 

The credit would be phased out for any market revenues above $25 per megawatt hour or after 10 years.
Exelon has said it will close two nuclear power plants in Illinois in coming months if the state does not come through with subsidies. It was not certain whether the U.S. bill could help prevent the closures.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>",BlackRock plans more employee support after review of complaints,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday the company would create new support channels for employees and start evaluating the conduct of senior leaders, including himself, after a legal review of intolerant behavior at the world's top asset manager. 
Fink described the steps in an all-hands memo following a review by the law firm of Paul, Weiss that was led by partner Loretta Lynch, a former U.S. Attorney General. 
The review came after employees complained about racial and sexual harassment, and the conduct of executives, in a series of reports this spring. 
In a Feb. 1 Medium post, for instance, a former BlackRock analyst described being sexually harassed and discriminated against as an Arab-American Muslim woman, including being taunted for not wearing a Christmas holiday sweater. Little happened after she complained to human resources, she wrote.
With some $9 trillion under management, BlackRock is an influential voice pushing for more boardroom diversity and minority representation at portfolio companies. 
BlackRock's changes were reported earlier on Thursday by Bloomberg News. 
The law firm's review ""highlighted things I wasn’t happy about. These included instances where people at BlackRock had experiences that did not meet what we all should expect of BlackRock,"" Fink said in his memo, provided by a BlackRock spokesman. 
BlackRock declined to discuss individual cases, citing privacy. 

Fink said BlackRock would make changes including ""expanding options for employees to engage on issues that do not warrant a formal complaint"" and investing in its human resources team.
To reinforce the message, Fink also said he and another top 25 or so executives going forward will undergo reviews from peers ""to ensure we have a clear picture of how the conduct of each of our senior leaders impacts everyone we work with.""

With that, prominent shipping companies ZIM Integrated (ZIM) and Kirby (NYSE:KEX) should see a decent recovery in the coming months. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM) is an Israel-based company that provides shipping and logistics services worldwide. The company offers multi-modal, cargo handling, tariff management, schedule information, and other related services, such as shipping agencies, storage, distribution, forwarding and land transportation.
Kirby Corporation (KEX) in Houston, Tex., operates a fleet of inland tank barges. The company transports industrial chemicals, refined petroleum products, black oil products, and agricultural chemicals. It also overhauls and services diesel engines employed in marine, power generation, and rail applications.
A near halt in industrial activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in demand for the shipping of bulk goods and commodities. The gradual resumption of industrial activities globally this year has been reviving that demand, however. Furthermore, to remain competitive in this digital era, the industry has been adopting technology solutions for tracking shipments, safe packaging and storage, thus providing an even faster and more efficient service to customers.

Thus, we think the recent price dips have created a perfect opportunity to invest in fundamentally sound semiconductor companies Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), United Microelectronics (UMC), Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC (NASDAQ:SMTX)), and ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (IMOS). So, let’s pore over these names.The demand for semiconductors has increased substantially over the past year due to the increasing use of electronic devices, the sharpening focus on the electrification of vehicles, and growing tech integration in virtually every industry. However, with production slowing during the initial days of the pandemic, the whole world has been facing an acute shortage of semiconductors.
Governments worldwide and industry titans have been taking steps to accelerate the supply. President Biden’s $50 billion investment plan to boost the U.S semiconductor industry, along with the initiatives by other leading semiconductor producing countries, should be able to ramp up the supply to meet the increasing demand. Also, South Korea recently announced its plan to invest $452 billion in the industry over the next nine years. And Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, has responded to the shortage by increasing its capital spending budget to $28 billion in 2021. These investments and robust market demand should drive the semiconductor industry’s growth. The industry is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR over the next five years.
We think this sector's growth potential should allow stocks Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Semtech Corporation (SMTC), and ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (IMOS) to rebound in the near term and continue rallying thereafter.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs riding a wave of economic optimism as President Joe Biden announced a nearly $600 billion infrastructure pact, the fate of which depends on the success of a much larger package that has drawn strong opposition from Republicans. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to record intraday high of 4,266.50 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1%, or 322 points, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.7% having hit an all-time high of 14,369.71 intraday.
“We have a deal,” Biden told reporters Thursday. “I think it’s really important we’ve all agreed that none of us got all that we wanted.”
The deal didn’t include the more ambitious initiatives including spending to expand child care and education and was much lower than the $2.3 trillion package touted by Biden earlier this year. The infrastructure bill will only be passed alongside a much larger package  -- expected to be funded by tax hikes -- that would focus spending on “human infrastructure,"" according to Biden. The much larger infrastructure package has a narrow window of passage in Congress through the reconciliation process without the support of Republicans. There isn't much room for error as Democrats hold a slender majority.  
Ahead of the announcement House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't introduce the infrastructure bill until the second larger bill was prepared.
The upgrade to critical infrastructure is widely expected to boost productivity and ultimately economic growth.
Cyclical areas of the market, which benefit from stronger economic growth, added to gains with financials leading to the upside.
Financials were also helped by a jump in banking stocks ahead of the Federal Reserve's stress test results due later Thursday, which could pave the way for a massive wave of capital return to shareholders.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) closed higher, with the latter up nearly 3%.
Tech, meanwhile, was helped by a bid up in chip stocks even as some warn there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel just yet for the supply shortage in chips. Flex, the world’s third-biggest chipmaker, said the lack of supply is likely to last until at least mid-2022.
With the exception of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), megacap tech was mostly up with Microsoft adding to its $2 trillion market cap. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed higher. 
The record day on Wall Street was driven by a broad rally with most sectors - baring real estate and utilities - racking up gains. But this is an aberration from the ongoing rotation into value from growth or vice versa. The rotation doesn't point to a market that sees plenty of room for upside.  
""While the S&P 500 has drifted to new highs, this market has felt less overwhelmingly bullish and more rotational,"" Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts.com told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday. ""So I think the last couple of months have been certainly rotational ... which is probably more a sign of a topping market than a healthy bull market."" 
Still, the current technicals for the broader market are in place for the rally to continue at least in the short term. 
In the coming weeks, if the S&P 500 holds above its ""50-day moving average, which is currently around 4,190 on the S&P 500, and previous lows from earlier this month in June which are around 4,160 and 4,170, I think we're in good shape,"" Keller added. ""But if we start to break those support levels, then the character of the market can change very, very quickly once people start to see things roll over."""

Gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 850 basis points to 45.8%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to require Big Tech platforms to choose between running a platform and competing on it, wrapping up two days of votes that saw the approval of four measures directly aimed at reining in the power of some of the country's most successful companies.
The bill passed the committee on a vote of 21-20.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, said the bill was needed because the tech giants had not played fairly. ""Google, Amazon and Apple each favor their own products in search results, giving themselves an unfair advantage over competitors,"" he said.
In other votes on Wednesday and Thursday, the committee approved bills to prohibit platforms like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) from disadvantaging rivals who use their platform and to require big tech companies contemplating mergers to show that they are legal, rather than requiring antitrust enforcers to prove that they are not. It also approved a measure to require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere 
Asked about the package of bills, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said there was concern in both parties about the tech giants. ""This legislation attempts to address that in the interest of fairness, in the interest of competition, and the interest of meeting the needs of people whose privacy, whose data and all the rest is at the mercy of these tech companies,"" she said.
There has been opposition to the anti-tech measures from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Amazon, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, and there is no certainty that any of them will become law.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concern about the toughest legislation in the package.
The committee also voted to increase the budgets of the agencies enforcing antitrust law. A companion measure has passed the Senate. And the panel passed a bill to ensure that antitrust cases brought by state attorneys general remain in the court they select.

Consequently, we believe it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound stocks Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Micron (MU) because they are currently trading at discounted valuations.Increasing reliance on tech products and solutions and rapid digitization have fueled the demand for semiconductors over the past year. According to The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor industry sales rose 6.5% year-over-year to $439 billion in 2020. However, a current global chip shortage caused by exponential growth in demand has negatively impacted the production and sales of many industries, especially electronics and automotive.
Governments and corporations from the world over have been investing heavily to revive the industry. President Biden has proposed to invest $50 billion in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing and research and development under the CHIPS for America Act to meet the needs of domestic companies and help the U.S. become a world leader in chip technology. The global semiconductor market is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR over the next seven years to hit $803.15 billion by 2028. Thus, most semiconductor stocks have the potential to thrive.
This favorable backdrop should help leading chip manufacturers Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), and Micron Technology Inc.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government will speak to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) about its apparent decision not to allow older people to return as grocery packers, after they were removed to protect them from the coronavirus, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday.
Some 35,000 Mexicans, most between 60 and 74 years old, packed groceries at Walmart's stores and other chains in Mexico through a government-backed volunteer program, earning just tips, before the pandemic.
The program, already criticized by labor activists, was suspended https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mexico-elderly-idUSKBN2171IC by Walmart de Mexico in March 2020 amid concerns about the workers' vulnerability to coronavirus. 
In recent days, workers have protested outside the National Palace in Mexico City where Lopez Obrador resides, demanding the president urge Walmart to bring them back to their posts. 
""It's a matter of talking to them. Many times things are resolved with dialogue, with communication,"" Lopez Obrador told his morning news conference when questioned on the subject.
Walmart de Mexico told Reuters it had informed the government's National Institute for Elderly People (INAPAM), which oversees the initiative, in December 2020 that it would not be continuing the program. 
It added that protecting the health of workers and shoppers was a priority. 
""Due to the health contingency, we've seen that our clients try to keep third-parties from having greater contact with the merchandise they buy,"" the company said in a statement. 

The company did not comment on Lopez Obrador's remarks. 
Many older adults in Mexico are forced to work even after retiring after a lifetime of work because the pensions they receive are not enough to cover their needs.

With billions of dollars at stake, the ruling could escalate the dispute if Eni decides to take the matter to international arbitration. Eni has warned that a rushed decision could impact Ghana's appeal to foreign investors. 
Kevin Okyere, founder and chief executive of Springfield, told Reuters that the company has asked the court to preserve revenues from the field that produces over 50,000 barrels of oil per day until a deal is done and ""each gets their share"". 
""They are in production and are taking profits in which we are entitled to half of, that is why we took legal action to protect our interest,"" Okyere said, adding that a combination could see it hold around 54% stake. 
The adjacent fields, Eni's Sankofa and Springfield's Afina, are located offshore Ghana.
A spokesperson for Eni said the company, and partner Vitol, have argued that there were no basis for Springfield's Afina discovery to be considered commercially producible, and an order to combine them was premature.
Sankofa, which has been producing oil since 2017, is part of Eni's Offshore Cape Three Points project off the Atlantic Coast. Eni says the project has reserves of about 500 million barrels of oil and 40 billion cubic meters of unassociated gas.
Springfield says Afina, discovered in 2019, holds 1.5 billion barrels of oil and about 19.8 billion cubic meters of gas. 
Oilfields that straddle each other are required to combine in order to reduce production costs. It is for that reason that Tullow and Kosmos partnered up to develop Ghana's flagship Jubilee field, which began production in 2010. 
Okyere said Springfield took the matter to court because Eni had engaged in delaying discussions, despite a directive from the energy ministry last year for the fields to be combined. He said Eni had not showed up for their meetings.
Eni's spokesperson said it had been in discussions until Springfield took the matter to court to force it to comply with the energy ministry directives.
""This caused a stall in discussions among parties. At the moment, Springfield is still vigorously pursuing this court case, which creates an impediment to any fruitful discussions with the companies on the subject,"" Eni said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure framework does not contain new money for electric vehicle rebates but would spend $15 billion to boost EV charging stations and buy electric school and transit buses, the White House said in a fact sheet.
President Joe Biden proposed $174 billion on electric vehicles, including $100 billion on electric vehicle consumer rebates. Democrats in Congress still plan to seek funding for EV rebates in other legislation this year. The funding would ""accomplish the president’s goal of building 500,000 EV chargers"" and ""electrify thousands of school and transit buses across the country,"" the White House said.
Both General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc have hit the manufacturer cap and no longer qualify for consumer $7,500 EV tax credits.
Previously, Biden had sought $15 billion for EV charging stations, The plan also calls for $20 billion for electric school buses and $25 billion for EV transit vehicles.
The fact sheet says the measure could be funded by various ways including sale of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but it does not offer a precise figure. Another funding method would be to reinstate Superfund fees for chemicals.

The deal dropped two funding ideas that had been considered: a per mile fee on electric vehicles and indexing gasoline taxes to adjust for inflation.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc appears to have extended its drive to repurchase its own stock, even with its share price near a record high, according to regulatory filings and an analyst.
Edward Jones & Co analyst James Shanahan estimated that buybacks have totaled about $5.15 billion between April 22 and June 22, and about $6.46 billion in the second quarter, based on Berkshire's average share price during the applicable periods.
Berkshire did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment.
Buffett has aggressively repurchased Berkshire shares as high stock market valuations and the growth of special purpose acquisition companies, which take private companies public, made buying whole companies appear expensive.
""It's a killer,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's May 1 annual meeting, referring to SPACs.
Berkshire repurchased $6.6 billion of stock in the first quarter, and a record $24.7 billion in 2020.
Its last major acquisition was a $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016. Berkshire ended March with $145.4 billion of cash and equivalents.
""There could be deal frustration,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst with a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire. ""Share buybacks also reflect confidence in one's stock.""
Berkshire may discuss buybacks in its financial report for the second quarter, likely in early August.
On Wednesday, Buffett donated more than $4.1 billion of his Berkshire stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities.
The donations left him with a 15.8% stake in his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, regulatory filings show.
That stake suggests Berkshire's share count has been dropping, based on reported shares outstanding as of March 31 and April 22, according to another regulatory filing.
The dollar amount of any buybacks depends on what price Berkshire paid. Through Wednesday, Berkshire's share price was down 7% from its early May record high.
Repurchasing stock ""offers a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses,"" Buffett wrote on Feb. 27 in his annual shareholder letter.

Berkshire owns several dozen businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Shanahan said Berkshire's cash hoard may have declined since March, based on the company's investment activity and ability to generate free cash flow. He rates Berkshire a ""buy.""

608,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>","U.S. Labor Board prosecutor hopes to bulk up staffing, budget as gig worker scrutiny grows","By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top prosecutor at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the U.S. agency that investigates unfair labor practices, is pushing for a bigger budget and more staff, he told Reuters, adding he would not be surprised to see a jump in complaints about employees being misclassified as contractors. 
Peter Sung Ohr, the acting general counsel at the labor board, is pushing to increase the agency's annual budget for fiscal year 2022 by 10% and to add over 150 more employees to its offices, to prosecute U.S. labor law violations. 
In a rare interview, Ohr told Reuters he would not be surprised to see a jump in complaints about employees being misclassified as contractors. Misclassification of employees is an issue that ""comes up on a regular basis"" Ohr said, and as the economy evolves he expects to see the issue becoming ""more common."" 
""It will not be a surprise if we continue to see more of these issues come in front of the National Labor Relations Board,"" said Ohr.
The issue of employee misclassification looms large for rideshare and other ""gig economy"" companies, including Uber (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), that rely on contract labor instead of paying overtime and benefits. The industry is under pressure from Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, which has increasingly pushed for more rights for workers and to ease their ability to join unions.
Ohr, a career employee with the NLRB and former regional director for the agency in Chicago, noted that when such cases come up around the country, they can be ""consolidated and looked at in a national scope."" 
""That certainly happened in the last administration with Uber,"" he said, referring to misclassification complaints that came up in Chicago and San Francisco when Republican President Donald Trump was in office. 
Biden named Ohr, who may be best known for ruling in 2014 that Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University football players were employees with the legal right to unionize, immediately after taking office in January as he fired his predecessor, Peter Robb, Trump's appointee to the post. Jennifer Abruzzo, Biden's nominee for general counsel, awaits confirmation from the U.S. Senate.
Ohr's comments on employee misclassification came after the U.S. Labor Department blocked a rule in May which would have made it easier to classify gig workers as independent contractors. The NLRB and the Labor Department are separate agencies.
In April, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters he supports classifying gig workers as employees who deserve work benefits, pushing down shares of companies like Uber and Lyft.
The Biden administration also recently pushed to boost the budget of a Labor Department unit that investigates whether gig workers are misclassified. Biden's nominee to run that division has supported government crackdowns on the workforce models of gig-economy companies like Uber. 
Biden's American Jobs Plan legislation also helps to ""fund the NLRB's participation in a multi-year, multi-agency effort to combat misclassification of employees as independent contractors,"" according to a budget document filed by the NLRB to Congress. Ohr did not offer more details on what that effort would entail.
Ohr did not comment on a high-profile case involving Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is before the NLRB. The Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union is trying to persuade the labor board to throw out the results of a union election it lost in Alabama in early April by proving Amazon violated U.S. labor law.
There are ongoing legal challenges to Biden firing Robb and picking Ohr to lead the agency. The Department of Justice has recently filed a motion to intervene and argue on the legitimacy of Ohr's appointment.
MORE RESOURCES
Ohr, whose appointment was seen as a step toward establishing a more union-friendly NLRB, said in some agency offices around the country the number of cases being filed with it have gone up, after a drop during the Trump years. 
""In the last four or five months of this year ... the drop in case intake has stopped,"" Ohr said. 
Ohr hopes to raise the budget from $274 million in fiscal year 2021 to over $310 million to boost staffing, raise outreach and awareness for the work the agency does and make improvements in technology. According to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office in March, the agency's budget has declined 26% over the past decade. 
There has been a ""significant drop"" in staffing at the agency over the past three years, Ohr said. The latest budget requests 1,387 full-time employees, up from 1,223. 
In fiscal year 2020, the agency conducted 1,165 elections to certify or decertify a union and investigated 16,519 charges, recovering over $40 million for workers.
Biden on Tuesday said he intends to nominate a senior union lawyer, David Prouty, to the NLRB and fill the seat currently held by Republican William Emanuel, an attorney who has represented employers in labor law cases. 
The move follows his decision to nominate veteran union lawyer Gwynne Wilcox for a vacant seat on the NLRB. If both are confirmed, Democrats would take control of the five-member labor board.

Ohr said Democratic control would help get approvals for the budget and spending plans, adding that his goal is to support the mission of the National Labor Relations Act. 
""It is a law written to support collective bargaining, to support employees,"" Ohr said. ""I want to make sure that we continue to do that ... and that employers know that when there is a charge filed, the investigation is going to be neutral, unbiased,"" he said.

So, we think it is better to bet on quality tech stocks, such as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and SAP (SAP), that are trading at reasonable valuations and have plenty of upside remaining. Let’s discuss these names.Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market dominance in the tech space is unparalleled. Continued innovations and improving business fundamentals helped the stock advance by 45.9% over the past year to close yesterday’s trading session at $133.70. However, lately the company has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who is leading a push to pass new regulations for U.S. technology companies, said this month that AAPL would be prohibited under antitrust reform legislation from giving its own apps an advantage by preventing users from removing them on AAPL devices.
While the company has yet to resolve its case with ‘Fortnite’ creator Epic Games, its market dominance is being scrutinized by the Bundeskartellamt, Germany’s antitrust regulator, and a French court has set September 17 as the date for hearing a case against AAPL brought by the France’s finance ministry for allegedly abusive contractual terms imposed by the tech giant for selling software on its App Store. Given these developments, AAPL’s shares look overvalued at their current price. Their forward EV/S and P/S of 6.12x and 6.30x, respectively, are higher than the 4.26x and 4.03x industry averages. So, we think it’s better to wait for a better entry point in the stock.
However, we think investors seeking to capitalize on the renewed investors’ interest in the tech space could bet on quality tech stocks SAP SE (DE:SAPG) (SAP) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO). They are trading at reasonable valuations and these stocks are expected to continue gaining in the coming months on their solid financials and impressive growth prospects.

White said in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that, if confirmed, he would also make clear that the United States would not hesitate to take countervailing measures against the EU if it did not comply.
""I think this is clear, the United States is not a shrinking violet in terms of taking countervailing measures against the EU if they're not complying with the deal,"" White said.

The cruise operator recorded little to no revenue over the last few quarter after a coronavirus outbreak in one of its ships prompted U.S. health regulators to introduce a no-sail order, forcing it to tap billions of dollars in debt and even sell a few ships to stay afloat.
Carnival (NYSE:CUK) ended the second quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, down from $11.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, as it spent heavily to prepare its ships for voyages as curbs on sailing ease. 
The sector is, however, starting to see a revival in business in recent weeks as ships start to sail again from the Caribbean and the United States. 
Analysts are also expecting revenue growth to steady in the forthcoming quarters based on pent-up demand for leisure travel and the rapid rollout of vaccines in the United States.
Carnival has said that 42 ships in its 91-strong global fleet will be sailing by November, representing 52% of its total capacity. The cruise operator's European brands, Aida and Costa Cruises, have already resumed operations.
Net loss was $2.07 billion for the second quarter ended May 31, compared with $4.37 billion a year earlier. 

The operator of Princess Cruises also backed its expectations for a third-quarter loss.
Shares of the company were down about 1% in early trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. securities rules should be changed to allow stock exchanges to quote bids and offers in price increments of less than a penny so they can better compete with wholesale brokerages for retail orders, Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said on Thursday.
Retail trading volumes have soared over the past year-and-a-half, fueled by the move to commission-free trading by most large online brokerages in November 2019 - a model Robinhood helped pioneer - and by the work-from-home environment during the coronavirus pandemic.
But the vast majority of retail orders are sent to wholesale market makers, instead of exchanges, because the wholesalers can offer prices that are fractions of a cent better than the best prices available on exchanges, which are limited to penny increments.
""In a nutshell, exchanges cannot fairly compete with off-exchange market makers in executing our customers' orders,"" Tenev, who also called for lower exchange fees, said in a blog post https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/6/24/the-sub-penny-opportunity.
To better enable exchanges to compete, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should amend the so-called ""sub-penny"" rule that limits on-exchange quotes to one-cent increments, and allow them to quote prices up to four decimal places for all stocks, Tenev said. 
""If the sub-penny limitation is removed, and exchanges reduce fees for retail orders, we could see ... more transparency and perhaps more retail order flow executed on lit markets,"" he said, referring to exchanges which are considered ""lit"" because participants can see prices. 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently said he had asked his staff to recommend changes to minimum pricing increments on exchanges as part of a broader review of securities rules, because ""wholesalers may operate on an unequal playing field when competing for order flow.""

In 2005, when the sub-penny rule was enacted, there were concerns sophisticated electronic traders might jump ahead of retail orders using the smaller pricing increments. 
Spokespeople for Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's New York Stock Exchange declined comment.

Eric Dezeuze, a lawyer for the bank, said Natixis was lodging an appeal against the ruling as the bank denied any wrongdoing.
""Natixis still considers that it communicated to the public, with all due sincerity, the information available to the company regarding its exposures,"" the lender said in a statement after the ruling.
Natixis was among the French banks hit the hardest by the financial crisis in 2007, when bonds backed by low quality mortgages - dubbed sub-prime loans - collapsed, causing losses for many lenders as the fallout spread through financial markets.
It was eventually rescued by its parent bank BPCE and was later restructured.
""Natixis did not simply make a mistake in evaluating its exposure, it intentionally misled the market,"" the court ruled, saying that the bank's communication was ""unintelligible"".
Judges also ordered compensation for damages to retail investors. Natixis said that the total compensation for plaintiffs amounted to around 2 million euros.
""Natixis is appealing because this ruling did not take into account any of the arguments raised by Natixis, which considers that it did not commit any offence,"" Dezeuze said.
The case centred on a statement published in November 2007 by the bank regarding its subprime exposure. Natixis said it was not misleading as it could not have anticipated how the crisis would later escalate. 
French shareholders association Adam filed a complaint in 2009 on behalf of hundreds of retail investors, demanding investigations into Natixis' financial communications from 2006, when the bank was listed, until 2009.

The French financial watchdog AMF also looked into whether Natixis misled investors during the 2007 sub-prime crisis, but decided not to bring any charges against the bank.

Conversely, as the global economy continues to recover at an impressive pace, we think growth stocks McDonald’s (MCD) and Linde (NYSE:LIN) are well-positioned to perform much better than bitcoin in the near term. Read on for some details.Bitcoin has taken a hit since China increased its crackdown on domestic cryptocurrency mining owing to environmental concerns. Approximately 65% - 75% of global bitcoin mining is concentrated in China. However, the government crackdown has halted roughly 90% of China’s bitcoin mining capacity. Bitcoin has nearly halved in value since hitting its all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14 and has declined 11.8% over the past five days. While bitcoin has gained slightly over the past two days, the cryptocurrency markets are expected to remain subdued in the near future.
While the cryptocurrency market remains under pressure, equity markets have been showing strength due to favorable macroeconomic trends. The Nasdaq Composite hit its 14,317.66 all-time high yesterday, while the S&P 500 is currently hovering marginally below its all-time high. Declining unemployment claims and rising industrial and manufacturing activities have driven renewed interest in growth stocks, as evidenced by Vanguard Growth ETF’s (VUG) 6.6% gains over the past month versus the broader S&P 500 index’s 2.2% returns.

With the global economy regaining traction quickly, we think stocks such as Baidu (BIDU), Yum China (YUMC), and Finvolution (FINV) are well positioned to generate substantial returns in the near term. So, let’s take a closer look.
Despite the fact that several Chinese stocks are falling prey to an increasing regulatory clampdown, there is little doubt that they hold an immense potential for big growth in the near term. That’s in-part because the world’s second-largest economy generated record annual growth in the first quarter of 2021. In fact, China’s output jumped 18.3% year-over-year in the first three months of the year, its fastest rate since records began in the early 1990s.
While several economies, including Europe's, are still hamstrung by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, China and the United States are returning to the pre-pandemic growth levels. Although China’s regulatory crackdown and weak international relations remain a concern regarding many Chinese companies, the solid growth prospects of some of these companies should help their stocks rally in the near term.
Given the speedy recovery of the Chinese economy, Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Yum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC), and FinVolution Group (NYSE:FINV) should witness solid earnings and revenue growth in the coming months. So, we think these stocks could be good additions to one’s watchlist.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 12:22PM ET</span>","Ferrari unveils $320,000 hybrid sports car in its race to electric","By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) -Ferrari unveiled a new first plug-in hybrid car on Thursday as the luxury sports car maker famed for its roaring combustion engines retools its range for an electric era. 
The 296 GTB is Ferrari (NYSE:RACE)'s third hybrid to go into series production, which excludes limited-edition vehicles. It follows the SF 90 Stradale in 2019 and a convertible version, the SF90 Spider, last year. 
Ferrari Chief Marketing and Commercial officer Enrico Galliera said the 296 GTB created a new segment.
""If the SF 90 was designed to reach the peak of performance, this has been designed for the peak of pleasure of driving,"" he said in a web presentation. ""We expect this will also help us attract clients who are not driving a Ferrari now.""
The two-seater will cost 269,000 euros ($321,000), reaching 302,000 euros for it ""Assetto Fiorano"" high-performance version. It will have a top speed over 330 km per hour (205 mph).
The Italian company known worldwide for its prancing horse logo and red racing cars has promised its first full electric model in 2025.
""It's a process which has started a couple of years ago,"" Galliera said. ""We're working to cope with regulation and the task of reducing emissions."" 
Ferrari and its rivals are wrestling with how to shift their line-ups to battery power without losing the high performance that supports their premium pricing.
Porsche, part of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group, already offers a full-electric vehicle with its Taycan model, but Ferrari is ahead of its arch-rival Lamborghini, also part of Volkswagen, whose first full-electric car will not appear until the second half of this decade.
To drive into the new era of electrification, Ferrari has picked technology industry veteran Benedetto Vigna as its new chief executive.
The 296 GTB will be fitted with a 6-cylinder (V6) mid-rear turbo engine, the first on a road car with a Ferrari badge, although such engines have roots dating back to the 1950s in Ferrari racing cars.
Ferrari road cars are normally powered by V8 or more powerful - but also more polluting - V12 engines. 
Still, the V6 engine, coupled with a 122 KW electric motor, can produce a massive 830 horse power.
Like the SF90 Stradale, it can deliver 25 km of silent electric-only power. First deliveries are expected in the first quarter of 2022, starting from Europe.

The 296 GTB is the third of three cars Ferrari has promised for this year. Its first ever SUV, called Purosangue (Thoroughbred), is expected next year.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Column: China's sale of state zinc reserves is a well-timed trade,"By Andy Home
LONDON (Reuters) - The inclusion of zinc in China's sales of state metal reserves is testament to the market's continued surprising strength. 
London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month zinc hit a near three-year high of $3,108.50 per tonne last month and is currently trading around $2,900. 
The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) zinc contract has out-performed London, last month hitting its highest level since 2007. 
There is no evidence of the speculative excess the Chinese authorities have targeted in other over-heating commodities such as iron ore. 
ShFE zinc volumes shrank in both 2019 and 2020 and have risen only marginally this year. Market open interest hit a six-year low at the end of February. It has partially recovered but was still 24% down on last year at the end of May.
The lack of investor interest derives from a less-than-exciting narrative of a market inexorably moving into over-supply after the price spike of 2018. 
Yet zinc has stubbornly declined to perform to script, particularly in China. 
The largely unexpected price resilience is proving a boon for Western producers. It may prove to be highly propitious for China's state stockpile managers. 
ACCIDENTAL RESERVES
Zinc isn't classified as a strategic metal in China and the state's reserves have to some extent been accidental. 
Low prices in 2009 and again in 2012 saw what was then the State Reserves Bureau (SRB) coming to the rescue of local producers by buying up surplus metal. 
Tonnage and pricing were fully disclosed because the government wanted to send a price signal. As was also the case when the SRB sold 50,000 tonnes back to a resurgent market in 2010. 
Net purchases over the 2008-2013 period amounted to 354,000 tonnes, which is what the market assumes is the volume of zinc held by what is now The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration (NFSRA).
The NFSRA is tendering for the sale of 30,000 tonnes of zinc in July with the potential for more monthly sales if required. The auction is only open to industrial users. 
It's a neat way of combining limited firepower with maximum price signalling power as the government tries to dampen the inflationary heat. 
ALLEVIATING TIGHTNESS
It is also intended to alleviate short-term tightness in the Chinese supply chain caused by power rationing in Yunnan province. 
The hydro-rich province, which accounts for around 12.5% of the country's refined zinc production, is currently suffering from drought. All large power users, including zinc and aluminium producers, have been forced to reduce operating rates. 
This supply constraint has coincided with a period of super-strong demand growth as Chinese manufacturing rebounds from the pandemic, led by the steel sector, a big zinc user for galvanised sheet. 
The resulting tensions in the Chinese market-place have been the primary driver of higher zinc prices, both in Shanghai and in London. 
China is the world's largest processor of mined concentrates into zinc metal and its supply woes - a lack of raw material due to COVID-19 lockdowns last year and the current operating cap in Yunnan - have coloured the global picture. 
World mine supply surged by 11.3% in the first four months of this year as the disruption caused by lockdowns in key producer countries such as Peru fades. 
Yet global refined metal production grew by only 4.5%, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.
It estimates the zinc market recorded a supply-demand surplus of just 31,000 tonnes in January-April, compared with a surplus of 256,000 tonnes in the same period last year and an April forecast for a 353,000-tonne surplus this year.
The tighter-than-expected market is all down to the bottle-neck in China's processing sector. The country's refined metal production slid by 8.2% in May relative to April due to the power curtailments in Yunnan.
TURNING THE TIDE
Yunnan's rainy season normally starts around now, which should feed through to normalised operations at zinc smelters over the next couple of months. 
At which point analysts at Macquarie Bank expect zinc to ""drift back towards balance"" amid both concentrates and refined metal surpluses. The bank forecasts the zinc price to fall from an average $2,720 per tonne this year to $2,300 next year. (""Commodities Compendium,"" June 17, 2021)
Fitch Solution analysts are still gloomier, expecting ""a steady downtrend in prices out to 2030"", largely driven by slowing steel production in China. (""Zinc: Price Downtrend To Be Less Steep Than Previously Anticipated,"" June 18, 2021)
The country's steel production growth is expected to brake sharply from 7.8% in 2018-2022 to 1.3% over the subsequent five years. The flow-through drop in zinc demand for galvanising will transform China into a consistent net exporter, adding to global oversupply, Fitch warns.
The country hasn't been a net exporter since 2007 and imports have been running just north of 500,000 tonnes in each of the last two years. 
That's because the domestic market was in persistent supply deficit to the tune of 292,000 tonnes annually in 2016-2020, according to Fitch. That deficit market is expected to flip to an annual average surplus of 196,000 tonnes over 2026-2030.
SELLING THE HIGHS
Given such gloomy forecasts, it's no surprise that some are striking while the market is still hot. 
Australia's New Century Resources has just announced it has hedged forwards around 25% of its planned mine production - equivalent to around 90,000 tonnes payable zinc - out to June 2024.
The transaction with Macquarie Bank locks in a weighted average price of A$3,717 per tonne (or US$2,900 per tonne). ""The zinc price has never averaged above the company's achieved hedge price for a three-year duration,"" New Century noted. 
China's stockpile managers find themselves in the same fortuitous position, releasing metal into what just about every analyst thinks will be zinc's last bull hurrah. 
The SRB bought its zinc in 2008-2009 at prices under 12,000 yuan per tonne. The Shanghai price has slipped from its May highs but remains at a lofty 21,105 yuan.
Selling state reserves right now looks a very good zinc trade, whatever the broader political motivation to tame commodity price inflation. 

Particularly if the metal will plug the last remaining hole in a refilling supply chain.

EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ), and Generac (GNRC) have maintained decent momentum of late and their fundamentals should help them continue to do so over the near term. So, we think it could be smart to bet on these stocks now.While several major economies are now reopening, the stock market is far stable. Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled that it would hold benchmark interest rates near zero for now, but the central bank forecasts two rate hikes by the end of 2023. This indicates the Fed’s concerns over inflation. Indeed, the central bank has raised its inflation projections for 2021 to 3.4% from its 2.4% prior estimate.
Consequently, the stock market is expected to remain volatile. Against this backdrop, stocks that have gained momentum lately could be appropriate bets because their momentum is expected to continue irrespective of market volatility. Investors’ interest in the momentum stocks is evident in the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) and the Invesco DWA Momentum ETF’s (PDP) 3% and 4.6% gains, respectively, over the past month. This compares to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.9% returns.
EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ), and  Generac Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) have generated solid momentum and we think that their fundamental strength should help them to continue rallying, dodging the market’s volatility. So, it would be wise to bet on them now.

Investing.com – Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) jumped by almost 9% during Thursday’s session as its candidate to treat Alzheimer’s secured breakthrough designation from the Food and Drug Administration.  
The breakthrough tag allows the company to expedite the development of the monoclonal antibody.
Such a designation comes when a company is able to demonstrate that its proposed treatment will bring substantial improvement over already available therapies.
Lilly intends to submit a biologics license application for donanemab under the accelerated approval pathway later this year based on data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study.
The safety, tolerability and efficacy of donanemab are also being evaluated in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 3 study, Eli Lilly said in a note.
Experts and various other stakeholders were waiting for the outcome of Eli Lilly’s study, particularly after Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)’s ADUHELM™ (aducanumab-avwa) became the first Alzheimer’s treatment in 18 years to secure fDA’s accelerated approval.
Alzheimer’s is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks.
There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 2050. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide.

There is a nearly $500 million market to insure satellites, rockets and unmanned space flight, but no legal requirement for an operator such as Blue Origin, which Bezos founded, to insure passengers for injury or death or for space tourists to have life cover, brokers and insurers said.
""We're not aware of a case where anybody is insured against passenger liability,"" Neil Stevens, senior vice president, aviation and space at Marsh, the world's biggest insurance broker, told Reuters.
Assuming they lift-off as planned next month, Bezos and the other wannabe astronauts on Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft will not only spend several minutes 62 miles (100 km) above the earth in a truck-sized capsule, they also have to get back.
The only group that has regularly flown humans sub-orbitally since the 1960s is Branson's Virgin Galactic. All have been tests, with one failure in 2014 resulting in a death. Blue Origin has flown 15 unmanned sub-orbital flights with no failures, Seradata SpaceTrak data showed on June 10.
Bezos, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on their insurance plans and flight records.
'DIFFERENT RISK PROFILES'
Being uninsured in space is nothing new.
NASA and the U.S., in general, do not buy liability cover, with government launches basically insured by taxpayers, Richard Parker of Assure Space, a unit of insurer AmTrust Financial that provides space insurance, said.
NASA astronauts are eligible for government life insurance programs, a NASA spokesperson said in an emailed response.
Charles Wetton, underwriting manager for space policies at insurer Global Aerospace, said astronauts on government-funded missions are carefully selected for their knowledge, skills and fitness and train for several years before blast off.
""They and their families understand the risks of the work they do, Wetton said.
But commercial space cadets may only get a few days of training for a sub-orbital flight or a few months for a ride to the International Space Station (ISS), Wetton said, adding: ""These represent two very different risk profiles that insurers will take into account"".
Blue Origin on its website says the spaceflight passenger will receive training the day before the launch, including mission and vehicle overviews, safety briefings, mission simulation and instruction on in-flight activities. 
Virgin Galactic said participants will get three days of training and preparation before the launch.
Insurers expect iron clad waivers and contracts from commercial space travel firms, stating they will bear no burden if a passenger dies during a flight.
NASA has called for responses from the industry for its plans for a liability framework for privately-funded astronaut missions to the ISS. NASA's plans include requiring private astronauts to buy life insurance.
It is still early days, but cover for space tourists may be the next step, said Tim Rush, senior vice president, U.S. space, at insurance broker Gallagher, adding that the life insurance market currently provides individual cover of $2-5 million for private astronauts.
The only mandatory insurance in place for commercial space operators is third-party liability, mainly to cover property damage on earth or to a flying aircraft, said Akiko Hama, client executive, space and aerospace underwriting at Global Aerospace.
Blue Origin plans for its six-seater spacecraft to take off on July 20 and fly for four minutes beyond the boundary between the earth's atmosphere and outer space, where passengers will experience total weightlessness.

MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION
A key question for how the sector develops is whether risks related to tourism fall under space or aviation insurance lines, insurers and brokers told Reuters.
The U.N. Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention of 1972 governs all activities in space and very few countries have a legal framework for commercial human spaceflight, they said.
The first-ever aviation insurance policy was written by Lloyd's of London in 1911. A few years later the market insured Charles Lindbergh and his single-engine plane for $18,000 on its non-stop flight from the United States to Europe.
Space trips are different, said Marsh's Stevens, because the passengers are returning to the same place as they left, making it technically a domestic trip to which international aviation insurance cannot be applied, meaning there will also be no limitation to liability. 
""The aviation, aircraft insurance market, and the like, are less keen to take on risks that involve spacecraft,"" he said, adding that whether space tourism trips fall under aviation or space insurance is a ""million dollar question"".
While air travel is governed by rules that establish airline liability in the case of death of passengers, Stevens said he was unaware of plans for similar rules for space tourism.
However, Wetton said Global Aerospace had started to receive enquiries from companies for sub-orbital missions.

""In 10 years' time, maybe the two lines, aviation and spaceflight will look very similar,"" said Assure Space's Parker.
""Some legislative somewhere will say, look, we're now having average Joes flying on these launch vehicles and need to protect them,"" Parker added.

Deliveroo said it was the fourth court judgment in Britain which had determined its riders were self-employed, after one by the Central Arbitration Committee and two at the High Court.
The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) was refused permission in 2017 for collective bargaining rights for a group of Deliveroo riders on the basis that they were not workers under the terms of legislation on labour relations.
Employment models across the ""gig economy"" have been challenged in courts around the world by unions and workers.
In February, Britain's Supreme Curt ruled that a group of Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers were entitled to worker rights such as the minimum wage.
In Thursday's unanimous 3-0 verdict, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's dismissal of a judicial review of that judgement.
It said the fact that Deliveroo's riders did not have an obligation to provide services personally was a material factor.
A Deliveroo spokesperson said the verdict was an important milestone.
""UK courts have now tested and upheld the self-employed status of Deliveroo riders four times,"" the spokesperson said.
""Deliveroo's model offers the genuine flexibility that is only compatible with self-employment, providing riders with the work they tell us they value.""
The risk of legal challenges to its employment model was one reason that some major investors shunned Deliveroo's London listing in March.

The shares, which were sold for 390 pence in the IPO, rose as much as 9% on Thursday to a high of 274 pence, the highest level since April. 
Britain's opposition Labour Party said the decision was devastating for Deliveroo drivers, and the government should outlaw the company's ""exploitative employment practices"".

PARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is set to scrap a role overseeing ties with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) in favour of individual relations with the German group, three sources told Reuters, as they try to better manage a partnership that has not met initial hopes.
The shift comes as alliance-level executive Jacques Verdonck, who was in charge of the cooperation with Daimler, retires at the end of the month, the sources familiar with the matter said. 
France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) will instead rely on its head of partnerships, Sandra Gomez, while Nissan (OTC:NSANY) will do the same with Catherine Perez. 
Mitsubishi will also have a person in charge of partnerships, the sources said, adding the bilateral approach was in line with the new ""leader-follower"" strategy of the alliance. That involves leaning on the strengths of each carmaker in certain areas. 
Renault and Daimler declined to comment, while Nissan could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The plan marks another shift following the end of the Carlos Ghosn era at the alliance. The architect of the Franco-Japanese partnership, who also extended the collaboration to Daimler, was arrested on financial misconduct charges in Japan in late 2018, before fleeing to Lebanon in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. 
His exit strained already difficult relations between Nissan and Renault, which are now working to get back on track with cost-saving joint production projects among other steps. 
The partnership with Daimler - which owns high-end brand Mercedes-Benz, contrasting with the more accessible models produced by the others - has also looked in danger of losing steam. Nissan and Renault, both hit by losses, recently sold down their stakes in the German group. 
Collaborations on Renault's compact Twingo car and Daimler's Smart model are set to end, and some targets for industrial cooperation have been downgraded over the years. 
But Daimler still has a factory in Mexico with Nissan, and has been exploring the possibility of jointly developing at least one large van model with Renault.

An industry shift towards electric vehicles could yet yield other opportunities, one of the sources said. 
""The collaboration with Daimler is at present made up of Renault-Daimler projects, Nissan-Daimler ones and some between the three,"" another of the sources said, with yet another saying that the changes reflected a more pragmatic approach.

Meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) said on Thursday it will give away beef, pork and chicken for the next year to 50 U.S. families that participate in company-sponsored vaccination clinics over the coming weeks.
The Brazilian company's arm in the United States and Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), a U.S. chicken company mostly owned by JBS, came under fire last year as thousands of meatpacking workers fell sick with COVID-19. U.S. processing plants temporarily shut to contain outbreaks, tightening meat supplies and raising prices.
The companies said nearly 70% of their 66,000 U.S. employees are now fully vaccinated and that they hope the meat giveaways encourage residents in rural areas, not just employees, around their facilities to get shots.
""We've made great progress, and our vaccination rates are much higher than the rates in the communities that we call home,"" said Andre Nogueira, JBS USA chief executive.
The contest is the latest incentive being offered by companies and government officials to win over the vaccine hesitant. Around the world, perks from live chickens to marijuana are available to those who take the shot.
In the United States, President Joe Biden will likely miss a goal for 70% of adults to receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine by July 4, officials said.

The first round of JBS's clinics starts on Saturday in Greeley, Colorado, where the company operates a massive beef plant. Last year, six of the facility's workers died of COVID-19 and nearly 300 were infected, according to state data.
There was a ""failure of many meat processors to adequately protect their workers from COVID-19, resulting in tens of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths,"" U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow said at a hearing on Wednesday about the beef market.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 09:48AM ET</span>",U.S. bans imports of solar panel material from Chinese company,"By Karen Freifeld, Michael Martina and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Wednesday ordered a ban on U.S. imports of a key solar panel material from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co over forced labor allegations, two sources briefed on the matter said. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies and the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
Reacting on Thursday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China will take ""all necessary measures"" to protect its companies' rights and interests. Beijing has dismissed accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang as lies.
The three other companies added to the U.S. economic blacklist include Xinjiang Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ) Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based manufacturing giant East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co, part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd.
The Commerce Department said the companies and a paramilitary force, XPCC, ""have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in"" Xinjiang.
At least some of the companies listed by the Commerce Department are major manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon that are used in solar panel production.
Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an interactive investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry's reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and the impact on its business would be limited.
Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co responded Reuters' request for comment with an email saying the company has ""zero tolerance"" towards forced labour, and that it does not sell directly to U.S. companies, or purchase from the United States and there would not be ""a significant impact on the company’s business.""
The other companies or their parent firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment, or could not immediately be reached. XPCC could not immediately be reached for comment.
The ""Withhold Release Order"" by U.S. Customs and Border Protection only blocks imports of the material from Hoshine. A source familiar with the order said it does not impact the majority of U.S. imports of polysilicon and other silica-based products.
Dennis Ip, Regional Head of Power, Utilities, Renewables & Environment (PURE) Research at Daiwa said in a note to clients the immediate effect of the restrictions would be limited as the companies named do not have ""vast contracts"" with U.S. based wafer companies, but foresaw more action to come.
""However, we see possibility for the ban to gradually extend to include restrictions on all solar modules which contain Xinjiang-produced polysilicon,"" he said.
Chinese module producers could still use polysilicon from Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for their U.S.-bound module shipments, he added.
About 45% of all polysilicon used in solar module production is produced in Xinjiang, with 35% produced in other parts of China. The remainder comes from outside China.
The global solar energy supply chain has been squeezed by record high costs for polysilicon, labour and freight.
A second source said the move does not conflict with President Joe Biden's climate goals and support for the domestic solar industry.
The sources said the United States is continuing to investigate allegations of forced labor by Chinese companies who supply polysilicon.
The two sources familiar with the policy said the White House sees the actions as a ""natural continuation"" of the G7 agreement earlier this month to eliminate forced labor from supply chains.
The U.S. Treasury Department last year sanctioned XPCC for ""serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities.""

The paramilitary organization remains powerful in Xinjiang's energy and agriculture sectors, operating almost like a parallel state, having been sent to the region in the 1950s to build farms and settlements.
Foreign governments and human rights activists say it has been a force in the crackdown and surveillance of Uyghurs in the region, running some detention camps.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Volvo Cars plans to make lidar sensors standard equipment in a new generation of its XC90 SUV next year as part of a strategy to deploy more advanced safety and automated driving technology that relies on precise images of the world around the vehicle.
The decision by Volvo Cars to fold lidar sensors into the base price of its vehicle is a bet that customers will pay for the additional capability. It has been called a ""watershed moment"" by some in the industry. 
The Swedish brand, owned by China's Geely group, is taking a sharply different road from rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has shunned lidar and radar and is focusing on just cameras and software for its automated driving systems. 
Self-driving car sensor startup Luminar Technologies Inc will supply Volvo Cars with its Iris lidar and Sentinel software in combination with software from Volvo in the electric XC90 SUV that will be built in South Carolina and go on sale in 2022, the companies said.
The new technologies are designed to address traffic situations that often result in severe injuries and fatalities. Over time, the technology will become more capable and will increasingly intervene to prevent collisions, the companies said.
""By having this hardware as standard, we can continuously improve safety features over the air and introduce advanced autonomous drive systems,"" Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. 
Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by many automakers to enable obstacle detection and avoidance in advanced driving assistance systems and eventually in fully automated vehicles.
Until now, lidar has been too costly for automakers to implement as anything other than an option that costs extra. Luminar CEO Austin Russell said the pricing for its lidar is on the order of $1,000 per unit.
Volvo Cars' chief technology officer, Henrik Green, said cost is not the focus for the Swedish auto brand. While the price of the technology will come down over time as volumes grow, the rollout will accelerate use of automated services that the company can charge for.
Green said subsequent vehicles will add the lidar package as standard, and that this continues Volvo Cars' history of being first to standardize many safety features, including three-point seat belts and side-impact airbags.
""This is kind of a watershed moment for the industry,"" Russell said in an interview. ""You don't have an option package for airbags. You don't have an option package for seatbelts. Why should you have an option package for life-saving technology?"" 
Russell declined to say what the deal will mean financially for Luminar or discuss potential volumes, but the XC90 is Volvo Cars' top-selling U.S. vehicle and third-most popular globally last year with almost 92,500 sales.
Luminar said in March it had struck a deal with a software unit of Volvo Cars, Zenseact, to offer a combination hardware-software system to power autonomous features for Volvo vehicles. Luminar said at the time the system also would be sold to other automakers.
The system will aim to provide automated driving, but only on highways, Luminar has said. It will use a computing chipset from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and also use cameras and radar sensors in addition to Luminar's lidar unit, but can be made to work with the cameras and radars that many automakers have already included in their vehicles.

SAIC Motor Corp, China's largest automaker, has said it will offer self-driving vehicles in that market next year in partnership with Palo Alto, California-based Luminar.
Luminar, founded in 2012, is one of several U.S. lidar manufacturers in the past year to go public via reverse mergers with blank-check companies.

The head of the Zurich-based group's reinsurance division Moses Ojeisekhoba told a media event that the trend appeared to be ""travelling along the same lines as April 1 and January 1"", when contracts were most recently renewed. 
""We do not see any market differences at this point in terms of trends,"" Ojeisekhoba said. 
He said it was too early to make a forecast for the next policy renewal round in early July.

Swiss Re, industry leader Munich Re and other reinsurers were able to push through price increases during contract renegotiations in January and April and are using this to expand their business. 
In contract renewals in April, Swiss Re increased premium volume in property and casualty insurance by a fifth and achieved a 4% price increase. Munich Re underwrote 17% more business, with prices rising by an average of 2.4%.

656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Billions Enter BlackRock ETFs in Likely Tax Dodge That’s Legal,"(Bloomberg) -- Five BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) funds just recorded massive inflows that carry all the hallmarks of tax-ducking ETF trades known as heartbeats.
The exchange-traded products collectively lured about $13.5 billion on Wednesday amid the rebalancing of the FTSE Russell indexes, compared with a $37 million inflow for all five funds last week.
Unexpected surges like this can occur for multiple reasons including a large investor shifting funds or adjustments by a major portfolio. But all these BlackRock ETFs have a track record that shows at least one sudden major inflow, followed almost immediately by a corresponding outflow -- the tell-tale signs of a heartbeat trade.
These are perfectly legal transactions designed to defer taxes faced by fund investors and are fairly common within the ETF industry, although the scale of the trades over this short timeframe is somewhat unusual.
A spokesperson for BlackRock didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Known as a heartbeat since the flows resemble the blip of a cardiac monitor, these trades occur when a fund is looking to get rid of stocks that have appreciated in value, without incurring taxes.
“It’s really one of the true beauties of the structure,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence “The ability to do these custom heartbeats ahead of a major index re-balance is a big advantage, whether it’s an annual reconstitution like the Russell 1000 or a higher turnover strategy.”
This naturally takes place in ETFs, because inflows and outflows are made via a market maker who by design swaps assets for shares rather than transacting in cash. With a heartbeat, a friendly bank is pumping extra assets into a given fund so that extra withdrawals can be made -- allowing more equity gains to be washed out.

The trigger for Wednesday’s activity is likely this week’s rebalancing of FTSE Russell indexes, which means funds are looking to get rid of shares that have appreciated significantly. It’s highly likely that other ETFs are affected and similar heartbeat trades are occurring with other issuers.
All five of the BlackRock funds involved follow FTSE Russell gauges. They are:
In order to complete the heartbeat, large outflows can be expected in the coming days.

Volkswagen said it was considering a potential transaction, together with investors Attestor and Pon Holdings, although considerations were at a very early stage and no decisions had been taken.
Company sources told Reuters a year ago that VW wanted to buy back Europcar, which it sold to French financial investor Eurazeo (PA:EURA) in 2006 for 3.3 billion euros ($3.94 billion), including debt.
Europcar said on Wednesday it had rejected a takeover bid, without specifying the bidder, saying the 0.44 euro per share price offered was too low.
The car rental business has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus pandemic given the collapse of the travel market.
Europcar's shares were up 5% on Thursday at 0.4550 euros.
Volkswagen said buying Europcar was one of several options it was considering to give the company access to a rental platform that would support its ""long-term mobility vision"" and strengthen its range of products and services.
Company sources have suggested that Volkswagen could use Europcar's network of rental stations to help it become a broader provider of different mobility options.

Bloomberg news agency had already reported that Europcar had rejected a $2.6 billion takeover bid from Volkswagen.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens unveiled targets on Thursday to outpace the market by combining its core engineering business with digital expertise in the first strategic blueprint under new Chief Executive Roland Busch.
Busch, who took over as CEO from Joe Kaeser in February, wants to win customers and deliver growth by using Siemens's software and hardware, the company said at its investor day.
The German engineering company aims to expand beyond its traditional industrial customers by boosting its digital offering used to improve the performance of their factories, trains and buildings.
""Digilitalisation, automation and sustainability are growth engines for our business. Here, our core business and our digital business reinforce each other in a virtuous circle,"" Busch said in a statement.
Under the plan, Siemens raised its target for increasing its comparable annual revenue at a rate of 5%-7%, above global market growth and Siemens's own previous target. Both ran at 4%-5%.
Digital technology is expected to lead, with a faster growth rate of 10% per year from the 5.3 billion euros ($6.33 billion) of revenues Siemens made in the area in 2020.
The company also hiked the profit margin targets for its mobility and smart infrastructure businesses, in the goals that will apply from October 2021, the start of Siemens's 2022 business year.
BUYING INTO NEW MARKETS
Under the strategy, Siemens said it will develop digital applications for specific industries and launch products more quickly in areas, including automation, artificial intelligence and cyber security.
The company, which competes with Switzerland's ABB, France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), also wants to enter additional markets with a value of 120 billion euros through organic growth and acquisitions. 
No details were given on how much Siemens would spend, but its $700 million acquisition announced in May of U.S. electronic components company Supplyframe and the last year's $16.4 billion purchase of  Varian Medical  Systems (NYSE:VAR) were examples of this approach.
Still, Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas said Siemens remained committed to keeping its investment grade rating.
Accompanying the targets will be a new 3 billion euro ($3.58 billion) share buyback, starting in October to run until 2026. The buyback is a slowdown from the company's two 3 billion euro repurchases over the last five years.
Siemens also committed to a progressive dividend policy, which means a rising or stable annual pay out to shareholders. 
Earnings per share, before the amortisation of goodwill for acquisitions would increase in the high single digit range, around 8% to 10%, the company added. 

In an update on trading, Siemens said the favourable business development had continued, and it expected full year net income in the range of 5.7 to 6.2 billion euros. 
The forecast included the impact of the 300 to 500 million euro integration costs associated with the Varian acquisition which had not been included in previous company outlook.

Biogen's (NASDAQ:BIIB) Aduhelm was approved for Alzheimer’s on June 7 after gaining breakthrough status in a controversial move by the Food and Drug Administration. Lecanemab, another drug being developed by Biogen and its partner Eisai (OTC:ESALY), received the same designation Wednesday. Lilly gained as much as 8.7% in trading before U.S. markets opened. Biogen fell 3.5%.
Like Aduhelm, Lilly’s donanemab attacks amyloid, an abnormal protein believed to be involved in the damage Alzheimer’s causes in the brain. Critics of the Biogen drug’s approval have said that human trials haven’t definitively shown its effectiveness, and that its $56,000 annual price tag is excessive.
Lilly intends to submit a biologics license application for donanemab under the accelerated approval pathway later this year, according to a company statement Thursday.
Breakthrough therapy status is designed to speed development and review of drugs for serious or life threatening ailments. It doesn’t mean the FDA will approve the drug in question, or that the agency has already determined that the experimental medicine is, in fact, a breakthrough.

Investing.com – Shares of Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) reversed initial losses in Thursday’s premarket trading after slightly better-than-expected guidance for the coming year offset disappointment over sluggish sales and rising costs.
For the ongoing fiscal 2022, the company sees total sales of approximately $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion. Diluted net EPS is seen between $7 and $7.50, the midpoint of which is fractionally above the consensus of $7.21.
Consolidated same-restaurant sales for the quarter ended May 30 were 0.5% below the 2019 level, despite rising 80% on a year-on-year basis.
Total sales of $2.28 billion were driven by a blended same-restaurant sales increase of 90% and the addition of 30 net new restaurants.
While earnings rose, costs accelerated too. Inflation in food and beverages was sharp as they rose to $663.1 million from $396.5 million in the same quarter last fiscal. Higher wage costs hurt too.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $2.03 compared to a net loss per share of $1.24 last year.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian car-sharing company Delimobil plans to expand into markets in developing countries and to sell local franchises, its founder and main shareholder Vincenzo Trani told Reuters.
Delimobil, one of Russia's biggest car-sharing providers along with  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX).Drive and others, has said it plans to list on the New York Stock early next year.
""Russia will definitely remain our main focus, but we will also expand our business abroad,"" Trani said in an interview. ""We will take a mixed approach. We plan to expand using both our own model and franchises.""     
He said Delimobil was in talks with Qatar to launch a franchise of Anytime Prime, its service offering long-term car rentals. 
Trani said there was interest from Uzbekistan in a classic car-sharing franchise. Countries from Asia and North Africa are interested in franchises or in Delimobil developing its own local business, he said.
Delimobil has more than 16,000 cars in Russia. It also operates in Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic under its Anytime brand.
    ""We are offering a car-sharing service to developing countries because it is a good tool for them to close the gap in mobility they have because people just can't afford to have as many cars as in developed countries,"" he said. 
Last year, Delimobil said it planned to sell a minority stake to investors in a pre-placement before floating a 40% stake on the New York Stock Exchange to raise around $300 million early next year. 
Russian bank VTB purchased up to 15% in Delimobil for $75 million this month.

""We will definitely continue our regional expansion (inside Russia),"" CEO Elena Bekhtina told Reuters. The company operates in 10 Russian regions after recently launching in Kazan, she said.

(Reuters) - British homebuilder Crest Nicholson raised its annual profit forecast and said its sales would grow even as the government gradually tapers stamp duty breaks aimed at propping up the housing market during the pandemic.
The company, which focuses on suburban areas outside London and in southern England, said the resilience would come from continued demand for higher-value homes that are not part of the support measures. 
In July 2020, the threshold at which homebuyers in much of Britain would pay stamp duty - or property purchase tax - was raised from 125,000 to 500,000 pounds ($175,000-$700,000). This will gradually be unwound between the end of this month and the beginning of October. 
""Based on demand for homes which will complete after the 30 September 2021 stamp duty deadline, we are confident that the housing market will remain robust,"" said Crest Nicholson, which specialises in chiefly detached and semi-detached houses. 
The midcap company raised its forecast for its 2021 adjusted profit before tax to at least 100 million pounds, from a previous forecast of 95 million pounds. That would represent a rise of about 118% versus last year, when it made 45.9 million pounds of profit. 
The stamp duty holiday and demand for bigger homes that are better for remote working helped the company swing to a 36.3 million pound profit for the six months ended April from a year-earlier loss of 51.2 million pounds, sending its shares up more than 5% in morning trade. 
Refinitiv Eikon data projects a 93% surge in Crest Nicholson's earnings in the current year, and a 28% growth in fiscal 2022.
Another British homebuilder, Vistry - which has a relatively higher exposure to lower-priced homes - will see earnings growth slow to 17% next year, according to the Refinitiv forecast data. It expects to more than double profits this year as people rush to take advantage of the schemes. 
""Crest's margins are beginning to yield the benefits of fewer legacy sites and the operational efficiency programme,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts in a note.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, rebounding from Wednesday’s dip as investors digest comments from Federal Reserve officials ahead of a number of economic data releases. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 175 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 80 points, or 0.6%.
The main equity indices closed largely lower Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.2%, the broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, climbing 0.1% to another record high.
Yet, despite these losses, the equity averages have pushed higher this week, with comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell earlier in the week downplaying concerns about rising consumer prices helping to soothe investors after last week’s hawkish central bank meeting.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts expect the global economy to grow by 5.9% this year, with the U.S. expanding by an even higher 6.9%, led by vaccine rollouts, fiscal stimulus and a broadening services recovery.
“We are looking for equities to be the asset class that is going to outperform over the next six months to a year,” said Credit Suisse analyst Ray Farris, on CNBC. “As long as earnings continue to trend higher, history suggests that equities will grind their way up.
There are more Fed speakers due to explain their thinking later Thursday, including John Williams, the president of the Federal Bank of New York, who stated Monday that it was too early for the central bank to begin reining in its asset purchases..
The earnings slate includes results from the likes of Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), while the banking sector will also be in the spotlight ahead of the release of the latest Fed stress tests.
The highlight of the economic data releases will be the weekly initial jobless claims release, seen falling to 380,000 for the week ending June 19, dropping again after the surprise rise to 412,000 for the week before. 
Additionally, the final release of the first quarter GDP is expected to confirm that the U.S. economy grew by 6.4% annualized in the first three months of the year, while durable goods orders should climb 2.8% in May, rebounding after a 1.3% fall the previous month.
Crude oil prices edged lower Thursday, handing back some of the recent strong gains after U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the fifth consecutive week, the longest run since January 2021.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.3% at $72.84 a barrel, after climbing late Wednesday as high as $74.25 per barrel, a peak not seen since Oct. 18, while Brent was down 0.3% at $74.94, just off Wednesday’s $76 high, also a 2018 peak.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A senior member of Japan's ruling party on Thursday accused activist investors in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp of focusing only on short-term profits and called for better monitoring of such investors to protect economic security.
Once a crown jewel of corporate Japan, Toshiba has been battered by accounting scandals stretching back to 2015 and massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business as well as the sale of its semiconductor unit, leaving it a shadow of its former self.
The comments from Akira Amari, a former economy minister and an influential lawmaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are some of the sharpest yet after an investigation commissioned by Toshiba shareholders revealed this month that Toshiba's management colluded with the government to put pressure on foreign activist investors to support the management.
""There should be strict monitoring. We need to watch carefully so that Japan's security is not threatened,"" Amari told Reuters in an interview.
He said it was ""not right"" that Toshiba was reliant on activist investors who were only interested in short-term profits and did not understand the importance of the conglomerate to Japan's ""economic intelligence"". 
""Activist investors only think about selling high,"" he said.
His comments are likely to deepen concern among foreign investors about Japan's openness to their investment.
Japan introduced new foreign ownership rules in 2020 aimed at protecting industries critical to national security but the investigation commissioned by shareholders found that the company and the government deviated from the purpose of the rules.
But Amari stressed there was no problem with the government's response to the company's troubles. 
After the investigation was published, Toshiba said it would change its board director nominees, with two audit committee members stepping down.
The committee has come under scrutiny as the investigation alleged it failed to take action even when it became aware of Toshiba's attempt to prevent shareholders from exercising their rights.
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5.4 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, 3D Investment Partners and U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management together own more than 20% of Toshiba.
Amari said Japanese investors, not foreign activists, should have invested in Toshiba to save the company.

Toshiba is due to hold a shareholder meeting on Friday when its board chairman, Osamu Nagayama, is expected to face a vote over his reappointment.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement that Deutsche Securities Asia Limited had issued the incorrect periodic statements between 2006 and October 2018, due to a design defect of its front office system. 
The unit discovered the problem with the system in August 2018, but did not report it to the regulator until February 2019 after it had completed an internal investigation, the statement said. 

""We are pleased to put this matter, which was remediated three years ago, fully behind us,"" said a Hong Kong based Deutsche Bank spokeswoman.

Investing.com – Shares in  Fannie Mae  (OTC:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) have struggled to show any sign of a bounce in premarket on Thursday, a day after having their value slashed by a Supreme Court ruling that effectively ruled out their privatization in the foreseeable future.
Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove was just one analyst to suspend his ratings on the two mortgage agencies after the Supreme Court Wednesday handed the U.S. President the authority to fire the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees them.
Bove said the suspension will be in place under he studies the order.
FHFA Director Mark Calabria quit in the wake of the Court order and the FHFA said the White House had named Sandra Thompson as its acting director. President Joe Biden has indicated that he intends to keep the agencies under federal control, in contrast to his predecessor.
Fannie and Freddie shares had both plunged more than 32%, the biggest one-day slide for the companies since February 2017. The bleeding was even worse for various share classes of preferred stock owned by major hedge funds, triggering losses that in some cases exceeded 60%, according to Bloomberg.
Fannie and Freddie shareholders Patrick Collins, Marcus Liotta and William Hitchcock had sued the FHFA and the Treasury Department in Texas in 2016 in an attempt to ensure that any profits made by the agencies went to shareholders, a move resisted by the FHFA. "
674,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Gas infrastructure across Europe leaking planet-warming methane - video footage,"By Kate Abnett and Shadia Nasralla
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The potent greenhouse gas methane is spewing out of natural gas infrastructure across the European Union because of leaks and venting, video footage made available to Reuters shows. 
Using a 100,000 euro ($119,000) infrared camera, non-profit Clean Air Task Force (CATF) found methane seeping into the atmosphere at 123 oil and gas sites in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Romania this year.
Methane, the biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide (CO2), is the main component of natural gas and over 80 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the air.
Currently, the EU does not regulate methane emissions in the energy sector, meaning companies running the sites surveyed by CATF are not breaking laws because of leaks or venting.
While some member states require firms to report some emissions there is no overarching framework forcing them to monitor smaller leaks, or fix them.
That's set to change.
The EU is proposing laws this year that will force oil and gas companies to monitor and report methane emissions, as well as improve the detection and repair of leaks.
In the energy sector, methane is emitted intentionally through venting and by accident from sites such as gas storage tanks, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, pipeline compressor stations and oil and gas processing sites.
CATF visited over 200 sites in seven EU countries and filmed emissions with the infrared camera in public vantage points to detect hydrocarbons invisible to the naked eye, such as methane.
""Once you see it, you can't unsee it,"" said CATF's James Turitto, who filmed the emissions. ""If we have any hope of achieving only a 1.5 Celsius rise in average global temperatures, we must stop these leaks.""
Altogether, CATF counted 271 incidents, with some sites leaching methane from several places.
Turitto said over 90% of the sites he visited in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Romania were emitting methane while his hit rate in Germany and Austria was lower. 
Global methane intensity on the rise https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/METHANE-GAS/nmopaedjzpa/chart.png 
LEAKS AND HOLES
A selection of the CATF thermography, which shows hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, was reviewed by five technical experts contacted by Reuters.
Given emissions were at installations handling natural gas - and methane is its main component - they concluded the emissions recorded by CATF were almost certainly methane.
At one gas plant owned by Italy's Eni near the town of Pineto on the country's Adriatic coast, methane appears to be leaking from a rusty hole in the side of a tank.
The footage captures a snapshot of each site's emissions on a given day so it cannot quantify the amount of methane being emitted over longer periods.
What it does reveal is emissions that could be avoided if infrastructure owners used commercially available measurement and abatement technology, emissions experts said.
""If there are cracks in the storage tanks, it is a relatively easy fix to patch the tanks,"" said Jonathan Dorn, an air quality expert at Abt Associates.
Turitto said he called an emergency number for reporting leaks at the Eni site but the line was dead.
Eni said the leak at Pineto was from a water tank which would have had negligible amounts of gas and that it had been detected and fixed during regular maintenance.
""We are strengthening our efforts in the implementation of periodic leak detection and repair monitoring campaigns,"" Eni said, adding that it was supportive of EU regulations to address methane emissions.
COMPANIES ON NOTICE
Brussels put energy companies on notice in October that it would target them with new rules on gas leaks and was also considering restrictions on venting or flaring of methane. 
""The Commission calls on companies in the oil, gas and coal sectors to set up more robust leak detection and repair programmes to prepare for upcoming proposals for legislation that would make such programmes mandatory,"" it said. 
An EU official told Reuters this month that because the EU has few methane ""super emitters"", the legislation would focus on tackling the smaller but far more frequent emissions that occur throughout energy sector infrastructure.
""The first thing is to really try to address these more diffused emissions of methane, covering the whole energy sector,"" the official, who declined to be named, said.
Experts say the new rules will shake things up for every oil and gas firm in Europe, not least because the EU is considering forcing companies to find and fix even the smallest leaks.
""Each company has a lot to do,"" said Andris Piebalgs, professor at the Florence School of Regulation and a former EU energy commissioner.
It is unlikely the new rules would take effect before 2023 but Brussels wants to get them in place early enough to contribute to its goal of cutting net emissions of all greenhouse gases by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels.
INTENTIONAL EMISSIONS
The EU is not alone. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration plans to propose new rules this year to reduce methane emissions. 
The New York Times used an infrared camera to identify large methane leaks at U.S. oil and gas sites in 2019 while satellite footage made available to Reuters revealed massive methane leaks from Russian gas pipelines. https://nyti.ms/3iCpJyn 
CATF's footage shows Italian energy company SNAM was venting hydrocarbons consistently over three dates during a two-week period from two stacks at its Panigaglia LNG terminal near La Spezia on the Mediterranean coast.
Tim Doty, a consultant in thermographic imaging in the energy sector and a former official at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said the footage showed the stacks were ""openly venting hydrocarbon emissions"".
At a SNAM underground storage facility at Minerbio near Bologna, the infrared footage showed a plume of methane flowing out of a vent stack.
SNAM said it was a member of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP), a voluntary group of energy companies that is committed to improving methane measurement and abatement. Eni is also a member.
""Emissions recorded by CATF at the Minerbio and Bordolano storage sites are fugitive emissions resulting from blowdown valves that are internally leaking ... the full replacement, starting in 2021, will be completed in 2024,"" SNAM said.
""The (Panigaglia) emission recorded by CATF at the vent stacks was due to the temporary mechanical failure of an air compressor,"" it said. ""We are confident to be able to fix the air compressor during the second half of 2021."" 
Methane emissions sources in the European Union https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/METHANE-GAS/xklvyajgxvg/chart.png 
HUNTING THE SOURCE 
An expert with nearly two decades of experience at major oil companies who advises U.S. firms and authorities on methane emissions said the CATF footage showed the EU had a problem.
""There is this urban legend that the U.S. natural gas system is disproportionately leaky compared to the rest of the world,"" said the expert, who declined to be named. ""When I look at these videos, they don't seem very different than the United States.""
Globally, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is rising. The U.N. said in April that without deep cuts in methane emissions this decade, the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to 1.5 Celsius would slip out of reach.
Once methane is in the atmosphere, it is all but impossible to trace it back to a specific source which means better monitoring at the point of emission is key.
A growing web of satellites searching for methane means major leaks of thousands of tonnes a year are easier to identify but many smaller leaks go unnoticed.
In Hungary, the footage showed a MOL site which separates gas from oil venting emissions.
The Hungarian energy company said it was aware of the emissions and they were an unavoidable part of normal and safe operations to avoid pressure building up in storage tanks.
MOL said there were no existing regulations requiring it to measure or report emissions but it aimed to end routine methane emissions from gas activities by 2030.
In Austria, at an OMV oil facility near onshore wells north of Vienna, the camera showed a number of smaller leaks.
OMV said it fully supported new EU methane rules. It said the minor leaks at the site had been fixed and it was planning to replace pressure regulation systems that release methane with equipment that stops such emissions.

""The presence of these emissions indicates that this site has ongoing maintenance issues,"" said Doty, pointing to four different sources. ""These emissions are very troubling.""

By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -Housebuilder and logistics firm St. Modwen Properties said on Thursday it has agreed to a sweetened 1.25 billion pounds ($1.75 billion) offer from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) to take it private. 
Demand for warehousing has soared as the pandemic accelerated a shift to online shopping and ordering, boosting UK-listed St. Modwen, which counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) UK, DHL and Ocado (LON:OCDO) as clients. 
The company has also benefited from a strong recovery in the housing market after an initial hit from the health crisis.
The recommended 560 pence per share cash offer for St. Modwen was final, Blackstone said, but it could make a new proposal if another suitor for the real estate developer emerged.
Shares of St. Modwen, which builds homes, owns and manages several industrial and logistics assets in Britain, were hardly changed at 553 pence in morning trading.
St. Modwen's top shareholder Aviva, which has a 7.27% stake, Refinitiv Eikon data shows, said it would back the offer at a shareholder meeting set for July 21, as did Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds roughly 2.2%. 
The latest offer is at a premium of about 25% to the stock's closing price the day before the first offer was made on May 7. Shares have climbed about 23% in the same period. 
St. Modwen's directors said the latest offer was in the ""best interests"" of shareholders.
Blackstone last month put forward a 542 pence per share offer for St. Modwen. The stock rose 20% but failed to rise to the offer price. 
Private equity interest in British companies has increased in recent months in an investment climate marked by soaring stock markets and very low interest rates. 

Blackstone itself was involved in a takeover battle for Australia's Crown Resorts Ltd, and bought out private jet services firm Signature Aviation as part of a consortium.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank has tapped software firm Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to simplify its information technology systems, enabling Germany's top lender to cut costs, a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) board member said on Thursday.
Deutsche Bank has spent years modernising its computer systems that have repeatedly caused headaches and which former Chief Executive John Cryan had publicly called ""lousy"".
The migration is expected to take three to five years and should help lower Deutsche Bank's total annual costs to 16.7 billion euros ($19.9 billion) by 2022 from the 19.5 billion it posted in 2020.
In 2021, the bank plans to add 2,000 to 3,000 jobs in technology, data and innovation, said Deutsche Bank Chief Technology Officer Bernd Leukert, who joined from SAP in 2019 and has since been reorganising the bank's IT systems. 
By the end of next year, half of the unit's staff would be software engineers, up from 30% at the end of 2020, he said at an event this week.
Oracle is planning to transfer platforms of some of Deutsche Bank's core functions such as payments, trading and risk management to one system, promising smooth operation and regular updates, the two groups said on Thursday. ""We want to reduce the complexity of our technology estate. The goal is to run the bank with around one third of the applications we have today,"" Leukert told Reuters. 
Deutsche declined to comment on how much it was investing in the IT upgrades.

For less critical applications, Deutsche already uses technology from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and will continue to work with SAP technology. Oracle is setting up a private cloud for Deutsche Bank, modernising the bank's technology that must stay on premises for regulatory reasons. Oracle has created clouds for others but Deutsche's would be its largest to date, Oracle manager Juan Loaiza said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Allstate Corp wants to buy more independent insurance agencies this year to build the business it acquired with its purchase of National General, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) Chief Executive Tom Wilson told Reuters on Wednesday.
But the agents will be there to talk to customers in depth, not punch data into a computer to get a quote, Wilson said at the Reuters Future of Insurance U.S.A. 2021 conference. 
""There's no future in that - no need for a human modem anymore,"" Wilson said. Allstate's strategy is to supply agents with customer data via computer to enable ""a real conversation,"" he said. ""'What about your 16-year-old? Is your son or daughter at college actually driving the car?' You can have a different kind of conversation. That's what we're trying to do.""
To see the video, click https://vimeo.com/566795077/c339f068f9 
Allstate's strategy stands out after a year in which many insurance companies sped up their ""digital transformation"" in response to the world working from home during the pandemic, and are relying more heavily on website and mobile apps to interact with customers.
Earlier this year, Allstate sold its life and annuity businesses and bought National General Holdings (NASDAQ:NGHC) Corp, greatly expanding its network of agents who sell products from a variety of companies, even as Allstate's Web and telephone sales are showing substantial growth.
On the issue of climate change, Wilson said the U.S. government should, over a period of years, get out of the money-losing flood insurance program and shift coverage to the private sector. This would help risk to be better-priced and avoid rate decisions being ""embedded in some political process where some local congressperson fights against getting their rates raised because they want another 150 votes,"" Wilson said.
The National Flood Insurance Program, which is $20.5 billion in debt, is being partly overhauled this year. 
However, Wilson said government can play a role in insuring big climate risks - those in which it is going to pay anyway. 
If a Force 5 hurricane hits Dade County, Florida, for example, the state and insurers will need help. ""The federal government is going to have to come and figure out how to build the infrastructure, help people rebuild their houses,"" Wilson said. 

""The federal government should think about that in advance, as opposed to waiting for it to happen.""

678,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>",Amazon sees Prime Day sales boost amid supply chain snags,"(This June 22 story corrects quote and attribution in paragraph 13)
By Siddharth Cavale, Victoria Waldersee and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Day saw strong online sales growth in the United States on Monday even as supply chain snafus and a robust spending appetite limited the level of discounts on popular products like electronics.
Total online sales across all U.S. retailers jumped 8.7% from last year's levels to $5.6 billion, data from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)'s Digital Economy Index released on Tuesday showed. Adobe did not provide a breakdown of the data.
Amazon uses deals to boost the number of subscribers to its loyalty club Prime. This year, the event coincided with the lifting of COVID restrictions in many countries as well as stiffer competition from retailers like  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) that are piggybacking on Amazon's past success. 
On Monday, larger retailers saw online sales rise 28% this year. In 2018, sales increased 54% and jumped 64% in 2019, according to Adobe’s figures. 
Analysts estimate this year’s total Prime Day sales will range from $9.5 billion to $12 billion, which would be a record for the event. 
Toys, home appliances and electronics saw the biggest discounts, by Amazon and brands, on the first day of this year’s Prime event - but even these were relatively low at 12%, 5.2% and 3% respectively, according to Adobe. Prime discounts will end just before midnight on Tuesday.
Indeed, a Reuters review of a basket of products sold on Amazon in different markets showed electronics like the JBL GO 2 Speaker discounted just 6% on Amazon's U.S. website, compared to between 20%-32% in Germany, Italy, Spain and France.
In the toys category, the Lego Duplo Disney Princess Frozen set, which was not discounted at all on Prime Day 2020 apart from a small price reduction of 10% in France, was discounted 20% in the United States on Monday, compared to 22% in the UK, 28% in Italy and 26% in Spain, a Reuters analysis of data compiled by pricing tool Keepa showed.
Amazon said in a statement, ""Prime members are saving big and taking advantage of the widest selection of deals we've ever had on Prime Day,"" citing hundreds of thousands of promotions Tuesday in the United States.
The company said deals may vary slightly by country.
Amazon's own products saw significant price cuts globally, in line with previous years as the retailer used Prime Day to push its own brands. Amazon's Echo Dot 3rd Generation speaker was discounted by 50% in the United States and United Kingdom, compared to 60% across Europe, consistent with discounting levels in 2019 and 2020. 
SUPPLY CHAIN SNAFUS
Some sellers have reported supply-side challenges this year caused by COVID-19 disruptions that resulted in high shipping costs, limited warehouse capacity and shortages of key items such as chips for electronic goods. 
""With shipping costs up, small to medium-sized sellers don't have enough of a margin to offer the really big savings,"" said Mousumi Behari, digital strategy practice lead at Avionos. 
Casey Ames, founder of Harkla - a maker of sensory products for the disabled - said Amazon cut down the company’s inventory restocking space by 50% overnight last month, limiting the number of products they could sell through Amazon's fulfillment service which offers higher sales and conversion rates. 
""My Prime Day isn't off to the greatest of starts with all of the supply chain issues this year and inventory limitations Amazon placed on us,” Ames told Reuters, adding that he was forced to direct customers to his own website where he has started an “Anti-Prime Day” sale offering deeper discounts than those on Amazon. 
Another U.S.-based Amazon merchant, VersaChalk, said it was not offering any deals on Prime Day this year as ""it really was not profitable anymore.""

The maker of hand lettering and chalk board art materials, which has been selling goods on Amazon for nine years, said that Amazon's inventory limitations have made it difficult to offer really big discounts -which Amazon sets at 20%-25% off the average price –as there is a risk of margin erosion if the products do not do well. 
""We're looking to migrate away from Amazon if anything, even brick-and-mortar retailers. We’re seeing more profit there compared to Amazon,"" VersaChalk’s owner Steve Creasy, said.

The UK-listed firm, whose clients include Norwegian oil major Equinor and Canada's Hibernia, has seen companies cancel new contracts and cut back on existing ones as new COVID-19 variants and lockdowns dampen oil demand.
The Aberdeen-based company said revenue on a like-for-like basis dropped to $3.2 billion in the six months ending June 30.
It also said it expected adjusted core earnings for the first half to be between $255 million and $265 million, a 12% fall from a year earlier. 
Wood, however, sees an improvement in margins in the second half of the fiscal year mainly due to the improving performance of its consulting business, which accounts for about a third of the total revenue.
Strength in the consulting business helped the company's order book rise to $6.9 billion at the end of May, up 6% from December.

Cathay said it had struggled with staff rostering due to Hong Kong's strict quarantine rules on return that have been loosened for crew that have been vaccinated. There are also requirements that only fully vaccinated crews can operate to certain high-risk destinations and on quarantine-free ""bubble"" flights.
Hong Kong has a surplus of unused vaccines and some of the shots are about to expire, city authorities have said.
Cathay said 90% of pilots and more than 65% of cabin crew had been vaccinated already, or had appointments for vaccinations, following a previous warning that vaccination was highly likely to become compulsory.
""We understand there will be some who cannot take a vaccine and we will look into accommodating them on a short-term basis where we can,"" the airline said in a statement.
""However, we will review the future employment of those who are unable to become vaccinated and assess whether they can continue to be employed as aircrew with Cathay Pacific.""
Cathay's new policy was first reported by the South China Morning Post and comes amid varying industry approaches to crew vaccinations.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc said on Tuesday it would mandate full vaccination for crew members flying to countries with high COVID-19 cases at the beginning of August, while Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) last month said all new hires would have to be vaccinated.

Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd has said it will require all passengers and crew to be vaccinated when the country's borders reopen to widespread international travel.
Emirates has provided employees with free vaccines since January, and later told staff they had to get vaccinated or pay for regular tests to prove they are not infected.

The company, formerly known as TransferWise, plans to do a direct listing on the London Stock Exchange rather than sell shares at a set price in advance, with the opening price to be determined in an open auction on the date of admission to the exchange.
Bookrunners said trading was expected to start on July 7 after a management roadshow that begins on July 1.
The London-based payments app, founded in 2010 by two Estonian entrepreneurs, has not given an estimate for how much it expects to be valued at. Sources told Reuters in April it could be worth between $6 billion and $7 billion, making it potentially one of the biggest floats this year.

""Since announcing our expected intention to float last week, we've had over 60,000 expressions of interest in our customer shareholder programme.""

Some technology firms have had a rough ride so far on their London market debuts this year, with Deliveroo and Alphawave both diving on their debuts and still trading well below their listing prices.

Evergrande's shares and some of its bonds have been sold off in recent weeks amid growing investor concerns over its ability to make timely payments. Fitch Ratings downgraded Evergrande on Tuesday with a negative outlook, citing persistent pressure on the company to downsize its business and reduce total debt.
While some of Evergrande's shorter-dated bonds edged higher after Thursday's announcement, its longer-dated bonds slumped, showing investors remain concerned about its outlook. 
The mid-price on its 2.1 billion yuan 5.8% October 2025 exchange-traded bond was last quoted at 64.486, down from 65.150 before the announcement, according to Refinitiv data.
Evergrande ""has operational problems more than liquidity problems,"" said a portfolio manager in Hong Kong.
Shares of Hong Kong-listed Evergrande jumped as much as 8.8% to an almost two-week high in afternoon trade, versus a gain of 0.1% gain in the benchmark. The stock had plunged 18% in the past month to its lowest since March 2020.
Its units, which were also under pressure in the past months, all bounced on the news. Evergrande Property Services rose 6%, while EV unit Evergrande New Energy Vehicle surged over 12%. 
On Monday, Reuters reported that Evergrande had planned to repay its $1.5 billion offshore bond maturing on June 28, ahead of schedule.
The latest company statement said it had also arranged funds to pay $298.7 million in interest on all of its offshore dollar bonds. 

Separately on Wednesday, China Minsheng Banking Group said the risks from its loan exposure to Evergrande were ""within a controllable range"", with exposure having dropped since last September.

The company will allow all users in the United States to shop at major 13 retailers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), by this fall, just ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season, intensifying competition in the sector's biggest market.
""This functionality will be materially incremental to volume and frequency over time in the U.S.,"" said Tim Piper, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Analysts also said that Afterpay's revenue and margins would get a boost from the move, with fees and interchange revenue likely to reach 7% of the transaction, compared with the 4% fee it charges merchants currently. 
""Further, given the non-network merchants can only be accessed through the app, it increases consumers' engagement with the Afterpay app which in our view could unlock further monetisatiion opportunities in the future,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.
The company's shares were trading around A$132.4 on Thursday, outperforming their peers.

Competition, however, is tight in the United States where BNPL firms, including Sweden's Klarna, Zip Co Ltd's Quadpa, and Afterpay, are squaring off against larger financial firms such as PayPal Holdings.
Quadpay will likely bear the brunt of Afterpay's move as customer retention improves, Citi said.

The eleventh generation model of the Civic reflects Honda's company-wide initiative dubbed Honda Architecture, which is aimed to increase the efficiency of development and to expand parts-sharing for mass-produced cars.
Yosuke Sato, development leader for Japan's second biggest automaker, told reporters this month the company utilised Honda Architecture to increase efficiency when developing the Civic's engine compartment by integrating parts and arrangements for components such as an inlet air cooler.
""Successor car models will overall become more efficient,"" Sato said.
Honda said in 2019 that it expected to reduce the number of man-hours spent on developing mass-production models by 30% by 2025 to accelerate its research and development in new technologies such as electrification and autonomous driving. 
Honda has sold more than 27 million Civic vehicles worldwide across 10 different generational models since it was introduced in 1972. The Civic is one of Honda's top-selling cars in the United states.
The new Civic will offer features such as advanced safety and driver-assistance technologies. 

While the Civic will be offered with the choice of a continuously variable transmission or a six-speed manual transmission this time, the carmaker said it plans to roll-out hybrid and sporty type-R versions next year.
Sales of the new Civic will start this fall in Japan and the United States, the company said, with the price to be revealed in August.

Minsheng, one of the major lenders to Evergrande, made the comment on Wednesday evening in replies to investor questions on Shanghai Stock Exchange's E Interaction platform.
Questions about Evergrande's liquidity - it has racked up more than $100 billion in debt - have emerged amid late payment on some of its commercial paper. Credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday downgraded the company's long-term debt to B with a negative outlook, citing ongoing pressure to downsize business and reduce total debt.
Regulators have been asking banks to conduct stress tests on Evergrande, whose debt stood at 716.5 billion yuan ($111 billion) at the end of 2020, making it the most indebted developer in the country. 
In replies to questions on the investor platform, Minsheng said all repayments from Evergrande and its associates have been normal so far, and its loan exposure to Evergrande has dropped since the developer speeded up property sales in September.

It said the overall risk is controllable because most of its loans to the developer are guaranteed by collateral such as land and properties.

Ant, the Jack Ma-controlled fintech group, put on sale two NFT-backed app images via its payment platform Alipay and the items quickly sold out on Wednesday. 
Ant's adoption of non-fungible tokens caused confusion on social media where they were linked to virtual currencies such as bitcoin, which have the same underlying technology.
""Alipay selling NFT products. Isn't that illegal transaction?"" one comment posted on Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) said.
Ant, which is undergoing a government-ordered revamp restructuring after the collapse of its mega-IPO last year, said on Wednesday that non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies were two different things.
NFTs have exploded in popularity this year, with NFT artworks selling for millions of dollars.
""NFT is not interchangeable, nor divisible, making it different by nature from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,"" said a spokesperson at AntChain, the Ant unit that develops blockchain-based technology solutions.
He said that NFTs can be used to create a unique signature for digital assets. 
Winston Ma, NYU Law School adjunct professor, also highlighted the confusion over the nature of NFTs. 
""Are NFTs virtual currencies? Or, are NFTs certificates for virtual currencies? And more importantly, are NFTs securities? These are the questions that no major digital economy's legislature has ever answered,"" Ma said.
In addition to app images, NFT digital artworks are also auctioned on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s platform that can be accessed by Ant's Alipay app. AntChain said in product agreements that it provides blockchain technologies to NFT products.

The artworks are copied in storage space designated by AntChain, and are marked with distinct, blockchain-based certificates that define ownership of the digital assets. 
China has over the past month intensified a campaign against cryptocurrency trading and mining, part of efforts to fend off financial risks.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Thursday morning, with investors continuing to digest the most recent comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials on asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.15% by 10:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.27%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.09%, with the country dealing with its latest, growing COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney.
Hong Kong’sHang Seng Index jumped 1.96%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% while the Shenzhen Component rose 1%. U.S.-China relations are back in the spotlight, however, with the U.S. reportedly planning to bar some solar products made in Xinjiang province.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who previously predicted an interest rate hike in 2022, said that the economy will likely meet the Fed’s threshold for tapering earlier. However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank could slow down the process over the next few months. Neither Kaplan nor Bostic are currently voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee that directs monetary policy.
Fed officials have recently scrambled to reassure markets after its latest policy decision, handed down during the previous week, took a hawkish turn. Recent commentary, including from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, stressed that a loose monetary policy would remain in place, but indicated that a gradual withdrawal of emergency support could happen in the months ahead.
Officials have also indicated that any action is dependent on inflation and employment goals being met. This has triggered a debate among investors on the outlook, with a particular focus on bets tied to accelerating growth.
“You’ve got this inflation issue that has captured the imagination of investors for the first time in a long time,” CIBC Private Wealth Management chief investment officer David Donabedian told Bloomberg. He added that he does not “have a great case for why the market takes another leap forward here over the summer.”
The Fed will also release the results of its latest bank stress tests, and the Bank of England will hand down its policy decision, later in the day.
On the data front, June’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was a better-than-expected 62.6, the fastest pace since 2007 according to records. The services PMI, however, was lower than expected at 64.8.
Further data, including core durable goods orders for May, the GDP for the first quarter and initial jobless claims for the week, are due to be released later in the day. Data on personal spending and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment will follow a day later.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Wednesday that the Treasury could exhaust emergency measures in order to avoid breaching the U.S. debt limit as soon as August 2021. She urged the U.S. Congress to take action to prevent a “catastrophic” potential default."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to approve a bill to give antitrust enforcers more money in a lengthy session on Wednesday, but had still to vote on four bills aimed at reining in Big Tech.
U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called the bills a ""historic package of bipartisan legislation"" aimed at ""reining in anticompetitive abuses of the most dominant firms online.""
After approving bills to sharply increase the budgets of the agencies enforcing antitrust law and to ensure that antitrust cases brought by state attorneys general remain in the court they select, debate began on a bill that would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere
There has been a flurry of opposition to the most sweeping reform bills, including from the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Debate on the portability bill initially focused on whether the legislation was written to ensure it would not affect Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a long-time Google antagonist.
Asked whether any bills were changed to exclude Microsoft, Representative David Cicilline, chair of the committee's antitrust panel and the driving force behind bills aimed at the four tech giants, responded: ""Absolutely not.""
Representative Pramila Jayapal said that it was possible that Microsoft would be covered by the four Big Tech bills, all of which have the same definition of which companies they affect. 
Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to change that definition to say that all online platforms, not just mobile platforms, were covered by the bill.
The four tech giants spent the past two years under federal, state and congressional investigation into how they use their clout to extend their dominance into adjacent markets or abuse their dominance.

Two of the remaining bills address the issue of companies, like Amazon and Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those businesses. One would require the competing business to be sold while the other would require platforms to refrain from favoring their own businesses.
A third would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it could show the acquired company does not compete with it.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street shares were mixed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq closing at a record high, while other major U.S. indexes ended lower alongside European stocks as traders eyed the latest statements from Federal Reserve officials. 
The market has whipsawed over the last week, feeling the aftereffects of the Fed's surprise projection last week for rate increases as soon as 2023, which knocked stocks, boosted the dollar and led to the flattening of the U.S. bond yield curve.
The dollar ended higher, reversing earlier losses on Wednesday as two Fed officials said that a period of high inflation in the United States could last longer than anticipated, a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell played down rising price pressures.
Powell on Tuesday reassured markets by saying the central bank will watch a broad set of job market data to assess the economic recovery from COVID-19, rather than rush to raise rates on the basis of fear of inflation.

Strong manufacturing data and a rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc lifted the Nasdaq, which gained 0.13 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent.
""The market is caught between not knowing what to believe about the coming few quarters, whether a slowdown will emerge,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We’re going back and forth depending on thoughts about interest rates and whether they are going to need to go up faster than expected or not.""
Flash U.S. manufacturing PMI climbed to a record high in June, supporting Wall Street shares in early trade. But manufacturers are still struggling to secure raw materials and qualified workers, substantially raising prices for both businesses and consumers.
Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May, likely hindered by expensive raw materials such as lumber, which are boosting the prices of newly built homes.
""The biggest debate in the market is if inflation is transitory or permanent,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade. ""I would expect this pattern of trading without great conviction to continue with quick adjustments until earnings start.""

The MSCI world equity index rose 0.1%, continuing to climb from the one-month low it hit in the aftermath of the Fed's meeting.
The STOXX 600 was 0.73% lower on the day and the euro retreated 0.1%.
Early PMI data showed that euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years in June as the easing of more lockdown measures and the unleashing of pent-up demand drove a boom in the bloc's dominant services industry.
Germany's private-sector growth was also lifted to its highest level in more than a decade in June, the PMI survey showed. In France, business activity edged higher, but not as much as expected.
In Britain, growth in the private sector cooled slightly from the all-time high hit in May, but inflation pressures faced by firms hit record levels. The Bank of England meets on Thursday.
Berenberg economists Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering wrote in a note to clients that the euro zone economy is likely to recover to its pre-pandemic level of GDP in Q4 2021, while for Britain it will be Q1 2022. 
UBP's Kazmi said that he is positioned for higher yields in Europe, as it overtakes the United States in terms of vaccinations, lockdown easing and economic recovery from COVID-19.
""It will be interesting to see if the German Bund can follow the U.S. rate move with yields moving higher in Europe – it is something that we think could happen,"" he said.
""The fact that the Fed has moved more hawkishly will allow the ECB to be more comfortable perhaps in moving more hawkish, or less dovish, over time.""

Rising oil prices supported the Colombian and Mexican pesos as the dollar extended losses following reassurances that the Fed would not rush into policy tightening.
The Chilean peso led gains among its Latin American counterparts after minutes from the country's latest central bank meeting showed policymakers considered raising the benchmark interest rate.

By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Starlink, the satellite internet unit of Elon Musk's SpaceX, expects to be able to provide continuous global coverage by around September but will then need to seek regulatory approvals, its president Gwynne Shotwell said on Tuesday.
""We've successfully deployed 1,800 or so satellites and once all those satellites reach their operational orbit, we will have continuous global coverage, so that should be like September timeframe,"" she told a Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) technology conference via webcast.
""But then we have regulatory work to go into every country and get approved to provide telecoms services.""
Starlink, which has said it plans to deploy 12,000 satellites in total at a cost of roughly $10 billion, currently offers beta services in 11 countries, Shotwell said.
In May, Musk said the low-Earth orbiting satellite network had received more than 500,000 preorders for its internet service and anticipates no technical problems meeting demand.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission this year approved SpaceX's plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.
Starlink is one of a growing number of makers of small satellites that also includes Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kuiper, Britain's OneWeb, venture capital-backed Planet, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Blue Canyon Technologies.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>",Boeing faces rocky path to gaining approval for 737 MAX return in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu, Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed
BEIJING (Reuters) -Trade power tensions, regulatory hurdles and attempts by the West to counter Chinese competition are delaying a return of the 737 MAX in China, frustrating Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co as a potential rival demonstrates its growing influence.
    Six months after the West lifted an almost two-year flight ban on the MAX, there is no clear end in sight for the crisis surrounding Boeing's fastest-selling jet in China - the first nation to ground it in 2019 after two deadly crashes in five months.
    The company had hoped for China to approve the MAX to return to the sky by the end of last year; in January 2021, Boeing said it expected the MAX to be approved by regulators everywhere by the end of June. Now, with help from the Biden administration, Boeing is stepping up efforts to convince China the plane is safe and reset its most strategic partnership as airlines start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But people familiar with the discussions say regulatory and political obstacles mean any resolution is still months away. For Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun, that means seeing profits and market share slip to European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
""I do know that if it goes on for too long, I pay a price,"" he told a Bernstein conference this month. ""I pay a price because they're (China) the biggest part of the growth of the industry in the world.""
Because of the China uncertainty, Boeing is not confident it can raise production beyond the 31 MAX planes per month level it expects to hit by early 2022, Calhoun said. 
The company has been all but shut out of new orders in the world's biggest aircraft market since 2017, which contributed to its decision to cut production of its long-haul 787 model.
China hopes to compete against Western planemakers, including with its C919, a direct rival to the MAX and other narrowbodies such as the Airbus A320. Its manufacturer, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) is aiming for local certification of the C919 by year end, and is ultimately seeking Western certification.
That potential competition has prompted the United States and Europe to call a truce in a 17-year aircraft trade war so they can focus on challenging Chinese subsidies.
Group of Seven leaders last week scolded China over a range of issues and demanded a thorough probe of the origins of COVID-19, angering Beijing.
    Any improvement in the political backdrop to the MAX decision seems unlikely before the Communist Party's 100th anniversary on July 1, sources and analysts say. 
    ""The 100th anniversary of the founding of the party, the 20th Party Congress next year, the (2022 Winter) Olympics - all of those push China to be less cooperative,"" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
PRACTICAL PROBLEMS
The MAX grounding - after crashes that killed 346 people - has been worst crisis in Boeing's history. Design flaws led to multiple investigations, damaged its reputation worldwide and left it short of cash needed to cope with the COVID-19 crisis.
Yet a year ago, the prospects of China returning the MAX to service on a timeline similar to that of the United States and Europe seemed good.
But politics, practical problems such as visa and quarantine issues, and the Chinese aviation regulator's intense scrutiny have gradually sapped U.S. hopes of a quick solution, industry sources say. 
Last year, engineers from Seattle visited China to answer Civil Aviation Administration of China's (CAAC) technical queries, one of the people said.
Once it was clear CAAC's timeline lagged that of other regulators, Boeing suggested China send representatives to Seattle to observe test flights, two people said, but CAAC declined as the pandemic raged in the United States. 
Discussions shifted to having Boeing's engineers and pilots travel to Beijing for test flights, but six months later that hasn't happened, the first person said.
Boeing said it continued to work closely with CAAC and other regulators to return the MAX to service worldwide but declined to respond to specific questions from Reuters.
CAAC declined to comment about the timeline for approval or the considerations for granting it. But CAAC chief Feng Zhenglin late last year raised concerns about Boeing's pilot training and after-market services in a small group meeting, a third source familiar with the matter said. The source, like others in this article, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
CAUTIOUS REGULATOR
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was also cautious about the MAX's return to service and slapped down efforts by Boeing to speed up the process; Europe's aviation regulator delayed approvals by months. 
CAAC, however, is known in the industry as the most conservative of the world's major aviation regulators. China has not had a deadly commercial air crash in more than a decade.
CAAC was the first regulator to ground the MAX. It has since issued three requirements for the return to service of the MAX in China: certified design changes, sufficient pilot training, and definitive findings from the crash investigations.
Beijing has big long-term regulatory ambitions, according to a State Council blueprint. It aims for China to become a global aviation power by 2050, giving the regulator greater international influence. 
CAAC's most recent jet aircraft certification was with the domestically manufactured regional jet ARJ21, whose production is ramping up after five years in service. It has not been certified by any Western regulator.

In the past, the Chinese regulator would have simply ticked certification boxes under bilateral agreements, a source at a Western aerospace supplier said. But now, as Beijing pins its aviation hopes on the C919, it is asking for detailed and sometimes proprietary data, analyses and presentations.
""CAAC... have put on their big boy pants,"" the source said. ""Now what they're doing in the industry is saying, 'We do not trust traditional certification authorities anymore. We want to learn ourselves what you guys have been doing for the past 50, 60, 70 years.'""

Powell's comments follow the Fed's projection a week ago of an increase in interest rates as soon as 2023, sooner than anticipated. Since then, growth stocks, including major tech names like Tesla and Nvidia, have mostly rallied and outperformed value stocks, like banks and materials companies.

With multiple vaccines currently available in the market, companies are now expanding their production capacities to meet the global demand because several countries, particularly developing ones, are still grappling with the new strains of the virus and their governments are placing a priority on vaccinating their populations.

The assets under discussion include TV channels NFL Network and NFL RedZone, and the league's digital platforms, NFL spokesperson Alex Riethmiller said in an email.
The move aims to expand the reach of the NFL's television networks and digital services as league officials believe there would be greater benefits from media partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. 
NFL has hired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) in the hunt for potential partnerships, according to the Journal, but will retain control of its networks. (https://on.wsj.com/3j4LeIn)
""The NFL has a proven track record of creating leading media platforms that develop significant audiences, so we anticipate speaking to a number of interested parties,"" Riethmiller said, adding that the league would not speculate about potential outcomes until it strikes a deal. 

The NFL in March had signed long-term media deals with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ESPN, ABC networks and others. 
Sports has remained one of the biggest attractions for live viewing even as U.S. audiences are cutting pay-TV subscriptions and migrating to streaming services. Last year, the average viewership of regular-season NFL games fell by about 7% to 15.4 million from a year earlier, according to Nielsen.

(Reuters) - William Ackman, whose blank check acquisition company struck a deal to buy 10% of Universal Music Group (UMG) last week, is exploring options to increase his stake in the music label and already pushing ahead with his next deal, he told investors on Wednesday. 
The billionaire investor who runs hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and who raised the biggest-ever special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) nearly a year ago, described UMG as an ""incredibly iconic, super durable business,"" and said he hoped for a U.S. listing for the world's biggest music label in the future. 
UMG, which is being spun-off by France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), will complete its planned Euronext Amsterdam listing in late September. Ackman said UMG could be listed in the United States through a direct listing on stock exchanges or through sponsored American Depositary Receipts. 
""It is up to the board,"" he said, adding that he wants to own a bigger stake in UMG and is in talks to figure out a way of doing so. 
On a three-hour call with investors, the Wall Street financier, whose moves are closely watched, said he signed a confidentiality agreement earlier this week for his next deal.
As he walked investors in his SPAC called Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) through how the deal with UMG will work, he said he is confident investors will stick with Tontine even if its shares fall below the IPO price. 
Earlier in June, Ackman said he would search for another deal through PSTH Remainco with the roughly $1.6 billion that is left after spending about $4 billion on UMG. Pershing Square funds own roughly 29% of Remainco, which has the option of raising an additional $1.4 billion to complete a future deal.
Even as Ackman is completing the first part, he is working on the second part. He said there were several interesting targets and he had signed a confidentiality agreement with one. 
At 2 p.m. ET, PSTH shares were down 1.7% at $23.32 a share, compared with $21.10 when it launched in June last year.
PERSONAL BET
For Ackman, the investment in UMG is personal, he said. Nearly 100 years ago, his songwriting grandfather, Herman Ackman, sold lyrics that are now owned by UMG. The company represents popular artists such as Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.
The deal with UMG capped a global hunt for a suitable target by Ackman, who considered home rental giant Airbnb and Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab Holdings as targets.
The vehicle ended up being different from most SPACs. They typically are shell companies listed on stock exchanges to raise cash, with the sole purpose of merging with an unknown private company to take it public. 

Investors in Ackman's SPAC will get Universal shares when they are listed but will not be able to exercise their current warrants. Investors will also get rights to buy shares in a Special Purpose Acquisition Rights Company (SPARC) launched by Pershing Square, to do yet another deal down the line.
The SPARC will have $10.6 billion in capital available to spend on a new target. It will have no deadline to spend the money and will eventually be publicly listed, Ackman said.

Renewed investor interest in this industry is evident in the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index’s 64.3% gains year-to-date, versus the broader S&P 500 index’s 13.1% returns over this period.
Bullish market trends in the energy industry should allow participants to generate substantial cash flows, which, in turn, should help them maintain their high dividend payouts. Because the Fed has signaled that the interest rates will remain at near zero level until late 2023, we think it could be wise to bet high dividend paying energy stocks for a steady stream of income.
China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI), and Energy Transfer LP (ET) have solid growth prospects and they pay high dividends. So, we think they are attractive bets now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) said on Wednesday that U.S. manufacturers are ""materially injured"" by imports of passenger vehicle and light truck tires from Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
The ITC also found subsidized passenger tires from Vietnam injure domestic manufacturers.
The U.S. Commerce Department as a result of the order ""will issue antidumping duty orders on imports of these products from Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, and a countervailing duty order on imports of these products from Vietnam,"" the ITC said.
The Commerce Department declined to comment.
The ITC also found imports of tire products from Vietnam sold in the United States at less than fair value ""are negligible and voted to terminate the antidumping duty investigation concerning Vietnam.""
In 2020, the Commerce Department opened investigations into vehicle tire imports from South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in response to petitions filed by the United Steelworkers (USW) representing workers at U.S. tire plants.
The union praised the ITC determination.
""We’re grateful that the ITC affirmed what USW members see every day: a deliberate effort to undercut our domestic industry and overtake our market,” USW International President Tom Conway said in a statement.
Kevin Johnsen, who chairs the USW’s Rubber/Plastics Industry Conference, said that the current system is ""clearly broken."" He added: ""Before we can get remedies, we must demonstrate harm in the form of lost jobs and reduced market share. By that time, American workers are already suffering.""
The union won orders on imported vehicle tires from China in 2015, and Chinese imports have since shrunk dramatically, allowing the domestic industry to invest in new capacity, the union said last year.

The United States imported $4.4 billion in tires from the four nations in 2020. The USW said previously tire imports from the four countries had risen nearly 20% since 2017, reaching 85.3 million tires in 2019.
The USW represents workers at  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Goodyear, Cooper, Sumitomo and Yokohama tire plants in Ohio, Arkansas, North Carolina, Kansas, Indiana, Virginia, New York and Alabama.

(Reuters) -Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he is resigning as a trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and has donated half his wealth to philanthropy since pledging 15 years ago to give away his fortune from running  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa)
Buffett, 90, said in a Wednesday statement he has been an ""inactive trustee"" for years at the foundation, but fully supported Chief Executive Mark Suzman and that their goals were ""100% in sync.""
He did not explain why he is resigning, while noting he has given up all directorships outside Berkshire, reducing his workload.
Buffett also announced a new donation of more than $4.1 billion, comprising nearly 15.2 million Berkshire Class ""B"" shares, to the Gates Foundation and four family charities, part of his pledge to give away 99% of his net worth.
He has since 2006 donated more than $41.5 billion of Berkshire shares, including $32.7 billion to the Gates Foundation. The overall total is now equivalent to about $100 billion because Berkshire's stock price has risen.
""Over many decades I have accumulated an almost incomprehensible sum simply by doing what I love to do,"" Buffett said. ""Society has a use for my money: I don't.""
Founded in 2000, the Gates Foundation focuses on combating poverty, disease and inequity, spending $54.8 billion in its first two decades.
Its future has been uncertain since its namesake co-founders said last month they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) later said it had reviewed an accusation that Bill Gates had tried in 2000 to have an intimate relationship with an employee.
GOVERNANCE COMMITMENT
In an email to Gates Foundation employees, Suzman said he has discussed with Buffett and the Gateses how to strengthen governance and decisionmaking, and planned to share more information in July.
""I am fully committed to following [Buffett's] guidance to ensure we are the best possible stewards of his, Bill, and Melinda's resources,"" Suzman said.
In statements released by the foundation, Bill Gates said he was grateful for his ""enduring friendship"" with Buffett and that ""we will always have a deep sense of accountability"" to him, while Melinda French Gates said Buffett's teachings will help ""chart a way forward.""Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Buffett's donations also go to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the Novo Foundation.
Had Buffett not made his donations, his fortune would roughly equal that of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person according to Forbes magazine.
Bill Gates and Buffett also pioneered ""The Giving Pledge,"" where more than 200 people like Michael Bloomberg, Larry Ellison, Carl Icahn, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal have committed at least half their fortunes to philanthropy.
NO 'SWAN SONG'
Buffett has since 1965 built Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire into a more than $600 billion conglomerate, owning businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance, and stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
He still holds 31.5% of Berkshire's voting power, even after the donations.
Buffett's statement on Wednesday also addressed recent criticism after a ProPublica investigation included him among wealthy people who paid low taxes.
Buffett said his donations have resulted in only about 40 cents of tax savings per $1,000 given.
""Nevertheless, tax deductions are important to many - particularly to the super-rich - who give large amounts of cash or securities to philanthropy,"" he said.

Buffett also used references to American football to assure fans he has no plans to step away, including from Berkshire.
""These remarks are no swan song,"" he said. ""I still relish being on the field and carrying the ball. But I'm clearly playing in a game that, for me, has moved past the fourth quarter into overtime.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower, while the Nasdaq notched a record high Wednesday as a surge in Tesla offset struggles in megacap tech amid an uptick in U.S. bond yields.  
The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.13% at a closing high of 14,271.7, the S&P 500 fell 0.11%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.21%, or 71 points.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 5% to offset weakness in the Fab 5 tech stocks.    
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended lower, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was higher. 
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic confirmed he was one of the seven Federal Open Market Committee members who projected a rate hike in late 2022 reflecting the June summary of economic projections released last week.
Bostic said the economy is close to meeting the Fed's ""substantial further progress"" hurdle to start bond tapering.
The recent bid in tech has been helped by investor bets that a low growth, stable inflation environment is on the horizon. But some warn it is too early to give up on the reflation rate, which tends to benefit economically cyclical corners of the market, as rates are likely to resume their upward projection.
""[W]e believe the U.S. is most likely still within the early-to-mid-stages of a reflationary recovery cycle that can transition toward inflationary growth in the years ahead,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""[T]his reversion back toward low-rate/low-growth can persist over the near-term, [but] rates will eventually resume their modest upward trajectory … this can allow for further multiple expansion in stocks,"" it added.
Energy led the move higher propped up by rising oil prices as data showed weekly U.S. oil fell sharply for a fifth straight week, reflecting strong demand over the summer months.
Crude oil inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 3.9 million barrels.
The advance in U.S. rates helped financials, mostly banking stocks, which tend to benefit from rising rate environments amid a boost to net interest margin.
In vaccine news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was a ""likely association"" between heart inflammation and mRNA vaccines in teenagers and young adults. Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) fell, with the latter down 4%. 
On the economic front, the frantic pace of housing activity appears to be cooling, constrained by supply issues as new-home sales fell by 5.9% to a 769,000 units in May on an annualized basis.
Bitcoin rebounded from its slump below $30,000 a day earlier, helping crypto-related stocks including  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA), and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) end the day higher. "

(Reuters) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Wednesday it had begun a study to evaluate the immune responses generated by COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant or postpartum women.
Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications including premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care and possible death, according to the NIH.
A research study conducted in February in Israel showed that antibodies were detected in all 20 women administered with both the doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine during their third trimester of pregnancy and also in their newborns.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech in February started a separate trial, with 4,000 international volunteers, evaluating safety and effectiveness of their COVID-19 vaccine in healthy pregnant women. 
The NIH study, MOMI-VAX, will measure the development and durability of antibodies against the coronavirus in women vaccinated during pregnancy or the first two postpartum months.
The researchers will assess vaccine safety and also evaluate whether vaccinated pregnant women pass along protection to their babies via the placenta or breast milk. 
Many pregnant women in the United States have already received the COVID-19 vaccine available under emergency use authorization. 
""The results of this study will fill gaps in our knowledge and help inform policy recommendations and personal decision-making on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director (NIAID) Dr Anthony Fauci said. NIAID is financing the study. 

The trial will enroll up to 750 pregnant and 250 postpartum women within two months of delivery, who have already received or will receive a COVID-19 vaccine authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The FDA has authorized vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for emergency use.

PARIS (Reuters) -Regulators have called for more rigorous checks when pulling some Airbus jets out of pandemic storage, following flawed cockpit readings that can suggest blocked sensors.
Pilots rely on airspeed readings derived from external probes known as pitot tubes, which can become blocked by insect nests or dirt if they are not properly sealed during storage.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said in a safety directive covering the Airbus A320 family that ""an increasing number of operational disruptions have been reported due to airspeed discrepancies"" as they return to the air.
A spokesperson said the events included commercial flights and in most cases led to aborted takeoff. ""EASA had no reports of any resultant injuries, aircraft or system issues,"" she said.
Asked whether passengers had been on board, an Airbus spokesperson said it did not have a breakdown between passenger, freight or technical check flights.
The reports prompted Airbus to carry out further computer simulations which suggested that problems with two out of three sensors may affect the plane's stability during take-off, though none of these events happened in operations, EASA said.
The Airbus spokesperson said these follow-up actions were precautionary and that safety was its chief priority. 
EASA first reported an ""alarming"" rise last August in the general number of cases of unreliable cockpit indications during the first flight of jets leaving storage. It called on operators of all makes and models of passenger aircraft to be vigilant.
The unprecedented number of aircraft grounded as lockdowns blocked air travel - at one point reaching two-thirds of the global fleet - had already created a spike in problems as airlines began returning them to service last year.
Pilot rustiness, maintenance errors and a loss of expertise in the supply chain due to job cuts have also raised concerns.
Airbus says it has set up a COVID-19 safety task force aimed at safely rebooting activities from airlines to factories.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has previously said extensive preparations must be carried out to return jets to service from long-term storage.
Blocked pitot tubes, which are a routine hazard on most civil and military aircraft, are just one item on a list of potential snags after months of storage - along with rodents, bird nests and even snakes and scorpions in desert parking strips. 
Ducts that carry air from the front of most engines to the cabin's air-conditioning systems can also be contaminated.

Airbus has beefed up audits of its supply chain following the crisis. In March, it warned suppliers of risks from parts being stored incorrectly or corroding, industry sources said.
It also raised the alarm over a range of risks including ""foreign object damage"" caused by parts or tools lying around unnoticed because of greater social distancing in factories.

So, we think it’s wise to now bet on NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) and Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW). These names possess solid growth attributes and are expected to generate significant returns in the coming months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nespresso, the premium coffee division controlled by Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), has not increased prices for its capsules yet despite a sharp increase in benchmark prices for arabica beans, opting to wait and see if the upward trend is sustainable over time.
Alfonso Gonzales Loeschen, the Chief Executive of Nespresso North America, said in an interview on Wednesday the company has so far absorbed price increases instead of passing on the higher costs to consumers, until there is more clarity about the market direction.
""It will all depend on how long these higher prices will be maintained,"" Loeschen said.
Benchmark arabica coffee prices on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) exchange hit the highest since November 2016 earlier this month, due to smaller production in top grower Brazil and disruptions to the supply chain.
Nespresso, as well as other premium coffee processors, usually pay a large premium over New York futures to associated growers around the world, as a way to guarantee supplies of the best coffees.
The CEO, who took over the job in the U.S. early in 2020 just weeks before the pandemic led to lockdowns, said direct sales to consumers increased 20% during the period, forcing the company to adjust to higher online sales and logistics demand.

Its boutique coffee stores are all open again, but sales to offices are slow and he does not see volumes on that selling channel recovering to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2022.
""It seems that only around 20% of workers are back to offices, and many people will keep working in a hybrid system,"" Loeschen said, adding that some companies supplied employees working from home with Nespresso packages during the pandemic, a new selling point for the Swiss firm.

Shares of software firm Alfi were last down 24.4% at $12.32 after more than doubling in price to close at $16.29 in the previous session. 
Analysts and social media users had pointed to an article on Benzinga.com, which quoted the company’s CEO and said Alfi would buy back $2 million of its shares, as a catalyst for Tuesday’s move.
Alfi confirmed this on Wednesday, announcing board approval for repurchases of up to $2 million. The stock pared some losses after the news before losing ground again.
Another retail darling, Torchlight Energy was down 26% on Wednesday, after a 29% slide in the previous day's session after it increased its stock offering to $250 million.
Shares of a group of heavily shorted companies including video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc have seen wild swings this year in a phenomenon dubbed the ""meme stock"" rally that has been driven by retail traders on online discussion forums. 
Although short interest in Alfi was at 3.85% of its free float at the end of May, according to the latest Refinitiv data, the company was among the top 10 trending stocks on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits, a platform commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors. 

GameStop has also cashed in on the Reddit-driven rally in its stock, saying on Tuesday it had raised $1.13 billion in its latest share offering. Its shares were down 1%, after a 10% gain in the previous session. 
Another meme stock, Clover Health Investments Corp was up 7.4% in high-volume trading while ContextLogic Inc was down 0.3% and AMC shares were basically flat.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail investors bought more stocks on Friday than at any other time on record, taking advantage of a sharp drop in share prices, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said on Wednesday. 
Net inflows from individual investors into equities were $2.05 billion on Friday, Vanda analyst Giacomo Pierantoni and senior strategist Ben Onatibia said in a note to clients.
The move was spurred by the recent recovery of stocks favored by retail traders and a rotation out of cryptocurrencies that led millennials to reengage with equity markets, they said.
The S&P 500 fell 1.31% on Friday and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.92%, after a U.S. Federal Reserve official suggested the U.S. central bank might raise interest rates sooner than previously expected.
While retail investors bought the dip, especially exchange-traded funds like the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SI:SPY) and Invesco QQQ, as well as financials, materials and energy stocks, institutional investors were sellers, the Vanda analysts said.
""Hedge funds unloaded their massive positions in value stocks after the FOMC and nobody else but retail wanted in,"" they said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee.
Individual investors ramped up their stock market activity starting in November 2019, when most large brokerages dropped their trading commissions. Retail activity accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking in the first quarter of 2021.
Retail engagement is likely to remain well above pre-pandemic levels going forward, based on the results of a survey of around 500 individual investors, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said on Wednesday. 

""Ease of access, improved technology, product innovation (i.e. fractional shares) and low costs are some of the factors that give us confidence around this sustainability,"" Jefferies analysts said in a client note. 
Around 70% of those surveyed by Jefferies said that in a normalized economy they would either not alter or would increase their trading activity.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 struggled Wednesday as the rally in tech took a breather amid a slight climb in U.S. bond yields, though downside was limited by rising energy and consumer discretionary stocks.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.08%, or 27 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.27%, and had hit an intraday record high of 14,317.7.
Technology stocks, which had a strong session Tuesday, helping the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at record highs, gave up some gains amid a slight uptick in U.S. bond yields.  
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were higher, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was flat.
The uptick in United States 10-Year comes as Federal Reserve officials continued to talk up the prospect of earlier rate hikes.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic confirmed he was one of the seven Federal Open Market Committee members who projected a rate hike in late 2022 reflecting the June summary of economic projections released last week.
Bostic said the economy is close to meeting the Fed's ""substantial further progress"" hurdle to start bond tapering.
The recent bid in tech has been helped by investor bets that a low growth, stable inflation environment is on the horizon. But some warn it is too early to give up on the reflation rate, which tends to benefit economically cyclical corners of the market, as rates are likely to resume their upward projection.
""[W]e believe the U.S. is most likely still within the early-to-mid-stages of a reflationary recovery cycle that can transition toward inflationary growth in the years ahead,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""[T]his reversion back toward low-rate/low-growth can persist over the near-term, [but] rates will eventually resume their modest upward trajectory … this can allow for further multiple expansion in stocks,"" it added.
Energy led the move higher, shrugging off a retreating crude prices from session highs despite data showing weekly U.S. oil fell sharply for a fifth straight week, reflecting strong demand over the summer months.
Crude oil inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 3.9 million barrels.
The advance in U.S. rates helped financials, mostly banking stocks, which tend to benefit from rising rate environments amid a boost to net interest margin.
In vaccine news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was a ""likely association"" between heart inflammation and MRNA vaccines in teenagers and young adults. Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) fell, with the latter down more than 3%. 
On the economic front, the frantic pace of housing activity appears to be cooling, constrained by supply issues as new-home sales fell by 5.9% to a 769,000 units in May on an annualized basis.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, rebounded sharply from its slump below $30,000 a day earlier, helping crypto-related stocks including  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA), and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) move higher."

719,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 02:18PM ET</span>","A Longtime Fidelity Manager Sold GameStop, and Has Some Regrets","(Bloomberg) -- Joel Tillinghast has managed the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund since it was created about 32 years ago, hunting for companies with shares that trade at bargain prices relative to their earnings potential. In 2020, a suffering video-game retailer called  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). fit that bill.
So when the company’s shares suddenly started moving higher at the start of the year, he did what his more than three decades of value-investing experience told him to do: he sold the fund’s entire stake for a profit. And yet, after seeing the staying power of the rally in meme stocks fueled by Reddit forums, even Tillinghast has some regrets.
“Sometimes I multiply the difference between the sale price and the current market price by the number of shares that I had, and of course I kick myself,” Tillinghast said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s Baystate Business. “But the comforting thing of being a value investor is I also feel like, well, I sold it for somewhat more than my estimate of fair value and that’s what I meant to do.”
The $33.5 billion Fidelity fund had about 2 million shares of GameStop at the end of October, regulatory filings show. That’s when the Grapevine, Texas-based company’s stock traded at just above $10. By the end of January, at which point the fund had exited its position, GameStop had reached as high as $483. It hasn’t climbed back to that level since then, closing at $220.40 on Tuesday.
Tillinghast didn’t say at what price he sold. However, another fund that he manages, the $14 billion Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund, held 6.8 million GameStop shares as of Oct. 30 that were valued at $71.2 million, filings show. It sold the entire stake by the end of January for a total of $333.8 million, or about $49.08 a share.
“It felt like when the stock was in the single-digits, there was no question that the stock was undervalued, even though it was fundamentally challenged and they were lagging in their efforts to market digitally,” Tillinghast said of GameStop. “But when the stock rallied above my estimate of fair value, I sold it.”
Investors continue to grapple with what lessons, if any, to take away from the runaway rally in GameStop shares that astonished Wall Street. Since then, message boards on Reddit helped push up the price of other favorites like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. Both GameStop and AMC have taken advantage of retail-trader enthusiasm to raise money by selling more shares.
So far this year the Fidelity low-priced fund is up about 19%, beating 84% of its peers. Over a five-year period it ranks in the 27th percentile, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tillinghast’s exit from GameStop didn’t stop him from winning Morningstar Inc.’s outstanding portfolio manager award this week. Robby Greengold, a Morningstar strategist, noted in a release that Tillinghast “doesn’t chase fads.”

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Zurich Insurance Group AG (OTC:ZURVY) is expecting a ""strong rebound"" in profits in 2021 and may sell books of life business closed to new customers, the head of Europe's fifth-largest insurer said on Wednesday.
Insurers across the globe were hit by claims from COVID-19 last year, but the impact of the pandemic on earnings was waning, Mario Greco, chief executive of Zurich, said in an interview at the Reuters Future of Insurance USA conference.
""What we see so far is a strong rebound, the business is coming back very strongly in growth and profitability,"" he said.
To see the video, click: https://vimeo.com/566597204/7502db0e55
Greco said the insurer was ""constantly looking"" to sell books of European life insurance business closed to new customers, after several such transactions in recent years.
""We continue assessing if it is the right time for us to dispose or not,"" he said.
Zurich is looking to offload an Italian portfolio of closed life insurance policies with an equity value of around 200 million euros ($239.20 million), Reuters reported earlier this month.
Zurich is also looking to sell its German life back book business, several sources told Reuters.
Greco said the insurer would consider closed life portfolio sales ""not necessarily only in these two countries"".
But Greco said the firm planned only to be ""opportunistic"" in making any acquisitions, rather than setting aside a specific M&A budget.
""Our strategy is defined in that it's not counting on acquisitions, but we do have capabilities,"" he said.
""We could deploy capital that will contribute to our work and targets...As soon as we see an opportunity, we are in a position to go for that.""
Zurich and Farmers Exchanges last year agreed to buy MetLife (NYSE:MET)'s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion.
Zurich is also taking steps to limit risk in its cyber insurance policies, Greco said.
""Cyber has not been an issue for ourselves financially, we've been really careful in underwriting cyber risk.""
Businesses worldwide are fighting sophisticated data scientists as they battle to protect their data-rich computers from cyber crime - and the costly attacks are not going to stop, a top expert at insurer Sompo Holdings Inc told the conference on Tuesday.

PARIS (Reuters) -A French court has set Sept. 17 as the date for hearing a case brought by the finance ministry against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over allegedly abusive contractual terms imposed by the tech giant for selling software on its App Store.
The case, judged by Paris' commercial court, is unlikely to lead to a significant fine if Apple is found guilty, based on previous similar cases. But the court could compel the iPhone maker to change some of its App Store contractual terms. 
A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment. 
The case echoes a complaint by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, which is engaged in multiple lawsuits across the world against Apple since a dispute over app payment commissions surfaced last year. 
The ministry's lawsuit comes after a three-year probe by the DGCCRF consumer fraud watchdog, which comes under the remit of Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who ordered the investigation.
In France, the law allows the finance minister to sue companies when abusive business practices are found in contracts. 
France's leading startup lobby France Digitale has joined the case, according to a court document seen by Reuters. 
""We're going to find ourselves in a 'heads you lose, tails I win' situation,"" said Nicolas Brien, the head of the European startup network and chief executive of France Digitale. 

""Either the commercial court condemns Apple, and it will be unprecedented ... or Apple gets away with it, and it will be proof that current laws don't allow the regulation of a systemic platform like Apple.""
Further hearings could follow and no date has been yet set for the court's decision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may require public companies to publish data on a whole range of new areas, including greenhouse gas emissions, workforce turnover and diversity, as its new chairman looks to enhance the SEC's disclosure regime.
Gary Gensler, SEC chair, told a financial services industry audience during the annual London City Week he has also asked staff to consider potential requirements for companies that have made ""forward-looking"" climate commitments and have significant operations in foreign jurisdictions with required climate-related targets.
""I've asked staff to propose recommendations for the commission's consideration on human capital disclosure.

Gensler also said he had asked staff to explore structural changes to the U.S. Treasury cash and repo markets which have experienced a handful of liquidity crunches in recent years. 
While the Federal Reserve has previously suggested https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-treasury-markets-analysis-idUSKBN28Q1EV introducing central clearing was an option to help grease the wheels of the Treasury market, Gensler said he had asked staff to ""consider the potential benefits"" of clearing -- signaling a potential shakeup for the world's largest market long term.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court again tightened the reins on organized labor on Wednesday, declaring in a case brought by two fruit companies that a decades-old California regulation that let union organizers enter agricultural properties without an employer's consent violated constitutional property rights.
The 6-3 ruling, with the court's conservative justices in the majority, overturned a 2019 lower court decision throwing out the challenge to the regulation by the companies in the most populous U.S. state. The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision.
The court found that the regulation, which gave union organizers access to the companies' workers, was akin to the government taking private property for public use without just compensation in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. 
The challenge was brought by Dorris, California strawberry producer Cedar Point Nursery and Fresno-based Fowler Packing Company, which ships grapes and mandarin oranges. The justices made clear that any limitation on the ability of owners to exclude others from their property without compensation is unconstitutional. 
""The access regulation grants labor organizations a right to invade the growers' property. It therefore constitutes a per se physical taking,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.
The California Agricultural Labor Relations Board regulation, in place since 1975, had allowed union organizers, with notice to regulators and the employer, to enter agricultural premises to talk with employees for three non-working hours per day during four 30-day periods each year. The organizers did not require an employer's consent.
It marked the latest setback for unions at the Supreme Court, which in 2018 ruled in another case that non-members cannot be forced, as they are in certain states, to pay fees to unions representing public employees such as police and teachers that negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers. 
'PROTECTS EVERYONE'S FREEDOM'
""Today's ruling is a huge victory for property rights,"" said Joshua Thompson, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group that represented the companies. 
Cedar Point owner Mike Fahner said, ""This decision protects everyone's freedom to decide for themselves who is - and is not - allowed on their own property.""
The regulation's defenders had argued that such a sweeping ruling could hurt not just union organizing but also food, factory and social work inspections, or even Border Patrol entries onto private property to enforce immigration laws. 
In a dissenting opinion, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer emphasized the temporary nature of the union activity in this case. 
""The regulation does not appropriate anything. It does not take from the owners a right to invade (whatever that might mean),"" Breyer wrote. 
Breyer also said the ruling could undermine other regulations requiring government officials or others to enter a property. 
""Most such temporary-entry regulations do not go 'too far.' And it is impractical to compensate every property owner for any brief use of their land,"" Breyer added.
The two fruit companies had sought to halt enforcement of the regulation. They challenged it after disputes with the United Farm Workers, a union whose history traces back to the famous labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, who died in 1993. 
On Twitter, the union said the ruling failed to balance farmers' property rights with farm workers' civil rights. 
""Farm workers are the hardest-working people in America. This decision denies workers the right to use breaks to freely discuss whether they want to have a union,"" it said.
Unions have said the rule in practice afforded them little time to reach workers during the narrow window of seasonal farm work either before or after work. They have said that farm workers often are migrants who change job sites frequently and may not understand English or Spanish, making work site access one of the only ways to inform them of their labor rights. 
Both companies called the regulation outdated. They said farm employees are easier to reach than ever, including through smartphones and radio stations, and that nearly all of their 3,000 workers can communicate in English and Spanish.
Organizers disrupted work on Cedar's property with bullhorns, while Fowler was accused of denying organizers access, drawing a complaint with regulators, according to the lawsuit. 

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the challenge. 
Former President Donald Trump's administration had backed the companies. Democratic President Joe Biden's administration reversed the government's position.

We think investing in growth stocks  Pfizer  (PFE) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) could generate better returns. Let’s discuss.Although Elon Musk’s support helped Dogecoin benefit from a skyrocketing rally earlier this year, the cryptocurrency has plunged more than 30% over the past month with China's intensifying crackdown on cryptocurrencies on concerns over massive energy consumption in the mining process and illegal activities using these digital currencies. Because these are deemed legitimate concerns, governments around the globe might follow China and implement their own restrictions on cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s indication that it may increase interest rates sooner than previously anticipated could create put more pressure on risky assets like cryptocurrencies. So, we think the prospects for Dogecoin look bleak.
In contrast, quality growth stocks are gaining investor attention amid the economic recovery given their ability to grow faster by capitalizing on supportive fiscal and monetary policies. This is evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 4.4% returns over the past month compared to the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 2.1% loss and the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.2% gain over the same period. According to The Conference Board, the U.S. real GDP is expected to rise 9% in the second quarter of 2021, which bodes well for growth stocks.

Low-cost carrier Southwest took an aggressive strategy during the pandemic, launching service to more than a dozen new cities and sealing a major aircraft order with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. It has said it expects to stop burning cash by June.
""The challenges more than anything are executing as we come out of the pandemic,"" Jordan told Reuters.
""We have a lot of hiring to do and it's a very competitive hiring environment out there,"" he said.
Jordan, 60, joined the airline in 1988, and has served in roles including director of revenue accounting and corporate controller, among others. He will take charge effective Feb. 1, 2022.
Kelly, 66, became the CEO in 2004, has led Southwest through some of the airline industry's most turbulent times over its 50-year history.
As CEO, he spearheaded several initiatives, including the acquisition of AirTran Airways, the launch of international destinations for the first time in Southwest's history, and the introduction of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 into the airline's fleet.
Jordan was also involved in the AirTran deal and led the development of the company's new e-commerce platform and its Rapid Rewards loyalty program.
During the pandemic, he played a key role in reducing the airline's labor costs and avoiding layoffs and furloughs, the company said.
Southwest's shares were down 0.8% at $55.32 in early afternoon. The stock has more than tripled in value during Kelly's tenure.
""There’s a lot to step into,"" Jordan said, adding that his first areas of focus will be ensuring a stable transition and getting out with team members.
Southwest did not consider any external candidates for the job, Kelly said.
""We’ll continue to stabilize the company coming out of this pandemic and be ready for what I hope will be a really strong 2022 with a lot of momentum,"" he said.
This is the latest transition at the top at a major U.S. airline.
Rival United Airlines last year named insider Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) to succeed Oscar Munoz to the top job. 

Kirby landed at United from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) in 2016 after the board passed over him as a potential leader.
Following Kirby's departure, American elevated Robert Isom, then chief operating officer, to the role of president. Isom is heir apparent to American Chief Executive Doug Parker.

728,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 12:58PM ET</span>","In Paris without tourists, LVMH unveils Samaritaine store revamp","By Silvia Aloisi
PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH unveiled on Monday the revamped La Samaritaine, a 150-year-old department store designed to help it grab a greater slice of tourist spending once pandemic travel curbs are eased.
After a seven-year makeover, the historic store will reopen to the public on June 23 and rival the likes of Galeries Lafayette, housing a hotel, restaurants and shops. Its reopening, originally scheduled for last year, was delayed by the coronavirus emergency.
With contagion rates falling in most of Europe, France began to lift restrictions in mid-May but foreign travellers, particularly non-Europeans, are still largely absent.
Spending by visitors to France remains a major source of income for high-end brands, even if Chinese shoppers, the industry's number one clientele, have been buying a lot more at home during the pandemic - a shift expected to outlast the health emergency. 
LVMH, behind fashion and accessories labels like Louis Vuitton, makes 8% of its 45 billion euros sales in France alone, and already owns upmarket Parisian department store Le Bon Marche.
Its latest venture, with 20,000 square meters of shopping space, sits on the banks of the Seine, close to tourist magnets like Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre museum.
La Samaritaine is famed for its 1920-era building and gilded Art Deco facade but the revamped store will include a 100-metre airport-style moving walkway through a tunnel to nearby parking.
Facing competition from online retailers, department stores were seeking to reinvent themselves as day-trip destinations even before the COVID 19 pandemic. The crisis has forced several prestigious U.S. names to file for bankruptcy.
Eleonore de Boysson, the Europe and Middle East head of DFS Group - a retail and duty free company majority owned by LVMH which runs the department store - said it may take one or two years for tourists to return en masse to France. La Samaritaine expects around 5 million visitors a year when things go back to normal.
""We wanted to reopen at a time when life is starting to come back,"" she said. 
The store will host 600 brands, of which 50 exclusively, and offer shoppers a wide range of prices. 
It hopes to rival peers like Qatari-controlled Printemps and family-owned Galeries Lafayette. Some 37 million shoppers visit the latter's main store in Paris every year.
LVMH, which first snapped up a stake in La Samaritaine in 2001, has spent 750 million euros on its makeover, which includes a contemporary, undulating glass exterior on one side by Japanese architectural duo SANAA. 

The store had to shut its doors in 2005 as its original glass flooring was not sufficiently fire-resistant.
The complex will include a luxury rooftop hotel and be home to 96 flats under a social housing scheme.

Investing.com – Ford Motor (NYSE:F) shares rose more than 3% in Wednesday’s trading after it said that its electric vehicles, namely Mustang Mach-E GT and Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition, had more than met the ranges set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Ford’s global director of battery electric vehicles Darren Palmer said he was pleased that more than half of the orders for the Mustang Mach-E GT are for the Performance Edition.
The sportiest of Mach-E variants, Mustang Mach-E GT, will go 270 miles on a full battery. Mach-E GT Performance Edition will do 260 miles with the same full-battery charge.
Mustang Mach-E GT is retailed at $59,900 and the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition at $64,900 in the U.S. Deliveries of the vehicles will begin in the fall.
Barclays (NYSE:BCS) had on Tuesday raised Ford’s target to $17 while reiterating its overweight rating on the company. The target is now 10.5% away from the current price of $15.38.

Sam Woods, head of the BOE’s Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority, told U.K. lawmakers on Wednesday that British regulators’ probe into the collapse would likely conclude within the next month.
“From that will flow various bits of supervisory action and there may be policy as well,” Woods said, adding that watchdogs globally are in “live discussion” about their response. “From the banking end, I think we do need to overhaul the ways these types of exposures are managed within the banking sector.”
The implosion of Archegos in March led to multibillion-dollar losses and a slew of senior departures from the banks that handled its business. The BOE, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are among authorities considering action, including whether to force banks to reveal more about their risky trading positions.
Crypto Capital
Woods also said the BOE was supportive of the recent Basel Committee proposal to put the maximum risk weighting on banks’ holdings of Bitcoin. While he believes stablecoins tied to real assets could have a role in the broader economy, he took a dim view of the utility of cryptocurrency.
“I don’t think that will ever be suitable as a currency because of the likely enduring nature of the extreme volatility in its value -- I just don’t see how it’s going to be useful,” he said. Woods is watching the experiment with crypto in El Salvador, but is “deeply skeptical about that, certainly for the U.K.”

In a statement following a meeting in Sicily, the ministers said they wanted to avoid any misclassification of the employment status for such gig workers that ""might prevent them from accessing the same protections and rights of employees"". 
The G20 meeting comes as the European Union is set to propose an EU-wide regulatory framework by year-end, and courts and regulators have sought to address perceived shortcomings in the gig economy. 
Trade unions blame outsourcing and the use of workforce management algorithms on international digital platforms for an erosion of rights and wages. 
The G20 ministers committed also to promote employment for women beyond the goal of reducing labor market participation gaps by 25% by 2025, as set in Brisbane in 2014 by G20 leaders.
""The new commitment is simply to promote employment for women, with particular attention to job quality and remuneration and tackling the gender pay gap,"" said the Italian labor minister Andrea Orlando who chaired the meeting.

The labor ministers also discussed shifting work practices in the wake of the new coronavirus pandemic.
""Smart working offers workers the possibility to better reconcile work and private life, but they must be guaranteed the same protection and opportunities as in-office workers, and especially the so-called right to disconnect,"" the G20 ministers said in the joint statement.

As such, we think it could be rewarding to bet now on fundamentally sound homebuilding stocks Skanska (SKBSY),  Tri Pointe Homes  (NYSE:TPH), and Hovnanian (HOV). These names are well positioned to benefit from the recommencement of building projects. Read on.The demand for new homes has increased significantly over the past year, with buyers looking to relocate from cities to suburban locals for bigger living spaces amid the remote working trend. This, along with a surge in interest in existing-home renovation and do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, has led to soaring demand for lumber. As the demand for lumber increased last year, the production capabilities of sawmills remained limited due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. Consequently, lumber prices have soared over the past year.
However, according to industry trade publication Random Lengths, the cash price per thousand board feet of lumber fell 27% last week from its $1,515 all-time high, which it hit on May 28.This can be attributed primarily to increasing production at sawmills as major economies continue to reopen and mill workers return to their jobs. Consequently, several homebuilding projects that were put on hold due to high lumber prices are expected to resume in the near term.
So, based on these factors, we think it could now be wise to bet on the shares of established homebuilding companies Skanska AB (SKBSY), Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. (TPH), and Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:HOV). They are expected to generate significant returns in the coming months.

By Ludwig Burger and Aishwarya Nair
(Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance remain broadly effective against Delta and Kappa variants of the COVID-19 causing virus, which were first identified in India, according to a scientific study, underpinning a continued push to deliver the shots. 
The study by Oxford University researchers, published in the journal Cell, investigated the ability of antibodies in the blood from people, who were vaccinated with the two-shot regimens, to neutralize the highly contagious Delta and Kappa variants, a statement said. 
""There is no evidence of widespread escape suggesting that the current generation of vaccines will provide protection against the B.1.617 lineage,"" the paper said, referring to the Delta and Kappa variants by a commonly used code.
However, the concentration of neutralising antibodies in the blood was somewhat reduced, which may lead to some breakthrough infections, they cautioned.
Last week, an analysis by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta variant. 
""We are encouraged to see the non-clinical results published from Oxford and these data, alongside the recent early real-world analysis from Public Health England, provide us with a positive indication that our vaccine can have significant impact against the Delta variant,"" AstraZeneca executive Mene Pangalos said in a separate statement.
The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said on Friday. 
The Oxford researchers also analysed the likelihood of reinfection in people who had previously had COVID-19. 
Looking at the ability of antibodies in their blood samples to neutralize the variants, the risk of reinfection with the Delta variant appeared particularly high in individuals previously infected by the Beta and Gamma lineages that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, respectively.

By contrast, previous infection with the Alpha, or B117, variant first detected in Britain, conferred ""reasonable"" cross-protection against all variants of concern, lending itself as a template that next-generation vaccines could be molded on. 
""B117 might be a candidate for new variant vaccines to provide the broadest protection,"" the researchers said.

(Reuters) - Global companies are set to ramp up their expansion plans this year, after being bogged down in the last few years, as economies recover from the pandemic and firms start to see higher profits and cashflows.
According to an analysis of Refinitiv data for 4100 global non-financial firms with a market value of at least $1 billion, estimates show their cumulative capital expenditure is set to grow 10% this year, the most in a decade, before slowing in 2022. 
Graphic: Global capex growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwmzzopw/Global%20capex%20growth.jpg 
Analysts expect lower borrowing costs, governments' infrastructure spending and global transitioning to green energy to boost corporate capex this year. 
""Corporate capex is on an accelerating path this year, given the strong rebound in corporate profitability, where profits have tended to lead capex pretty consistently,"" Mislav Matejka, head of global and European equity strategy at JP Morgan, said in a note.
""Further, bank lending standards are continuing to improve, which helps capex decisions,"" he said.
The Reuters analysis showed the companies' combined free cash flows rose to $331.96 billion in the first quarter of this year, which is a decade high.
In the past few years, global companies have preferred to use their cash piles on share buybacks and repaying debt rather than investing in capex due to uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade tensions and the COVID-19 crisis.
However, Anik Sen, global head of equities for PineBridge Investments based in New York, said companies would tend to spend more heavily on capex this year.
""Historically, capex was not rewarded with a higher share price due to the long payback periods,"" he said.
""(But) the nature of capex today, such as automation, digitalization, shift to cloud, have significantly shorter payback periods with high internal rate of returns which flow through to higher cashflow expectations in the mid-term."" 
The analysis showed European companies are expected to see a 13% increase in capex this year, compared with 11% for U.S. firms and 9.7% for Asia Pacific.
By sector, tech firms are estimated to raise their capex by 17.4%, while consumer discretionary firms and utilities sector firms are set to see an increase of 17.3% and 13.8%, respectively.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced earlier this year it would spend $20 billion to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity, while  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group said that it will spend about $18 billion over the next three years on strategic investments.
The analysis showed developing markets may lag on capex growth this year as they are still struggling with vaccinations and have higher corporate debt levels. 
The data showed that emerging market firms are likely to post capex growth of just 8% this year, far below that in developed economies such as the United States and Europe. 
""Very clearly, capex in the emerging world will not grow as fast as there will be credit constraints, the more so when the Fed starts tapering,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis.

Analysts also said companies would allocate more money to renewable energy projects, as they face pressure from governments and investors to turn carbon neutral in coming years. 
""Companies are under the scrutiny of investors to show progress on their greenhouse gas intensity,"" said PineBridge's Sen. ""Asset managers, in turn, are being held to account by asset owners to engage with companies on ESG issues.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Record-breaking dealmaking in Canada is encouraging investment banks to beef up staffing, but the increased demand for bankers is forcing some to pay up in unique ways to attract new hires.
Canadian mergers and acquisitions (M&A) year to date surged to a record $206.5 billion and IPOs hit an all-time high of $5.6 billion, according to Refinitiv, after the pandemic crushed dealmaking in the first three quarters of 2020.
HSBC, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) are expanding their M&A teams.
""It continues to be an active market with lots of active discussions with clients going on as well, and so that has absolutely spurred on a need to fortify the ranks within the teams,"" said Scott Lampard, head of global banking for HSBC Bank Canada.
HSBC plans to boost overall investment banking headcount by 20%-25%, mainly at the analyst level to support pitching and executing deals, Lampard said.
PENT-UP DEMAND
With the pace of transaction expected to continue at pace, banks are paying more to hire and retain existing teams, offering a range of new services, like sending in a consultant to create the ideal home office, recruiters say.
""We've been doing this for nearly 20 years and we've never seen a market like this,"" said Bill Vlaad, CEO at recruitment firm Vlaad and Company. ""Everybody is scrambling,"" 
""Many of the banks have increased base salaries quite dramatically, mostly in 2021,"" he said, adding salaries had increased 20%-40% across M&A roles.
""Now if you want to attract, you have to put something else on the table."" 
To poach talent, banks are adding signing bonuses, extra vacation days, healthcare increases, special programs for mental wellness and home office perks, all tailored to individual requests, Vlaad said.
TD Securities,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), CIBC World Markets are the top M&A advisers year to date. All three declined to comment on hiring plans.
Of the top deals announced this year, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc's C$20 billion ($16.2 billion) bid for Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) Inc and Canadian National's bid $33.6 billion offer for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) are the two biggest. 
Despite the pandemic, five of the top six Canadian banks paid an average of C$3.1 billion ($2.50 billion) in total bonuses last year, up from C$2.9 billion ($2.34 billion) in 2019, an analysis of filings by Reuters showed.
Headcount at National Bank Finance will be up by four or five people in M&A versus the same time last year, David Savard, head of M&A at the bank, told Reuters. 
That put the team at 28 for the large-cap M&A team and 10 for the mid-market team, he said, adding both areas were ""booming"".
""There seems to be some pent-up demand for entrepreneurial-led companies and private companies doing M&A coming out of COVID,"" he said. 
David Rawlings, CEO for JPMorgan Canada, agreed headcount would be likely higher in the near future.

""We think activity will continue to be strong and are currently looking to selectively hire with a particular focus on senior diverse candidates,"" said Rawlings.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego expects to begin selling toy building bricks made from recycled plastic bottles in 18 to 24 months, having found a suitable green alternative to oil-based plastic, the Danish toymaker said on Wednesday.
Lego's search for an alternative material has been a challenge, with almost 150 engineers and scientists testing many different plant-based and recycled materials over the past six years.
""We are super excited about this breakthrough,"" said Tim Brooks, Lego's vice president of environmental responsibility. 
""We want our products to have a positive impact on the planet, not just with the play they inspire, but also with the materials we use."" 
Lego, which uses some 100,000 tonnes of plastic in its products each year, said it will use recycled material from plastic bottles that are certified as safe to handle beverages in Europe and the United States. 
A one-liter plastic water bottle will yield about ten standard Lego bricks.
Since 2018, the company has made some of the less rigid parts of Lego sets, such as plants and trees, from bio-polyethylene made from sugarcane.
But using such materials for harder bricks has proven challenging, while maintaining the shape, feel and safety for children.
Lego said last year it would invest $400 million over three years to step up efforts to use sustainable materials and that it aimed to replace plastic bricks with ones made from sustainable materials by the end of the decade.
Lego has applied for a patent on its mix of recycled plastic bottles and a strengthening additive. So far, the bricks have a slight grey tint, but the company is refining the material colour and how the bricks grip together.

The company expects to bring the prototype 2x2 and 2x4 bricks to market in 18 to 24 months and will continue to test the material on various brick types.
Rival toy maker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), best known as the maker of Barbie dolls, in 2019 announced it aimed to produce its plastic toys from recycled, recyclable or bio-mass plastics from 2030.

And as the global economy continues to emerge from the pandemic-induced recession, we think the rising demand for oil should fuel CLR’s growth and help the stock maintain its momentum in the near term. So, let’s take a closer look.Shares of Oklahoma City, Okla.-based crude oil and natural gas producer Continental Resources, Inc.

According to Grand View Research, the global business software and services market is expected to grow at an 11.3% CAGR between 2021 -2028.

LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - British pilots, cabin crew, travel agents and other workers are urging politicians to save the summer holiday season by reopening routes abroad or risk destroying tens of thousands of jobs as companies fail.
Workers from the travel industry demonstrated across Britain on Wednesday. Protesters outside parliament held banners saying ""Speak up for travel"" as pilots and air stewardesses from British Airways, easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Virgin Atlantic lined up in full uniform, to highlight the threat to their jobs from the government's strict rules.
England is expected to re-open from a third COVID-19 lockdown in July but the travel sector remains effectively shut, with the government advising against travel except to a handful of destinations.
British government ministers are examining ways to re-open travel more broadly, and are considering plans to ditch quarantine requirements for vaccinated adults and their children to some destinations.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that whatever happens, it will be a difficult year for travel.
The industry says the rules need to be eased urgently to prevent more jobs being lost.
Brian Strutton, acting General Secretary of the British pilots union BALPA said it was make or break time for the sector. 
""If we lose this summer as well, I don't know how some of the travel companies, some of the airlines, are going to be able to survive, because with no money coming in, how can they continue to run their operations?,"" he said in an interview.
To survive more than 15 months of travel restrictions, companies including British Airways, easyJet, TUI and Jet2, have taken on billions of pounds of debt. 
""Airlines are at the absolute limit of what they can borrow and without a genuine reopening this summer they will require government support to survive,"" the chief executive of industry group Airlines UK Tim Alderslade said.
Airlines are also ramping up pressure on the government to ease its travel rules by joining legal action, led by Manchester Airports Group. England's High Court ruled the case an urgent matter this week.
RED TRAFFIC LIGHT
Under the government's traffic light system, only travellers to a small number of green-list countries can avoid quarantine.
Popular European holiday destinations for Britons, including France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United States, are rated amber and require returning passengers to take three expensive COVID-19 tests and isolate for 10 days on return.
The industry urged the government to expand the green list when the system is reviewed on June 28.
COVID-19 rules restricted the numbers permitted to attend the Westminster protest to a few hundred who held up placards with pictures of flip flops and planes saying ""Give safe travel the green light"". There were also events at Manchester, Heathrow and other airports. 
At the Westminster protest, Kelly Cookes, leisure director at Advantage Travel told Sky News the industry's future was ""hanging in the balance"" and said she was expecting companies to fail without rule changes.
Another protester said that now was the time to help the family-owned businesses that help make up Britain's large and once vibrant travel industry. 
""Look at our livelihoods, we've sold everything, we've borrowed money, we're in debt,"" he said to gathered crowds. 

Airline bosses have said that they could be ready for a wider re-opening of travel within weeks should government rules change. 
But even if Britain eases its rules, airlines and tour operators could still face a challenge as the spread of the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus has prompted other countries to place restrictions on British arrivals.

(Reuters) -GSK set out plans on Wednesday to turn its consumer healthcare arm into a separately listed company, in a move that will deliver an 8 billion pound ($11 billion) windfall and other financial benefits for its underperforming drugs business. 
Investors have been waiting for details of the separation, which was first unveiled in December 2018 when GSK agreed a joint venture for consumer brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). 
The British group also gave details of a research pipeline which it says has benefitted from the restructuring work of chief scientist Hal Barron, but said it would pursue deals as well to further improve its drug development prospects. 
The split planned for the middle of next year will allow GSK to focus on its core drugs and vaccines business, which has been hit by a lack of fast-growing products and patients deferring treatments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, weighing on its shares.
Despite being the world's biggest vaccines maker by sales, GSK has also been beaten by the likes of Pfizer,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) to making a COVID-19 vaccine. 
""I am very aware that GSK shares have underperformed for a long period,"" CEO Emma Walmsley told a news conference, adding she would stay at the helm of the pharma and vaccines business called New GSK. 
""Together, we are now ready to deliver a step-change in growth for New GSK and unlock the value of Consumer Healthcare,"" said Walmsley, who has been in charge since 2017. 
Pressure has been increasing on the CEO following a report in April that activist investor Elliott had taken a multibillion-pound stake in GSK. 
SALES GROWTH
GSK is currently valued at about 10.3 times its forecast core earnings, including net debt, below an average of more than 12 for global pharma majors, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. 
GSK forecast the pharmaceuticals business would increase sales by more than 5% a year to 2026, broadly in line with analysts' current expectations. 
It said that business was expected to receive a dividend of up to 8 billion pounds from the consumer arm, which will have its own listing on the London Stock Exchange.
As a result, the consumer operations will take on a higher share of debt of up to four times its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
New GSK will have a ratio that is below the current group level of about two.
For even more financial fire power, the combined 2022 dividend of the two businesses will be reduced by 31% and, once separated, New GSK will distribute 40%-60% of earnings, down from more than 80% expected for the group this year.
GSK shares were up 2.3% at 1343 GMT, as analysts pointed to a smaller dividend cut than some had feared. 
GSK shareholders will receive stock in the new consumer healthcare group amounting to at least 80% of the 68% stake that GSK currently owns in it. 
New GSK aims to sell the its remaining stake, described as a short-term investment, ""in a timely manner,"" the group said. Based on brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF)' valuation of 45 billion pounds for the whole consumer unit, that would be worth about 6 billion.
Pfizer, owner of the remaining 32%, has also said it would seek an exit. 

""We will continue to monitor and evaluate all alternatives,"" it said on Wednesday.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>",Factbox: How GSK plans to fire-up its cash balance post split,"(Reuters) - Britain's GSK set out detailed plans on Wednesday to turn its consumer healthcare arm into a separately listed company, in a move that will bolster the finances of the remaining business to help fund drug development and deals. 
Below are the ways in which the pharmaceuticals business will strengthen its balance sheet as a new company. 
PRE-SPLIT DIVIDEND
Prior to completion of the split, New GSK, the standalone prescription drugs and vaccines business, will get a special dividend of up to 8 billion pounds ($11 billion) from the consumer healthcare unit. 
GSK finance chief Iain Mackay said on a media call this dividend would be the ""most significant"" component of its plans to achieve a robust balance sheet for New GSK.
SALES AND PIPELINE
Over the five years to 2026, New GSK expects annual sales growth of more than 5% and adjusted operating profit growth of more than 10%, at constant currency rates.
The company also estimates that some of its products in late-stage development have the potential in aggregate to deliver peak year sales of more than 20 billion pounds, leading to an overall annual target of more than 33 billion pounds in sales by 2031, despite some drugs losing patent exclusivity.
STAKE SALE
GSK shareholders will receive stock in the new consumer healthcare group amounting to at least 80% of the 68% stake that GSK currently owns in it.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has the remaining 32%.
GSK aims to sell its remaining stake, seen only as a short-term investment, ""in a timely manner.""
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts have put the consumer unit's fair value at about 45 billion pounds, implying GSK's 68% stake is worth 30 billion pounds, with proceeds from selling 20% of that likely to be 6 billion pounds. 
NEW DIVIDEND POLICY
From 2023, New GSK will pay shareholders a dividend of 45 pence per share. For 2022, the aggregate dividend from GSK and New Consumer Healthcare is expected to be up to 55 pence per share.
Both the figures are much lower than the 80 pence per share GSK has been paying out since at least 2015, and is expected to pay this year too. 

""Setting a new progressive policy at a level that allows us to properly balance those priorities around investing in strengthening our R&D pipeline"" would help New GSK's balance sheet, Mackay said.

LISBON (Reuters) - As the summer holiday season kicks off, the number of passengers hopping on Ryanair (I:RYA) planes is ""mushrooming"" despite travel restrictions in place to control the spread of the coronavirus, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday. 
In an interview with Reuters ahead of a news conference in Lisbon, O'Leary said bookings had recovered very strongly over the last eight weeks, with particularly high volumes of bookings to Portugal and other summer destinations from Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries.
""Traffic is mushrooming and a lot of that folk are families going on summer holidays to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy,"" O'Leary said, adding the airline was on track to fly 80 to 100 million passengers by March 2022.
That is up from 27.5 million last year but still below pre-pandemic levels of 149 million. O'Leary said Ryanair carried 1.7 million passengers in May and said the number was likely to increase to 5 million in June and 9 million the following month.
To boost travel further, O'Leary said fully vaccinated holidaymakers across Europe should be allowed to travel freely. 
Britain allowed vacations again from May after months of lockdown but discourages travel to popular holiday destinations such as Spain, France, Greece and the United States, classifying them as ""amber"" under its ""traffic light"" system.
Last week, Ryanair launched a legal challenge against Britain over the traffic light system, hoping to force a relaxation of the rules. 
Britons returning from European holiday destinations, including Spain, Portugal and Greece, that are currently rated ""amber"", have to take multiple COVID-19 tests and isolate for 10 days.
O'Leary said the UK and Ireland were opening to travel ""more slowly"" compared with other countries.
""They are terrified to allow people to travel but I think it will be resolved,"" he said, adding he believed the UK would join the EU's proposed digital certificate travel scheme, which will potentially be in use by July 1.

Coronavirus cases are on the rise in Britain but also in Portugal, particularly in Lisbon, mostly due to the Delta variant. O'Leary said the increase in cases would not have a big impact on Ryanair.
""There might be some disruption in Lisbon but we think it will be reasonably small and it won't last long because of the vaccinations taking place all over Europe,"" O'Leary said.

The analyst thinks positive estimate revisions can add to the upside in the stock. The stock has risen over 93% in the last year.
Thein said it is too early to call for an end of the business upcycle and he would selectively lean in to the sector on the back of the recent pullback. United Rentals fell about 5.5% over the last month-and-a-half.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>","El Salvador bitcoin plan ""bulletproof"", president says","By Tom Arnold and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - El Salvador is determined to push ahead with making bitcoin legal tender, a process that will bring only small risks and prove a ""leap forward for humanity"", the country's President Nayib Bukele said in an interview with a bitcoin journalist.
El Salvador this month became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in a move taking effect in September.
Speaking in the interview released on Wednesday, Bukele said the move would boost jobs and economic development to the Central America country.
He said he was confident the project would be a success - despite the World Bank declining to offer technical support and concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund.
""It looks bulletproof,"" he said in an hour-long interview with bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack. ""I'm pretty sure this is going to work, not only for us but for humanity, because it is a leap forward for humanity.
Bukele said the move would lessen El Salvador's reliance on the U.S. dollar, the existing legal tender. 
""(We will be) at least becoming a little less dependent on the output of new dollars, and the new inflation that's coming with those all those new dollars,"" he said.
There was no plan to hold bitcoin in national reserves, though that might happen ""probably in the future"", he said.
The World Bank declined to give assistance to El Salvador's bitcoin implementation given the environmental and transparency drawbacks.
""Having the World Bank, advisers or technical support would have been nice, but we really don't need it,"" Bukele said, adding local talent was more than enough. 
He acknowledged there might be some risks to the push. 
""But I really do not see them as big risk, only probably getting some people angry at us but they haven't been so nice to us anyway, so you know, why not try something new?""
Analyst have voiced concerns that the bitcoin push could endanger the country's request for an $1 billion programme to the IMF. The fund has voiced economic and legal concerns regarding the move, though Bukele said his government had spelled out its plan and would offer more explanation if needed.
""We adopted the U.S. dollar in the year 2001, what's the difference?"" he asked. 
""The only difference, probably, is the reasons why we're doing this. In 2001 it was probably done for the benefit of the banks and this decision is done for the benefit of the people.""
Bukele also said he had received a lot of interest from parties over exploiting renewable energy from the country's volcanoes to build a bitcoin mining hub.

""We have discovered new (geothermal) wells that will give us 95 megawatts, which is not huge but still quite considerable,"" he said. 
A bitcoin mining plant would be built at a cost of $480 million, he said, while bitcoin would pay for infrastructure from schools to bridges.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Atlantia will use most of the 8 billion euros ($9.6 billion) of proceeds from selling its motorway unit for deals and helping its subsidiaries invest rather than paying down their debts, a senior source within the group told Reuters. 
The infrastructure group had around 40 billion euros of consolidated net debt at the end of 2020, leading some analysts to expect part of the money would be used to clear borrowings. 
However, the source, who declined to be named, said some of the funds would be used to help subsidiaries do deals and invest so they can generate cash to service and pay off their own debt.
For example, Spanish toll-road subsidiary Abertis, which alone had nearly 24 billion euros of debt last year, could be used as a platform to pull together other motorway concession businesses.
Atlantia's other subsidiaries include Rome airports operator AdR, Nice airport operator ACA and toll-road digital payments group Telepass. 
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, agreed this month to sell its 88% stake in motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia in a deal that will end a dispute sparked by the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge in Genoa.
The deal is expected to complete in 6-8 months.
Last week, Atlantia said it would return to paying dividends and spend up to 2 billion euros on a share buyback, but was silent on debt.
The source said Atlantia Spa, the holding company at the top of the group, had already reduced its own net debt to 2.75 billion euros this year, from above 4 billion euros in 2020, and its earliest bond maturity was September 2023.
Consolidated debt is manageable since it is divided among subsidiaries and managed by each of them, the source added.

On Tuesday, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's upgraded Atlantia, Autostrade and Aeroporti di Roma (AdR) following the deal to sell Autostrade.

Tesla does not have a showroom in Tibet, a remote and long-impoverished region. In its post, the company cited the ample sunlight in the mountainous area as behind the move.
China is Tesla's second-biggest market, but the charging site is its first in the country with dedicated solar power and on-site power storage. China's power grid is predominantly fueled by coal.
The carmaker moved into the solar business in 2016 with its $2.6 billion purchase of California-based SolarCity, and has said it is keen to develop its energy business.

The company's solar services include Solar Roof, a power generating system meant to look like normal roof tiles, and Powerwall, which can store power generated by solar panels.
Last year, Tesla, which makes electric vehicles in Shanghai, put out job advertisements for solar and energy storage project managers in China.

(SEDG) is a designer and seller of direct current optimized inverter systems for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations internationally. The stock’s price has climbed 68.4% over the past year thanks to an increase in demand for residential and commercial solar installers.

Although the company has been expanding its offerings by entering strategic partnerships and delivering powertrain kits for the e-mobility sector in Europe, it has failed to grow its revenues and profitability.
Moreover, for the second quarter of 2021, SEDG expects its non-GAAP gross margin to be within a 32% - 34% range.

Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman said the risk of an increase in U.S. capital gains taxes has led to explosive growth in potential targets for his alternative investment firm, as corporate owners look to cash in ahead of any legislative changes.
“It’s really like an avalanche now of opportunities -- people want to sell things before their taxes are much higher for selling the same thing, potentially next year,” Schwarzman said in a virtual panel discussion at Bloomberg’s Qatar Economic Forum. “It’s giving us a lot of opportunities, and what we have to do is be careful, always have a very exciting plan for growth.”
Blackstone, along with  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc. and Hellman & Friedman LLC, reached an agreement earlier this month to buy a majority of Medline Industries Inc. for more than $30 billion, in what would be among the largest leveraged buyouts of all time. Bloomberg News reported this week that the Mills family was motivated to sell some of their stake in one of the nation’s largest private companies in part because of the threat of additional capital gains taxes.

It’s not just taxes: Higher corporate valuations are also a strong motivator for people to sell their businesses, Schwarzman said.
“The U.S. economy is really on fire, almost everything is growing much faster than almost anyone anticipated,” he said.
Americans may face persistently higher inflation than they’ve been accustomed to because employers have had to pay to bring workers back in front-line industries, Schwarzman said. That aligns him with other speakers at the forum, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and billionaire investor Ray Dalio, who see a risk of overheating and inflation.
Schwarzman said wages are “most concerning” because the benefits that workers have received through stimulus programs have discouraged some from returning to work.
“It’s very difficult to reduce people’s compensation,” he said. “So I think some of the inflation will be baked in at higher levels than we’ve certainly experienced in the past decade.”
Schwarzman chose to deflect a question on crypto: “I leave that to Elon Musk,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A global securities watchdog plans to publish its first regulatory guidance for raters of corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in July to stem growing concern among asset managers about overstated green credentials.
The concern over so-called greenwashing has grown as more investments are channelled into climate-friendly funds, giving rise to a burgeoning market for ratings on how different companies deal with ESG challenges.
Ashley Alder, chair of the IOSCO body that groups securities regulators from the United States, Europe and Asia says that many countries have no rules for ESG raters. 
""Many on the buy and sell side have signalled very clearly how confusing the multiplicity of different ESG ratings choices can be, again raising serious questions about relevance, about reliability and about greenwashing,"" Alder told City & Financial's City Week event on Wednesday.
""We are now working on ways to ensure better transparency and clearer definitions. Our work is likely to involve guidance to service providers and ratings agencies, together with recommendations for regulators on how to deal with potential conflicts of interest.""
IOSCO expects to publish a report mid-July.
The watchdog also wants asset managers to incorporate more meaningful climate-related considerations into their risk management as the companies in which they invest face more stringent ESG disclosure rules.
""It's critical for providing quality information to end investors,"" Alder said.
IOSCO is working with the IFRS Foundation on setting up a new body by November to write mandatory global standards for company disclosures on climate change.
IOSCO members such as the United States and the European Union would continue working on their own disclosure rules, creating some differences, Alder said.

It is essential, therefore, that these domestic approaches become fully interoperable with the global baseline being developed by the IFRS to avoid conflicts and the creation of more ""noise"" in the system, Alder added.
""We can't simply work in jurisdictional silos when the climate emergency does not respect national boundaries. Global investors need global comprarability,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Auto transport firm Gefco has been put up for sale by owners Russian Railways (RZhD) and carmaker Stellantis in a deal expected to be worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.39 billion), people close to the matter said. 
The owners are working with JP Morgan and Rothschild on the divestiture, they said, adding potential buyers have already been asked to log their interest. 
Gefco, its owners and the banks declined to comment.
Gefco is expected to post earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of 345 million euros on sales of 4.4 billion this year, one of the sources said.
In 2020, factory and dealership closures and delayed purchases by consumers due to the pandemic led to a 20% slide in turnover to 3.8 billion euros, while recurring EBIT fell 32% to 140 million.
Car markets have since rebounded and European car registrations surged 74% in May, rising for the third month in row.
Stellantis remains Gefco's main customer, accounting for roughly half of its revenue, and has already flagged that it will reduce its business with Gefco, weighing on the company's valuation, the people said.
While many listed logistics peers trade at more than 10 times their expected core earnings, Gefco is expected to be valued at significantly less than 10 times, one of the sources said.
France's PSA Group sold a 75% stake in Gefco to Russian Railways in 2012 for 800 million euros. PSA rebranded as Stellantis last year after its merger with FCA.
Founded in 1949, Gefco employs 11.500 staff in 47 countries. It tried to float on Euronext in 2019, but had to scrap plans on muted investor interest.
The company sells transport services to Stellantis, Ford,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Skoda and Toyota, but also other companies such as Nestle and Electrolux. 
In September, a global cyberattack on Gefco made headlines and Gefco said in its annual report published in May that it made significant progress in rolling out a new IT system.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has said he would present a business plan for Stellantis in late 2021 or early 2022, as he is working to deliver on a synergy target of more than 5 billion euros a year.
Stellantis this month floated French used car group Aramis.

Russian Railways, initially planned to expand its logistics business after buying Gefco, but a few years later changed course, selling Russian railway logistics container operator Transcontainer.

A date for a hearing is likely to be set either later next week or for the following the week, added the spokesperson.
The travel industry remains effectively closed as rules require 10 days quarantine for arrivals from all European Union countries and the United States. Government advice also warns against travelling to most countries. 

British pilots, cabin crew, travel agents and other workers are urging politicians to reopen foreign routes with protests and demonstrations across the country on Wednesday.
The government said in an emailed response its travel rules sought to balance the reopening of international travel with safeguarding public health and protecting the country's vaccine programme.

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A $500 million U.S. fund to compensate relatives of 346 people killed in two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes has opened, the claim administrators told Reuters on Tuesday.
The fund, which opened on Monday, is part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.  Boeing Co  in January agreed to pay $500 million to compensate the heirs, relatives and beneficiaries of the passengers who died in Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2018 and 2019. 
Each eligible family will receive nearly $1.45 million and money will be paid on a rolling basis as claim forms are submitted and completed, said administrators Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros in a joint statement. Families have until October 15 to complete claim forms.
The Justice Department and Boeing declined to comment.
The fund is part of a $2.5 billion Justice Department settlement reached in January with Boeing after prosecutors charged the company with fraud over the certification of the 737 MAX following a Lion Air crash on Oct. 29, 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines disaster on March 10, 2019.
The settlement allowed Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution but did not impact civil litigation by victims’ relatives that continues. 
In July 2019, Boeing named Feinberg and Biros to oversee the distribution of a separate $50 million to the families of those killed in the crashes and the new fund's distribution follows a similar formula.
While Boeing has mostly settled Lion Air lawsuits, it still face numerous lawsuits in Chicago federal court by families of the Ethiopian crash asking why the MAX continued flying after the first disaster.
The DOJ settlement includes a fine of $243.6 million and compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane’s flawed design.
The Justice Department said in January, ""Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.""
Some lawmakers say the government did not go far enough, while Boeing says it has taken numerous steps to overhaul its safety culture.
Congress ordered a major overhaul of how the FAA certifies new airplanes in December and directed an independent review of Boeing’s safety culture.

The 737 MAX was grounded for 20 months after the two fatal crashes. The FAA lifted the order after Boeing made software upgrades and training changes.
Last month, Boeing agreed to pay a $17 million FAA fine after it installed equipment on more than 700 Boeing 737 MAX and NG aircraft that contained sensors that were not approved. ""The FAA will hold Boeing and the aviation industry accountable to keep our skies safe,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said.

Speaking at a joint press conference in Berlin after meeting German counterpart Heiko Maas, Blinken said Washington was determined to see if it can make something positive out of a difficult situation and strengthen Europe's energy security.
""Our goal remains to ensure that Russia cannot use energy as a coercive tool as a weapon against Ukraine, or anyone else in Europe,"" Blinken said.
Washington is against the Nordstream 2 pipeline which would double Russian gas exports across the Baltic Sea. 
The project, now about 95% complete, would help Russia curtail gas exports via Ukraine, depriving Kyiv of lucrative transit fees.
Germany, a key NATO ally with which Democratic President Joe Biden has sought to repair relations frayed during the administration of former Republican President Donald Trump, wants to complete the $11 billion pipeline.
A U.S. State Department report sent to Congress in May concluded that Nord Stream 2 AG - the company behind the pipeline to Germany - and its CEO, Matthias Warnig, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, engaged in sanctionable activity. 

But Blinken waived those sanctions, saying that this was in the U.S. national interest.
Maas said Berlin wanted a solution that is acceptable for both sides. ""We know the expectations in Washington. It is extremely important for us to achieve results that Washington can also support.""

784,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",Manufacturers have an answer to higher costs: Pass them on,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - In 2018, Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) swung to a loss after a tariff-fueled rally in U.S. steel prices drove up its raw-materials costs. 
This year, it is paying $1 billion for steel and other materials, but the West Michigan appliance maker is on track to post its highest profit in decades.
The difference? Booming demand, spurred by nearly $6 trillion in pandemic stimulus from Washington - more than the country's World War Two budget - and consumers flush with savings.
With so much money coursing through the economy at a time when the pandemic-induced disruptions have constrained supplies and prevented a buildup in inventories, companies are able to charge higher prices without hurting sales. 
Whirlpool has raised prices by as much as 12% this year in various markets to compensate for increased raw-material costs. Many other manufacturers that make goods ranging from heavy equipment to SUVs are using a similar playbook.
It helps explain why corporate profits have soared to the highest level in a decade, even though factories across the United States are starved of components and prices for everything from steel to oil to labor and computer chips are surging.
An analysis by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) shows S&P 500 companies surpassed analysts' profit expectations in the first quarter by the biggest margin in history even as ""inflation"" found more mentions on earnings conference calls than at any time since 2011.
""We're in this weird market where there's a shortage of everything,"" said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). ""When you're in that sort of shortage situation ... you're willing to pay more.""
Soaring prices are testing the U.S. Federal Reserve's jobs-first monetary policy as inflation is now projected to exceed its 2% target by a wide margin this year and remain slightly elevated for the next two years. The Fed, however, still attributes the run-up in prices to ""transitory"" factors.
A SUPPLY-DEMAND MISMATCH
A sharp correction in lumber prices has raised hopes that other commodities would follow a similar trajectory once demand and supply start to rebalance. Raw-materials producers, however, say a roaring economy will keep prices relatively high.
The current economy fulfills, almost too well, the ubiquitous dream of manufacturers - a world in which supply and demand are finely balanced so that prices always stay firm and sales do not collapse. 
For manufacturers serving the Big Six appliance categories - washers, dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers and ranges and ovens - demand is the strongest in at least 12 years, according to data from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).
But it is taking appliance makers at least two to three months to fill new orders because steel, semiconductors and resins are in short supply, said Kevin Messner, head of AHAM's government relations and policy.
Whirlpool's average order backlog is about six to seven weeks, compared with one to two weeks normally. The company did not respond to requests for an interview. But Chief Executive Marc Bitzer told investors in late April that the order backlog would remain elevated because of ""unconstrained"" consumer demand and restricted access to components.
FEWER DEALS
Data from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shows the average discount on appliances around Memorial Day weekend this year was just 7%, lower than 19% a year ago. Whirlpool was the least promotional, with discounts of only 2%, down from 9% a year ago, the data showed.
The price cuts are expected to be equally modest for the Fourth of July holiday, according to sales executives at  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Best Buy stores in Chicago.
""Prices have gone up and some items are out of stock,"" said one of the sales executives.
The benefit to corporate profits from what amounts to a double-digit price hike is ""fantastic,"" said David MacGregor, president at Longbow Research LLC.
In the auto industry, too, reduced production due to shortages of semiconductors has resulted in the lowest levels of unsold cars and trucks on dealer lots in years, according to consulting firm AlixPartners.
In response, discounts as a percentage of a vehicle's price were slashed to less than 8% in May from more than 12% in early 2020, AlixPartners said. And the average prices have gone up globally by nearly $1,700 a vehicle, offsetting much of automakers' cost increases.
Tight inventories ""allowed this pricing power. It's allowed OEMs (automakers) to move the mix to more profitable vehicles,"" said Mark Wakefield, co-head of AlixPartners' automotive practice.
Both General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have raised their profit outlook - a contrast from 2018 when higher steel prices hurt their earnings.
CONSTRUCTION BOOM DRIVES DEMAND
In the heavy farm and construction machinery industry, companies say customers already are placing orders for next year to try to beat the price and delivery crunch.
Industry sales of construction machines in North America are projected to be up 25% this year. The sales are expected to grow next year as well on the back of a buoyant housing market and higher infrastructure spending.
Stephen Roy, head of sales in the Americas for Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY), says the company is prioritizing orders from customers over those meant to replenish inventories at dealerships. Supply bottlenecks have tripled the lead times for its products.
The company is facing intense cost pressure, but customers have been willing to accept higher prices.
""They seem to be able to pass along price increases to their customers,"" he told Reuters. ""So far, we don't hear any concerns from our customers.""
To be sure, not all companies are able to flex their pricing-power muscle. 

Take Pennsylvania-based startup Optimus Technologies. The biodiesel engine maker is grappling with higher raw-material costs, but has been unable to fully pass them along to its customers.
Chief Executive Colin Huwyler says his company needs to be cost-competitive to increase its market share. ""We have some unique challenges that maybe an OEM manufacturer would not have,"" he said.

Investing.com –  Carvana  (NYSE:CVNA) shares were down 2% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘overweight’.
Analyst Rajat Gupta maintained his $325 target for the stock, still an upside of 3.8% from its closing level of $313.10 on Tuesday.
According to Gupta, the stock has hit a near-term top.
Gupta said they continue to like the company’s disruptive business model and related long-term growth potential, but “. . .we believe the recent rebound in shares coupled with a meaningful pull back in brick & mortar auto retailers, makes the near-term relative risk-reward less favorable.”
Shares of the auto e-commerce company are up nearly 146% in the past 12 months, outperforming the broader market.
The online retailer of used cars has benefited from a number of factors in recent months. People returning to work after the pandemic have been reluctant to use public transport, and a global shortage of semiconductors has crimped availability of new models at dealerships across the U.S. All that has squeezed prices so hard that used cars have been largely responsible for the rise in overall consumer prices in the last two months. 
Prices of used cars and truck prices climbed 7.3% in May after a surge of 10% in April, a 68-year record.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 07:08AM ET</span>",Analysis: From game-changer to back-up- J&J's COVID vaccine struggles in Europe,"By Francesco Guarascio, Emilio Parodi and Matthias Blamont
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - At the height of Europe's vaccine supply crisis in March, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s (J&J) single-dose COVID-19 vaccine was touted as a game-changer. But two months into its rollout, the shot has the lowest uptake of all four approved vaccines. 
Supply problems, safety concerns, improved deliveries of rival vaccines and countries' inoculation strategies have all played a part in holding back usage. 
Despite the shot's clear logistical advantage of not requiring a booster, the European Union has only administered about half of the delivered doses - an uptake rate much lower than any rival COVID-19 vaccine, including AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s, which has also been dogged by supply and safety issues.
That is bad news for J&J, and also raises questions about the efficiency of the EU's inoculation campaign, as the bloc's drugs regulator insists the shot can save lives.
Supply problems in particular have soured the mood in Brussels, which has already decided not to take up an option to order 100 million additional doses of the J&J vaccine, and has not yet decided whether to exercise a second one for another 100 million shots which lapses at the end of June. 
EU sources say that if ordered, the extra doses will most likely be donated to countries outside the bloc. 
The shot has also struggled in the U.S. market. 
HIGH HOPES
Three months ago, the situation was very different. 
""A single dose vaccine can make a difference in the speed of rollout,"" EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on March 11, the day J&J's shot was approved for use in the EU.
At that time, the 27-nation bloc's vaccination drive was struggling, largely due to big cuts in expected supplies from AstraZeneca. And the J&J shot, initially expected to arrive at the start of April, was seen as crucial to building momentum. 
Despite a two-week delay in the rollout, EU officials were still upbeat. ""The vaccine will massively accelerate the pace in the EU,"" the bloc's top lawmaker on health matters, Peter Liese, said on April 12.
But two months later, only about 12 million doses have been delivered to the EU out of the 55 million expected by the end of June. Production problems at J&J subcontractor Emergent led the EU to refuse about 20 million doses this month, and the bloc does not expect J&J to meet delivery targets.
Of the doses supplied, only about half - or around six million - have been administered, according to data from the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), the lowest uptake of the four COVID-19 shots approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
By comparison, as of Tuesday, over 90% of the about 250 million vaccines shipped by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its partner BioNTech have been administered, and nearly 85% of the over 30 million  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) doses have been used.
Around 75% of AstraZeneca's nearly 70 million delivered shots have also been injected into EU arms. 
In France, the EU's second most populous country, the uptake of J&J's vaccine was half the bloc's average - at just 22% of the delivered doses in mid-June, a French health ministry official said, whereas the utilisation rates for the Pfizer and Moderna shots were well above 80%, and over 60% for AstraZeneca.
The gap is even more striking when considering the stock of these two-dose vaccines needs to be managed carefully to ensure a second dose is available within the prescribed interval. Such precautions are not needed for the single-dose J&J vaccine.
A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the low uptake, while adding the Commission and governments were ""for the moment of course disappointed with the numbers of deliveries, but they hope that these deliveries will increase over time.""
J&J has repeatedly said it will deliver the 200 million doses ordered by the EU, but has declined to comment on the second-quarter target and on the low uptake. 
VACCINE FOR THE ISLANDS
One reason for the low usage is that the J&J shot was briefly suspended, and has faced some restrictions, due to its links to very rare, but potentially fatal, blood clotting. 
AstraZeneca's vaccine has faced similar safety-related hurdles and stricter limitations on its use in the EU, but still has a higher take-up.
However, AstraZeneca's potential safety issues emerged only after it had been administered to many people in Europe, whereas J&J's possible side-effects were known even before its rollout on the continent, after its deployment in the United States.
""There is no strategic reason for the low administration of this vaccine,"" said Guido Rasi, former director of the EMA and currently adviser to the Italian government on the COVID-19 emergency.
He said one of the explanations for the low uptake was that J&J's vaccine became available after other shots, when many of the most vulnerable people had already been inoculated, making its use less pressing. 

Ironically, the logistical advantage it offers may also have reduced its use, as authorities sought to deploy it in more remote regions with fewer people.
""Being a single-dose jab, it has been seen as preferable to administer it in places where it would be more problematic to administer the vaccines twice, such as islands and those parts of the country that are more difficult to reach,"" Rasi said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening moderately higher Wednesday, still enjoying the positive tone generated by Fed Chair Jerome Powel’s assurance that the central bank is in no hurry to tighten monetary policy. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded marginally higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%.
The main equity indices closed higher Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining nearly 0.2%, the broad-based S&P 500 rising 0.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperforming, climbing 0.8%, for a new record close.
 ""We will not raise interest rates pre-emptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation... we will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances,” Powell said on Tuesday in his testimony before U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Wall Street had struggled last week, with the Dow suffering its worst week since late October and the S&P 500 since late February, after FOMC members brought forward the likelihood of interest rate hikes to 2023, a year earlier than previously guided.
Powell may have tried to reassure investors, but a great deal of uncertainty over the timing of interest rate hikes and the tapering of asset purchases still exists. Thus comments from FOMC members Michelle Bowman, Eric Rosengren and Raphael Bostic will be studied, as they are all slated to speak at events throughout the day.
Additionally, the release of the June U.S. PMI numbers will attract attention, with the releases set to corroborate other data showing a strongly recovering economy. The equivalent numbers in Europe earlier Wednesday showed Eurozone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years this month.  
The earnings season is largely finished, but Winnebago (NYSE:WGO) is set to report quarterly results before the opening bell, while KB Home (NYSE:KBH) is slated after the close.
Crude oil prices pushed to multi-year highs, after strong demand in the U.S. market drained the country’s inventories. 
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.7% at $73.39 a barrel, a level not seen since September 2018, while Brent was up 0.8% at $75.44, after pushing above $75 a barrel during the previous session for the first time since April 2019.
U.S. inventory numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 7.2 million barrels on Tuesday, continuing a run of large reductions as demand rises in response to a brightening travel season.
Official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due at 10:30 AM ET, with expectations for a fifth straight decline in crude stocks.

The Aegon funds were suspended in March 2020, in line with much of the UK property fund market, due to uncertainty over market valuations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It has proved increasingly challenging to raise sufficient liquidity whilst also ensuring that continuing investors have a representative and well-balanced portfolio,"" the fund manager said in a statement.
""In order to ensure all investors are treated fairly, Aegon AM has decided to take steps to close the funds and return the proceeds to investors as quickly as possible, in a fair and orderly manner.""
The Aegon Property Income fund had 380 million pounds ($530.7 million) in assets under management and the feeder fund's AUM was 150 million pounds, according to Morningstar.
Aegon said in a separate fact sheet it hoped to start distributing around 40% of the money locked up in the funds to investors in the third quarter. It would take between 12 and 24 months to complete the distribution, Aegon added.
Most suspended property funds have reopened after real estate markets stabilised late last year.
But Aviva Investors also closed its UK property funds in May, citing economic uncertainty.
The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed replacing the typical daily redemption notice period for open-ended property funds with notice of up to six months to prevent funds locking up due to a stampede for the exit in times of market crisis.
Such funds are typically owned by retail investors.
""With regulatory changes pending and an uncertain outlook for commercial real estate... times are only going to get tougher for property funds,"" said Oli Creasey, property research analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

Banks have stepped up branch closures after many paused restructuring for much of last year to focus on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Lloyds confirmed the cuts in a statement and said they were in response to fewer customers using the branches, after union Unite criticised the move.
""Like many businesses on the high street, we must change for a future where branches will be used in a different way, and visited less often,"" Vim Maru, retail director for Lloyds, said. 
The latest round of branch closures from Lloyds comes after the lender last November said it had resumed plans to shutter a further 56 outlets, after it temporarily paused closures during the pandemic. 
Union Unite said it had told Lloyds that branches continued to provide an essential service for communities.

""In recent times LBG has spent significant resource to sell its message of 'Helping Britain Recover', Unite national officer Caren Evans said. 
""Unite seriously question how this decision to walk away from local communities promotes this message at a time when the customers will rely on the financial services sector support more than ever.""

(Reuters) -High-end British homebuilder Berkeley Group (OTC:BKGFY) plans to incorporate more green spaces in its developments to cater to rising demand from buyers who prefer to work from home, its CEO said on Wednesday.
UK's housing sector has outperformed the wider real estate segment, thanks to government incentives and rising interest in spacious properties suited to the remote working trend.
""We will make sure that we have enough community spaces so people can leave their flats and have enough open spaces like parks within the community so they can work from there if they like to do so,"" chief Rob Perrins told Reuters on Wednesday.
Berkeley, one of the UK's largest homebuilders by market value, flagged that transaction levels in London have been impacted by pandemic-related restrictions, although it reported a rise of about 3% in annual pre-tax profit at 503.7 million pounds ($703.67 million).
The FTSE 100 firm, which operates mainly in London, Birmingham and the south of England, said transaction levels in the capital city have been hit by the restrictions on travel and deferral of certain sales launches, among other things, and its shares fell 2.4% in morning trade.
However, it added that enquiry levels in London are now ahead of pre-pandemic levels, which signals the return of confidence to the housing market there.
Unlike its bigger rivals, Berkeley mainly focuses on regeneration of brownfield sites by redeveloping land that was previously used for industrial purposes.
The group said it was on track to deliver a 15% pre-tax return on equity, equating to annual pre-tax profits of roughly 500 million pounds till fiscal 2025 end.
UBS analysts said in a note that the rise in the London enquiry levels ""could point towards more robust pricing... and better reservations"".

794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",U.S. Restaurants Boost Menu Prices at Fast Clip to Recoup Costs,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. restaurants, faced with higher food and labor costs, are raising menu prices at a much faster pace than historical rates, insistent on preserving profits after an arduous year.
From local restaurants to national chains like  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG)., owners have boosted prices by as much as 5% in the past few weeks alone. Even at fast-food companies that were locked in price wars just a couple of years ago to win over cost-conscious consumers, increases aren’t taboo anymore.
“We are going to be paying higher prices in restaurants,” said David Henkes, senior principal at industry researcher Technomic. “Part of the calculus right now is there’s probably some appetite of consumers to pay whatever because they haven’t been out for a while.”
Across the nation, prices for food away from home rose 4% in May from a year earlier, the biggest jump since May 2009. It’s one example of a surge in overall inflation that’s left policy makers at the Federal Reserve debating how long the cost pressures will last as the economy bounces back from the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Tampa, Florida, area, restaurateur Andrew Koumi bumped up his menu items by 2% to 4%.
Koumi, founder of a six-location chain called Green Market Cafe, tries to keep food and paper costs below 35% of his menu prices, but lately his computers keep flagging items that go above that parameter. He’s paying twice as much to buy chicken as he was in January, and other meats and paper products have gotten more expensive too.
Koumi isn’t too worried about standing out with his price increases, because “everyone’s doing it. Some people are doing it really drastically,” he said. “Could it go up more? It’s scary. I’m hoping that it levels.”
For now, there’s no sign of abating.
Chipotle recently raised menu prices by as much as 4%, after increasing average pay to $15 an hour and hiring thousands of workers to keep up with demand. American homestyle chain Cracker Barrel (NASDAQ:CBRL) Old Country Store Inc., which earlier this year raised menu prices by 2.8%, is bumping up that increase to about 3% amid continued pressure from wage and commodity expenses, including pork for sausage and bacon.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp., which raised its hourly wage by about 10% in May, hasn’t announced any jump in prices yet but said early this year that franchisees could handle labor inflation “between judicious pricing on the menu as well as just thinking about productivity savings.”
Historically, restaurant operators tend to raise menu prices a few times a year. Between 2015 and 2019, that amounted to increases of about 2.5%, according to BTIG LLC analyst Peter Saleh. This year, the rate may reach about 4%, Saleh wrote in a note to investors.
Although food costs will likely moderate once supply bottlenecks are resolved, higher wages and labor shortages will persist even after pandemic relief has dried out, because people are yearning for greater work-life balance and flexibility in a post-Covid-19 world, Saleh wrote. That will create “inflation that in our view is not transitory,” Saleh said.
Whether higher prices are here to stay or just a temporary blip amid a fast reopening of the economy is at the center of a hot debate in the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Congress hearing Tuesday that price increases recently are larger than expected but reiterated that they will eventually wane.
While commodity prices such as lumber have come down, food costs have continued to surge. U.S. producer prices for processed poultry jumped to an all-time high in May.
Some chains are coming up with creative solutions to avoid raising prices.
Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Inc., for one, is only planning its typical 1% to 2% menu price increase this year. To save costs, the company is now buying whole birds instead of cut-up legs and breasts, selling less-used thigh pieces from a new delivery and takeout brand.
“The big price increases -- the 4% price increases you’re seeing other chains do, that won’t be us,” Chief Executive Officer Charlie Morrison said in an interview. “Large price increases that are promoted and then passed on to the consumer tend to have a negative reaction.”
For smaller businesses, there is often little choice.
In Atlanta, restaurateur Bill Goudey raised prices by as much as 5% on some items a few weeks ago, steeper than the 1% increase he’s more comfortable with. The last few months have been chaotic at his two Copeland’s of New Orleans franchises. Workers have been so scarce that customers have had to wait for a table for up to two hours some weekends.
“While we’re hopeful some of these are short term and supply chain related, many are longer term cost concerns that could take months to resolve,” Goudey said in an email.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son said on Wednesday share buybacks remain an option for the conglomerate, amid a slide in its shares. 
""Buybacks are always on my mind as an important option but when and how big requires balanced thinking,"" Son said at SoftBank's annual shareholders' meeting, adding that the group also needs to consider alternative uses of its capital.
Shares in SoftBank, which completed a record 2.5 trillion yen ($22.6 billion) buyback programme in May, have fallen amid weakness in tech stocks. That has helped widen its conglomerate discount - the gap between the value of its assets and share price - to about 50%.
SoftBank shares closed flat at 7,688 yen on Wednesday. Further falls to 7,000-7,500 yen ""may increase the expectation of a buyback"", Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note earlier this month.
Buybacks would increase 63-year-old Son's own shareholding and make any management buyout easier to achieve. 
""I believe our potential is much bigger than the discounted share price,"" said Son, calling on shareholders to take a long-term view on the company.
The billionaire drew a historical comparison, saying that while credit is given to inventors like 18th century British steam engine pioneer James Watt, the capitalists that funded the railways are overlooked. 
""Just as the Rothschilds were a central player in the industrial revolution, we'd like to become the key player in the information revolution,"" said Son in reference to the prominent European banking dynasty.
He sought to put the focus on SoftBank's role as a ""capital provider for the information revolution"" backing tech startups around the world. The group has hiked its capital commitment in its second Vision Fund to $40 billion, a filing showed on Wednesday. 
However Son faced repeated questions at the meeting about plans for repurchases.

""Aren't you going to do more, are you still not doing it, how much will you buy - being so concerned about only this makes me a little sad,"" Son said.

Investing.com – Score Media (TSX:SCR) shares were up 11% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as single-event sports betting comes closer to being legalized in Canada.
On Tuesday, the country’s Upper Chamber cleared the bill that decriminalizes gambling on single sports games, a status so far enjoyed only by horse racing.
The bill now awaits royal assent to become law, having passed through the House of Commons in February.
The legalization will help state governments collect billions of dollars in taxes, besides creating jobs and helping in innovation, its supporters say.
According to the company, market potential for online gaming in Canada is between $4.3 billion and $5.4 billion in annual gross gaming revenue.
Score’s media app – theScore – is one of the most popular in North America, delivering fans personalized live scores, news, stats, and betting information from their teams, leagues, and players.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Discounts on items ranging from fast food to flights are being offered by Indian firms keen to lure people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, as the economy re-opens gradually from weeks of lockdown.
While businesses in the West make similar offers to dispel vaccine hesitancy, India is badly short of doses for its population of nearly 1.4 billion, and the incentives could serve mainly to attract more customers.
""We feel it is our responsibility to contribute to the national vaccination drive by encouraging more people,"" Sanjay Kumar, a senior official of Interglobe Aviation, which runs India's biggest airline, IndiGo, said in a statement.
Vaccinated customers, even those who have received just one dose, would get a discount of up to 10%, the airline said on Wednesday.
The Indian arm of fast food giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is offering a 20% discount on meals, SoftBank-backed grocer Grofers a month's subscription to its loyalty program, and home appliances maker Godrej extended product warranties.
State-run Central Bank of India Ltd is offering higher interest on deposits from recipients of at least one dose.
To claim the discounts, people must show their vaccination certificates issued by the government. 

India's 291 million administered doses are the most after China and the United States, but only about 5.5% of its estimated adult population of 950 million has received both doses necessary for full protection against the virus.
Vaccine flow is only expected to improve from August.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Middle East shopping mall operator Majid Al Futtaim said on Wednesday retail revenues in the United Arab Emirates in the latter part of 2021 are likely to exceed those seen before the pandemic, as more people are vaccinated and Dubai Expo 2020 begins.
Privately-held Majid Al Futtaim has 28 shopping centres, including in the UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and franchisee rights for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU).
""We are seeing a very solid recovery in the brick and mortar spend on the shopping side,"" Chief Executive Alain Bejjani said, speaking of the company's retail performance in the UAE.
""The amount of spend is growing greater than the footfall growth so the reality is people are being more purposeful of going out to malls and are spending more when going out."" 
In the fourth quarter this year, revenues should exceed the same period in 2019, before the pandemic struck, he said. 
Bejjani, who did not provide figures, said retail revenue earned in the UAE was now close to 2019 levels.
Majid Al Futtaim's UAE shopping centres include the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, which features an indoor ski slope. The company also has hotels and other assets including residential property.

The UAE has one of the fastest vaccination campaigns. Expo 2020, which officials expect will attract 25 million international and domestic visitors, runs from October until March.
Majid Al Futtaim's Mall of Oman, located in the Gulf state's capital Muscat and whose opening had been delayed by the pandemic, was set to open in September, Bejjani said.

In a letter, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee said testimony last week by attorneys from the companies left her with concerns about their dominance of the fast-growing field.
She asked the companies which of their products will support - and which will not - a recently revamped industry alliance known as Matter.

""For what period of time do you commit to support the Matter interoperability project, and who at your companies is responsible for determining whether to extend the length of your commitment to Matter?"" Klobuchar wrote to Amazon and Google.
She called on the companies by July 2 also to answer questions about data collection by voice assistants and how the information is used. 

Last week's hearing followed complaints by Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) Inc and other home-device makers about big tech companies engaging in allegedly anticompetitive tactics to extend their dominance in advertising and other businesses.

(Reuters) -Persimmon Homes and a fund managed by  Aviva  (LON:AV) have agreed to measures called for by Britain's competition regulator as part of an ongoing investigation into possible mis-selling of leasehold homes and high ground rents.
Insurer Aviva will remove ""unfair"" ground rent terms and repay owners whose rents were doubled, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday.
 Persimmon  (LON:PSN) will offer leasehold owners an option to get complete ownership of their property at lower rates.
The regulator launched the investigation in September with cases against top developers Barratt,  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW), Countryside and Persimmon, which is Britain's second largest housebuilder. 
""This settlement with Aviva and Persimmon is a hugely important step,"" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said, adding that new legislation will protect future homeowners. 
The moves come after the CMA in March asked Taylor Wimpey and Countryside to drop unfair ground rent terms. Both said they were cooperating with the regulator.
Persimmon has also agreed to extend the time during which buyers can exchange contracts after reserving a property, and separately said it would cap freehold property prices at 2,000 pounds ($2,796). It stopped selling leasehold homes in 2017.
It added the undertakings formally end the probe into Persimmon, whose shares were down 1.2% to 29.9 pounds at 0754 GMT, while Aviva shares were unchanged. 
Aviva's investment arm said in a statement that one of its funds agreed with the CMA to amend terms for around 1,000 leases it had acquired, adding that these represented only 2% of leaseholds held by Aviva Investors Realm Ground Rent Fund. 
The CMA said it was investigating Brigante Properties, Abacus Land and Adriatic Land, which bought freeholds from either Countryside or Taylor Wimpey and used the same terms.

WeRide, led by founder Tony Han, is pursuing what is known in the auto industry as a level 4 autonomous standard, in which the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.
WeRide, which is testing vehicles in California, its headquarters in China's southern city of Guangzhou and the central city of Zhengzhou, did not disclose details on the size of the funding.
Investors for the $310 million funding round include Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and China Structural Reform Fund, WeRide said in a statement.
Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer of Nissan, said, ""As China stands at the forefront of helping define the future of mobility, we are delighted to partner with WeRide to bring even more innovative technologies and services to enrich people's lives in China.""

Automakers and technology firms are investing billions of dollars in autonomous driving, aiming to take an early lead in what many consider the future of mobility.
In Guangzhou, where several COVID-19 cases were reported in recent weeks, WeRide and several other autonomous driving companies, including Toyota-backed Pony.ai, are delivering essential goods to residents in locked-down communities using self-driving vehicles.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 12:46AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Harvard wasn't pressured over Toshiba, former Japan adviser says","By Ross Kerber and Makiko Yamazaki
BOSTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - A former Japanese government adviser said he did not put pressure on Harvard University's endowment fund to influence its voting at Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's contested shareholder meeting last year, and that the fund should ""set the record straight"".
Hiromichi Mizuno, until recently an adviser to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was identified by a shareholder-commissioned investigation this month as an important figure in what it said was management collusion with METI to block the influence of foreign shareholders.
Mizuno told Reuters he had volunteered to METI officials to speak with Harvard Management Co as he was about to start a fellowship at the university last year.
Mizuno, a member of the board of U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, said he had discussed potential risks for the Harvard fund, known as HMC, over voting at Toshiba. The conglomerate's top shareholder, activist hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management, was pushing for board seats.
HMC was also an investor in Singapore-based Effissimo, sources previously told Reuters.
Mizuno made clear to HMC that he was not representing the Japanese government, he said.
""I have no interest in whichever way you vote,"" Mizuno said he told the endowment's leaders.
Mizuno's comments to Reuters in an interview late on Monday were his first public remarks about Toshiba since the investigation found management colluded with METI to block the influence of Effissimo, HMC and other foreign shareholders, and provided new details about the talks. He had previously told the Financial Times he was not representing the Japanese government.
Mizuno's account also casts new light on events at Toshiba. The incidents detailed in the investigation have renewed concern about Japan's corporate governance and openness to foreign shareholders, and appear to cut against the government's long drive to win more foreign investment.
A spokesperson for HMC declined to comment for this article.
A senior METI official with direct knowledge of the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, backed Mizuno's account and said it was not reflected in the investigation.
Toshiba declined to comment.
The independent investigation found Mizuno's role compromised the vote at the July 2020 annual general meeting after HMC, which held a more than 4% stake, abstained from voting.
It was not clear how HMC had planned to vote at the meeting.
Mizuno told Reuters he tried to keep his dealings with Harvard friendly, and has asked the fund for some clarifications ""to set the record straight"".
Mizuno is the former chief investment officer of Japan's $1.61-trillion pension fund. He resigned as a special adviser to METI after being named a United Nations special envoy, the government said in January.
'HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE'
Some of Mizuno's account stood in contrast with the investigation, which quotes a HMC letter stating the endowment received an unwelcome request from a person -- apparently Mizuno -- before the shareholder meeting and ""found the exchange to be highly inappropriate in both content and timing"".
The report said even if Mizuno spoke as a private citizen, shareholders would understand his government influence.
METI has regulatory power over Toshiba's foreign shareholders because the company is considered a strategic asset, making nuclear and defense equipment.
Mizuno told Reuters in a follow-up message on Tuesday that he served as a channel for messages from HMC to METI and Toshiba after the fund became frustrated with the company, which has been dogged by accounting and governance issues.
Toshiba's shares have recovered after hitting a three-year low last year. The shares are up 68% this year, outperforming an 8% rise in Tokyo's TOPIX index.
Mizuno said the leaders of the $41-billion endowment, Chief Executive N.P. ""Narv"" Narvekar and Chief Investment Officer Rick Slocum, welcomed his input.
HMC did not make Narvekar or Slocum available for an interview.
Effissimo had nominated three candidates to Toshiba's board at the July 31 meeting, all of whom were opposed by management. None were elected although one received 44% of the vote.
Mizuno said he wanted HMC to understand the potential consequences of the vote, given that new rules on foreign ownership in Japan could put scrutiny on HMC's ties to Effissimo.
Sources previously told Reuters that Mizuno voiced the possibility of a regulatory investigation should HMC vote against the interest of Toshiba's management.
Mizuno told Reuters he had wanted to help HMC avoid surprises, and told Narvekar to vote however HMC felt was right to satisfy its fiduciary duty.

""I made it clear I was only trying to give enough information"" for the fund to understand how things worked in Japan, he said.

816,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 10:22PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Reassuring Fed Comments Calm Investor Nerves","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning, with reassuring comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials on inflation and monetary policy starting to calm investors’ frayed nerves.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.16% by 10:11 PM ET (2:11 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan released the minutes from its own monetary policy meeting earlier in the day. The country also released both its manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ index for June earlier in the day, with the former standing at a lower-than-expected 51.5.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.28% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.41%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.78%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.02% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.38%.
The benchmark S&P 500 climbed for a second day as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell insisted that the recent larger-than-expected inflation pressures are transitory.
The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields held declines, while bitcoin rebounded from its fall below the $30,000 mark.
Markets are finally starting to stabilize after the Fed’s sudden hawkish tone in its latest policy decision surprised investors. With the decision hinting at earlier-than-expected asset tapering and interest rate hikes, officials have since sought to reassure continuing Fed support for the economy via asset purchases and low interest rates.
The Fed’s shift during the previous week to acknowledge higher inflation and pull forward its rate hike projections is “a reflection of more positive longer-term dynamics,” BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute analysts led by Jean Boivin said in a report.
“We believe the Fed’s new outlook will not translate into significantly higher policy rates any time soon. This, combined with the powerful restart, underpins our pro-risk stance,” the report added.
In his testimony to the House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on Tuesday, Powell said that recent price increases were bigger than expected but insisted that they will likely wane. He also acknowledged the uncertainty on this view and said the central bank would be patient in increasing borrowing costs.
Ahead of Powell’s testimony, New York Fed President John Williams said that a discussion about raising interest rates is still “way off in the future.” Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said additional employment gains for the next several months are her pre-requisite to assessing whether the U.S. economy has achieved the progress required to begin asset tapering. More Fed officials will also deliver comments throughout the week.
The Fed will also release the results of its bank stress tests on Thursday, with the Bank of England handing down its policy decision earlier in the day.
On the data front, U.S. new home sales for May and the current account balance for the first quarter will be released later in the day."
817,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 08:42PM ET</span>",Explainer: What's happening with Tesla's $7 billion German 'gigafactory'?,"By Nadine Schimroszik and Christoph Steitz
GRUENHEIDE, Germany (Reuters) - Next Thursday, July 1, was supposed to be a day of celebration for Tesla: the opening of its self-styled ""gigafactory"" in the tranquil German municipality of Gruenheide, just outside Berlin.
But thanks to fierce environmental resistance, red tape and planning tweaks it is completely unclear when the first vehicles will roll off the production line of the electric carmaker's first European factory.
Tesla (O:TSLA) has already pushed back the expected opening to late 2021. Yet the environmental agency in Brandenburg, the state where the 5.8 billion euro ($6.9 billion) plant is being built, has still not given final approval - meaning a further delay cannot be ruled out, even into 2022.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? 
It's complicated.
Tesla and its billionaire boss Elon Musk unveiled plans in late 2019 to build the factory.
However the site partly overlaps a drinking water protection zone and borders on a nature reserve, which has drawn heavy opposition from local residents and environmental groups.
Last year, Tesla had to suspend clearing of a forest at the site after environmentalists from local group Nabu highlighted the risk posed to a rare local snake species whose winter slumber could be disturbed by tree-cutting activity.
The snakes had to be rescued before Tesla could proceed but there have been numerous other efforts to stop work at the site on environmental grounds.
""Thousands of hectares of forest will be cleared to create the needed infrastructure and housing space,"" said Manuela Hoyer, who lives about 9 km from the site and is a member of a local campaign opposed to it.
""To build such a plant in a protected drinking water area is actually a crime against the environment.""
Her comments reflects a broader trend in Germany that has also seen renewable projects, such as wind farms, coming under fire from residents that fear the impact on the local habitat.
IS THAT REALLY IT?
No.
Bureaucracy has been a headache for Tesla, too, pitting the company's hands-on approach against Germany's infamous red tape.
So far, Tesla is working based on preliminary construction permits, with large factory halls and structures already built on the 740 acres of land it bought for 43.4 million euros.
But only when Brandenburg's State Environmental Agency provides the final permit can the plant be opened.
While it has previously said that it cannot say when that is every project that has obtained preliminary permits in Brandenburg eventually received the final ok.
But that's not discouraging environmentalists from throwing spanners in the works.
Last week Gruene Liga and Nabu submitted an injunction to a German court against provisional building permits for site, in the latest attempt to ensure Tesla is adhering to environmental laws.
""I think there could be less bureaucracy, that would be better,"" Musk said during his last visit to Gruenheide in May, markedly less enthusiastic than his ""Deutschland rocks"" verdict eight months earlier.
THE BATTERY CELL PLANT
Tesla's construction plans had to be fully resubmitted earlier this month to reflect the addition of battery cell production to the site, costing valuable months.
The Gruenheide plant comprises several units to handle component manufacturing and final vehicle assembly, including a press shop, foundry and body production.
It also includes a water recycling facility, a local fire brigade as well as a depot to ensure more efficient transport of components and other goods. Under the plans, the site's power needs are to be met via local renewable energy sources.
But adding battery cell production meant the company had to tweak and refile the whole application. Based on the most recent version, the plant will have the capacity to produce 500 million cells totalling 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year. 
That's more than the 40 GWh facility rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to set up about 300 kilometres west in Salzgitter near its home base.
DOES ANYONE SUPPORT THE FACTORY (APART FROM ELON)?
Yes.
Tesla's move is seen as a major boost to eastern Germany, which has struggled with high unemployment rates and difficulties to attract large industrial firms.
Once fully up and running, the plant, which Tesla said will be the ""most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"", is expected to create 12,000 jobs and have a capacity of up to 500,000 cars a year.
""We're in favour of a shift towards emission-free mobility and the cars needed to achieve that must be built somewhere,"" said Ralf Schmilewski, a member of the Greens Party in Gruenheide's neighbouring town Erkner.
He said Tesla's plans also address a demographical issue, which has seen younger generations to leave the structurally weak area in their desperate search for jobs.
""Now they have a perspective and don't have to move.""
SO WHAT'S NEXT?
Until mid-July, members of the public can sift through the roughly 11,000 pages of Tesla's application documents, including blueprints, tables and calculations, in the town hall of Gruenheide, the third time they have been put on display.
As part of the process, anyone can file objections until Aug. 16, before the Brandenburg environmental agency decides whether a public discussion should take place on Sept. 13.
When the documents were last made available publicly, in 2020, more than 400 objections were raised.

After that there is no clear timeline. At some point the agency is expected to grant final approval - but when is anyone's guess.

The defensive end said he had agonized https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/raiders-nassib-says-he-is-gay-2021-06-21 about making the announcement for the past 15 years but was immediately greeted with supportive messages from the league, his team, and fellow players, who all praised his courage https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nfl-reactions-raiders-nassib-becoming-first-active-player-come-out-gay-2021-06-22.
Fans responded by making his jersey the top-seller on Monday and Tuesday, according to ESPN, and now corporate America is poised to throw its support behind the trailblazing https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nassib-opens-door-gay-players-many-locker-rooms-still-closed-2021-06-22 figure too. 
Nassib could be recruited to star in ads for outspoken brands such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) or Gillette, which have previously produced commercials that address racial justice and harmful masculine stereotypes, respectively, said Mike Hernandez, director of creative strategy at The Mixx, a New York-based marketing agency that focuses on communicating to LGBTQ audiences. 
""I think brands like Nike and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) are going to realize that by endorsing someone who's identified as LGBTQ, they just stand for someone who's innovative and future thinking. And younger consumers care about that, even if they themselves don't identify as LGBTQ,"" he said.
Nassib's decision to announce that he is gay while he is still an active NFL player ""is probably the biggest LGBTQ story to come out"" for the league, Hernandez added.
""The fact that he's going to be on television every Sunday is pretty impactful,"" he said.
RAINBOW WASHING
Brands that seek to work with Nassib should take care to ensure they are not exploiting the athlete's story, Hernandez said.
""Rainbow-washing is real,"" he said.
Brands should be sensitive and do their homework on what role Nassib or other athletes could add to a marketing campaign, rather than attempt to make a ""cash grab advertising-wise,"" he added.
It helps that Nassib is an established NFL player who signed a three-year contract with the Raiders last year. That increased the likelihood that ""his inclusion (in an ad) will likely be perceived as sincere and not just a matter of tokenism,"" said Charles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova School of Business.
The NFL could also show it values inclusion and tolerance by promoting Nassib, provided the league also comes off as sincere.

""I'd like to think that the NFL would use him as a standard-bearer to promote sexual equality, racial equality, just generally treating people as equals no matter what your preferences are,"" said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. 
""It's a good thing and hopefully the NFL will capitalize positively on it and it won't just be lip service, it will be a serious positive response from them.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of state attorneys general may file a lawsuit against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google as early as next week, accusing the search and advertising giant of violating antitrust law in running its mobile app store, according to three sources familiar with the matter. 
The anticipated lawsuit follows complaints from app developers about Google's management of its Play Store for Android devices, according to one source. The lawsuit has been in the works since last year and has already been delayed, but seems close again, the sources said. 
The investigation by the state attorneys general is being led by Utah, Tennessee, North Carolina and New York. It is unclear how many states will participate. 
Two sources said the case is likely to be filed in federal court in Northern California, where related cases are being heard. These include a lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games Inc filed against Google last year, accusing it of having anticompetitive app store rules. It is expected to go to trial in 2022. 
There also are two proposed class-action lawsuits over the Play store before the same judge. If the states want to participate in depositions and other pre-trial activities, they would have to file fairly soon, one source said.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Epic are awaiting the verdict in a similar California lawsuit after a trial that ended last month. 
A Google spokesperson defended their app store as open. 
""Android is the only major operating system that allows people to download apps from multiple app stores. In fact, most Android devices ship with two or more app stores preinstalled. They can also install additional app stores or apps directly from their browser if they choose,"" the spokesperson said.
Google was originally seen as more open in how it ran its app store than Apple but has tightened rules recently and increased enforcement of those rules.
The lawsuit is expected to focus on Google's requirement that some apps use the company's payment tools to sell subscriptions and content and pay Google as much as 30% of sales, according to two sources. 
App makers like music streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and dating services giant Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which owns the Tinder app, have long accused both Google, as well as Apple, of being anti-competitive in demanding mandatory revenue sharing.

This latest lawsuit is being planned at a time of unusually vigorous debate over whether federal antitrust enforcement is too lax. Many people, including Senator Amy Klobuchar who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, have pressed for tougher enforcement. 
Google already faces a federal lawsuit brought by the Justice Department last year and related antitrust cases brought by two separate groups of attorneys general. One is led by Texas and focused on advertising while the other targets Google's alleged efforts to extend its dominance in search to newer markets, like voice assistants.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 07:38PM ET</span>","India e-commerce rules cast cloud over Amazon, Walmart and local rivals","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -New Indian e-commerce rules will raise costs for all online retailers but particularly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart as they may have to review their business structures, senior industry sources told Reuters. 
India's Ministry of Consumer Affairs outlined plans on Monday which include limiting ""flash sales"" by online retailers, reining in a private label push, compelling them to appoint compliance officers and impose a ""fall-back liability"" if a seller is negligent.
The new rules are expected to have an impact across the board in an e-retail market India forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2026, with players including from Tata's BigBasket, Reliance Industries' JioMart and Softbank-backed Snapdeal to market leaders Amazon and Flipkart.
The rules are the latest in a growing confrontation https://www.reuters.com/world/india/frequent-run-ins-with-india-govt-cloud-us-tech-expansion-plans-2021-06-11 between U.S. tech giants and New Delhi over a host of policy-related issues which are seen by some as protectionist. 
""The rules will have a wider impact on all forms of e-commerce and will increase business costs. Entities, even beyond big players, are analysing the policy and will share concerns with the government,"" Arjun Sinha, a partner at Indian law firm AP & Partners, told Reuters.
The companies have until July 6 to respond to the proposals, after which time they may be reviewed further or implemented.
Snapdeal said it was reviewing the rules. BigBasket declined to comment. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.
One aspect of the proposed new rules which is likely to have a particular impact is one which gives the customer ""suggestions of alternatives to ensure a fair opportunity for domestic goods"" if a retailer is showing imported goods for sale.
""The concept is about promotion of local goods. It's good for Made-in-India products, but not for the platforms,"" said Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis Advocates.
Non-compliance with the rules, if implemented, could be punishable with prison terms, and fines of at least 25,000 Indian rupees under the India's consumer law, Waris added. 
'WIDESPREAD CHEATING' 
Monday's Indian government notification detailing the rules said that they were being issued after complaints of ""widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in the e-commerce ecosystem."" 
It did not name any company. 
The rules potentially present a bigger setback for Flipkart and Amazon, as they contain clauses that say e-commerce firms must ensure none of their related enterprises are listed as sellers on their shopping websites, and that no affiliate entity should sell goods to an online seller operating on its platform.
Amazon holds an indirect stake in two of its top sellers.
Indian retailers allege that Amazon and Flipkart use their wholesale units to indirectly list products on their websites through select sellers, bypassing foreign investment restrictions that prohibit direct sales. 
Both companies deny any wrongdoing. 
Amazon and Flipkart are likely to push back against the proposals, two of the industry sources said.
The rules were seen by some in the industry as a government alternative to a more stringent version of its foreign investment law, which restricts business arrangements Flipkart or Amazon can have with sellers, the sources said. 
""The Consumer Affairs ministry has nothing to do with issues brought under these rules,"" one e-commerce executive said. 
Amazon said in a statement that online marketplaces promote competition and enable transparency, adding that it was reviewing the draft policy and it was too early to comment. 

Flipkart did not respond to a request for comment.
A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation in February cited Amazon documents that showed it gave preferential treatment to a small number of its sellers and used them to bypass federal law, sparking calls for a ban against the company. Amazon has said it does not give favourable treatment to any seller.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden believes steps are needed to safeguard privacy, bolster innovation and deal with other problems created by big technology platforms, the White House said on Tuesday, signaling his support for legislation concerning Big Tech.
Biden is encouraged by bipartisan work underway in Congress to tackle these issues, the official said, a day before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee votes on a package of antitrust bills, some of which target the market power of large tech firms.
""These platforms have transformed our daily lives, and showcase our country's ingenuity and potential, but also create real problems for users, small businesses, and tech startups,"" said the White House official.
""The president believes we need to address the problems these platforms create to protect privacy, generate more innovation, and make sure the great tech companies of the future can emerge and grow right here in the U.S.,"" the official said.
The House Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on a package of six antitrust bills, including two that address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
The legislation drew fire on Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business group, which warned it would have ""dangerous consequences for America.""
It said antitrust laws ""should not be rigged against a small number of companies."" 
The White House hoped the bipartisan proposals would move forward in the legislative process and looked forward to working with Congress on the issue, the official added.

In a separate development, the Federal Trade Commission, whose new chairwoman has been critical of Amazon, has decided to review the company's planned purchase of U.S. movie studio MGM, a source familiar with the matter said.

As consumers shift to digital modes of shopping, companies including Warby, which was last valued at $3 billion after a funding round in 2020, are seeking to attract investors at a time the stock market has seen a record appetite for new listings. 
Warby, known for its fashionable eyewear, was founded in 2010 by four classmates at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, after one of them on a backpacking trip found the cost of replacing eyeglasses was too high.
The company, which sells prescription eyewear starting at $95, also has a brick-and-mortar presence in several markets in the United States and Canada. 
First established as an online brand, Warby has been expanding its real estate footprint since opening its first store in 2013, despite the pandemic having accelerated the shift away from brick-and-mortar outlets.
The company raised $245 million in a funding round last year and is on track to open 35 new stores this year, its co-chief executive officers, Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, told the Wall Street Journal last month. (https://on.wsj.com/3xNLsrH)

Warby, which did not give any indication of the size of its proposed offering, counts Tiger Global Management, General Catalyst, Baillie Gifford and D1 Capital Partners among its backers.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released a sweeping series of memos revealing a clear struggle within the agency ahead of its controversial decision to approve Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm.
The memos reveal disagreements within the agency, with some departments in support of traditional approval and others arguing against.
Ultimately, after months of internal deliberations, agency officials approved the drug using its accelerated approval pathway, which requires a study to confirm the that the drug works as intended.
The June 7 approval has been met with fierce opposition by some scientists criticizing the FDA's decision making, culminating in the public resignations of three of the 11 members of its independent advisory panel. 
One of those members, Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, wrote in his resignation letter that it was the ""worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history.""
The drug was approved in spite of the fact that one of its two large-scale clinical trials failed to show a benefit to patients.
The FDA's Office of Biostatistics in particular concluded that ""substantial evidence of effectiveness had not been provided in the application,"" citing ""inconsistencies in the data"" that led the group to not support approval. That full document has not been released.
In an interview with Reuters, FDA officials said they considered the advisory panel's recommendation against approval as a ""reset point"" in their thinking, prompting them to consider the accelerated approval pathway after concluding that the drug had not met the high standard for regular approval. 
""What we heard really shaped our thinking in our discussions over these almost seven months between the advisory committee and the approval,"" said Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Instead of direct evidence of a clinical benefit from the trials, the FDA's accelerated approval pathway relies on the use of a biomarker - a biological change prompted by the drug - that could likely predict a patient benefit. 
Dr. Peter Stein, director of FDA's Office of New Drugs, agreed that the medicine had not met the standard for full approval, but said it did meet FDA's standard for accelerated approval, which is typically used for drugs for diseases with no other effective treatments.
Stein said Biogen's data showed a relationship between removing the protein beta amyloid from patients' brains, believed to be contributor to Alzheimer's disease, and improvements seen in its clinical trials.
Cavazzoni said the agency's review of the data showed that amyloid reduction tracks ""quite convincingly"" with improvements in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's.
The early release of some of its decision memos - which usually follow a month to six weeks after an agency approval - was part of an effort to disclose the FDA's decisionmaking process, she said. 
""We were really quite struck that the data were compelling, and it behooved us to continue to really discuss and review these data and understand it to the fullest,"" Cavazzoni said.
'STILL BEING WORKED OUT' 
Experts, however, have argued that several drugs in prior Alzheimer's trials have removed amyloid but failed to impact disease progression.
Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the University of Southern California's Alzheimer's Therapy Research Institute in San Diego, and a paid adviser to Biogen, said he believes Aduhelm benefits patients, but disagrees that removing amyloid has been shown to correlate with patient benefits.
""One of the risks is it suggests that any drug that lowers amyloid in any population with Alzheimer's disease is justified,"" Aisen said after reviewing the FDA documents. ""We have not established that.""
Dr. Jason Karlawish, co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia who ran one of the trial sites for the Biogen drug, said the documents reveal clear disagreement. 
""The science around this particular relationship between amyloid and clinical response is still being worked out,"" he said. The agency should have reconvened its advisory board to weigh in on the matter, he said.
Some six million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer's disease, although Aduhelm is likely to be used only on those in its early stages - the type of patients who took part in Biogen's trials. 
Biogen has stated publicly that it could take nine years to complete a study confirming whether removing amyloid really slows the ravages of the fatal mind-wasting disease. 

Stein said the agency is already in talks with the company about designing that trial. 
""I'm very hopeful that the answer will come years before that nine-year period,"" he said.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 05:46PM ET</span>","U.S. Fed bank stress tests pave way for stock buyback, dividend bonanza","By David Henry and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The country's largest lenders are poised to start issuing as much as $130 billion in dividends and stock buybacks from next month after the U.S. Federal Reserve gives them what is expected to be a clean bill of health on Thursday, said analysts.
The Fed on Thursday will release the results of its ""stress tests,"" an annual health check introduced in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis to see how banks would fare in an extreme hypothetical economic downturn.
Due to pandemic lockdowns, lenders last year weathered a real-life economic crash that was by many measures more extreme than the Fed's imaginary scenario. The downturn prompted the regulator to issue emergency regulatory relief, curb bank capital distributions, and conduct two additional stress tests in 2020.
Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect the country's largest lenders to perform well on Thursday, leading the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs.
""The banks entered the crisis well-capitalized, played an important role in the economic response, and now appear set to reward their shareholders with meaningful capital returns,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading.
LIFTING CURBS
The Fed imposed additional limits on bank capital distributions in June 2020 after a COVID-19 ""sensitivity analysis"" showed overall loan losses at 34 large banks could reach $700 billion, with some lenders falling below minimum required capital levels.
After banks performed well during another stress test in December, the Fed allowed them to resume buying back stock in addition to paying dividends capped at the bank's annual net income.
In March, the central bank said that it expected to lift remaining curbs for “most firms” after its stress tests in June provided banks were above regulatory minimum capital levels.
Broadly speaking, this year's test is more severe than the 2020 scenario the Fed devised prior to the pandemic, which envisioned unemployment peaking at 10%, but is less severe than December's test which put that figure at 12.5%. For 2021, the hypothetical unemployment rate peaks at 10.75%. 
The KBW Bank Index is up about 25% this year compared with a 13% gain in the S&P 500 index, driven in part by expectations banks will pass easily.
""This is one of the positive catalysts that bank investors are looking for this year,"" said David Long, a Raymond James analyst. 
The Fed rules allow lenders to adjust their buybacks and dividends quarterly. Since April, big lenders have issued more than $40 billion in debt to help finance what some analysts expect to be record payouts. 
""The numbers are big,"" wrote Glenn Schorr, an Evercore ISI analyst. By his estimates the six biggest banks will spend, on average, 122% of earnings on buybacks and dividends in the 12 months beginning July, more than double the ratio of the previous period.
Those six - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co together will increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion in the next four quarters, according to Schorr's estimates.
The banks and the Fed declined to comment.
WELLS WINNER?
Wells Fargo, which has built up capital more rapidly than rivals due in part to a Fed-imposed cap on its balance sheet, is expected to post the biggest jump in payouts - spending an additional $19 billion over the next 12 months by Schorr's estimates.
    All told, the country's fourth-largest lender could pay out 167% of earnings compared with just 28% during the previous 12 months, according to Schorr's estimates.

While the bumper paydays will please shareholders, they are likely to draw ire from Democrats in Washington, who want banks to use their cash to help everyday Americans.
""Pressure going forward will be on how to make the ... test tougher,"" wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group.

(Reuters) - Shares of software firm Alfi Inc finished up 108.8% on Tuesday, one of the latest companies that has seen its stock surge in a broader rally that has refocused attention on so-called meme stocks in recent weeks.
Shares in Alfi closed at $16.29 after touching a high of $16.45, with 211 million shares changing hands, making it the third most actively traded stock on U.S. exchanges on the day. Its market cap has ballooned to $201 million, from a $15.5 million valuation for its early May stock market debut.
Some social media users and one portfolio manager cited a Benzinga.com report that Alfi planned to buy back stock as helping to fuel the rally. An investor relations representative for Alfi pointed Reuters to the report without providing details.
The stock had already surged almost 127% last week after it announced the rollout of tablets to Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers nationwide.
""They've had two great stories come out in recent days. It's a small company and doesn't take much to move the stock,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.
Volatility in stocks including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) have in recent weeks helped reinvigorate a meme stock craze that reached a peak in January, fueled in-part by retail investors congregating on platforms such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
""I call this the casino corner of the stock market, all those highly speculative retail stocks that are being traded with no attention to what their actual worth is or fundamentals,"" said Ernesto Ramos, U.S. chief investment officer at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago.
Other stocks that have recently captured investor attention include Torchlight Energy Resources (NASDAQ:TRCH), which was the second most actively traded stock on Tuesday, falling 29.4% after it increased its stock offering to $250 million from $100 million as it cashed in on retail investor interest in its shares. It had closed Monday's session up 58%.
Shares of GameStop, meanwhile, closed up just under 10% after announcing it raised about $1.13 billion in its latest share offering, cashing in further on interest in its shares. 

Shares of AMC, which closed up 4.6% on Tuesday are up 2888% for the year-to-date, while GameStop's were still up about 1070% for the year so far even after paring gains dramatically. 
Clover Health closed up 12.4% on Tuesday after rising as much as 25% earlier in the session.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street rebounded Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed not to raise rates too quickly as the dollar and oil gave up earlier gains.
Led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, Wall Street closed Tuesday higher, bouncing back from a sell-off set off last week by a Fed policy update that suggested officials believed rates would rise more quickly to counter rising inflation.
The Nasdaq closed at another record high, as top-shelf tech companies resumed their growth trajectories.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.61 points, or 0.2% and the S&P 500 gained 21.65 points, or 0.51%. to 4,246.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.79 points, or 0.79 percent, to 14,253.27.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 4.4 points or 0.62%.
""I really think there's a realization that this is a ripe environment: rates are still low and for stock investors, this hits a 'just right' tone,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. ""The market is concerned about rising inflation numbers and was getting more unnerved as the Fed dismissed them until last week’s meeting.""
Testifying before Congress, Powell vowed that the Fed will not raise rates out of fear of potential rising inflation, and instead will prioritize a ""broad and inclusive"" recovery of the job market. He said recent price increases do not suggest higher rates are needed, and instead can be attributed to categories directly impacted by economic reopening.
""After the FOMC took the wind out of the reflation trade at the end of last week, that’s started to reverse over the last two days. It seems last week’s price action went too far,"" said Stephanie Roth, senior markets economist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. 
Powell's remarks pushed yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries lower, dipping to yield 1.4649% after clearing 1.5% earlier in the day.
The dollar also dipped as Powell spoke, with the dollar index falling 0.20% to 91.733. It is holding below a two-month high of 92.408 reached on Friday.
Oil slid slightly after Brent rose above $75 a barrel for the first time in over two years, as OPEC+ discussed raising oil production.
Brent crude futures settled down 9 cents to $74.81 a barrel after hitting a session high of $75.30 a barrel, the strongest since April 25, 2019.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 60 cents, or 0.8%, to $73.06 a barrel.

Bitcoin began making a comeback of sorts, climbing back above $30,000 after hitting lows not seen since January. The cryptocurrency last traded at $32,831, but has nearly halved in value over the last three months. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies came in for heavy selling on Monday, hurt by a tightening crackdown on trading and mining in China.
Spot gold prices fell $4.8691 or 0.27%, to $1,778.08 an ounce.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 05:29PM ET</span>","U.S. fast-food chains cut discounts, push pricy meals post-pandemic","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Restaurant chains including McDonald's Corp and KFC are paring back $5-and-under ""value"" items in favor of more expensive $10-to-$30 combination meals, a strategy employed to lift sales and profits and offset rising food costs as the U.S. economy reopens. 
""Value"" meals – sandwich, soda and French fry combinations priced at $5 or less — have long been a staple of fast-food offerings. Chains used the deals to lure bargain-conscious customers, bringing traffic to stores. But deals priced at $5 and under have become less generous in the last 18 months.
During the pandemic, fast-food gained market share from other restaurants forced to close as customers motored through socially distant drive-throughs to pick up a sack of burgers. Now that the United States is reopening, those chains are selling new, pricier sandwiches and meals to customers - a move that some warn may alienate some hourly workers and other lower-income customers as government subsidies wane and mom-and-pop restaurants reopen. 
So far, the chains' trade-up tactic is working, helping lift comparable sales at limited-service restaurants by 11.5% this May compared to the same month in 2019, according to data from Black Box Intelligence. Profit margins are also up at several major chains.
""Value menu items are not really profit drivers. They're designed to drive traffic,"" said BTIG analyst Peter Saleh.
The pandemic also forced chains to halt development of new items. As U.S. COVID-19 cases fall, chains are again launching new sandwiches – and promoting them – to try to boost traffic, he said.
Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co said it pioneered the value menu in 1989, when it dedicated part of its menu board to 99-cent items. But today, Wendy's is ""trading folks up into our best, highest-quality food items,"" said Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor during a May earnings call with analysts, ""and we'll continue to do that.""
Wendy's current menu includes items that are higher priced than its standard burgers, like its Spicy Pretzel Bacon Pub – a fried chicken fillet on a pretzel bun topped with pickles, fried onions, bacon, two kinds of sauce and muenster cheese for $7. 
KFC, owned by Yum Brands International said it stopped marketing ""$5 Fill Ups"" – a pot pie or chicken dish, plus a medium drink, chocolate chip cookie and sometimes a biscuit – aimed at individuals in 2020. It now promotes family meal deals that cost as much as $30.
Dominos Pizza Inc said in April it did not need its ""Boost Week"" discount to drive store traffic. So it suspended the half-price pizza promotion for online orders.
Franchisees typically try to maximize profits, said Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman. When commodity costs are as high as they have been over the past year, franchisees discount less to maintain profitability. Many chains increased their U.S. margins during the pandemic, including McDonald's and Yum Brand's Taco Bell, she said.
U.S. Producer Prices Index data for May showed prices businesses have paid for meat and poultry have spiked more than 20 percent since the start of the year.
CORE CUSTOMERS
Fast-food customers include both wealthier and lower-income hourly workers. 
People with household incomes of $100,000 or more made up about 39% of fast-food visits in May, while people making less $25,000 comprised about 12% of visits, according to data from The NPD Group.
Those with incomes between $25,000 and $100,000 made up 49% of visits, the data show.
Chains and franchisees that remove too many low-priced deals risk losing core customers who specifically come in for those items, said Mark Kuperman, chief operating officer at Revenue Management Solutions, a Florida-based pricing advisor to restaurants. 
To be sure, chains haven't completely abandoned the value menu. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) launched its ""$1 $2 $3 Dollar"" menu during the fast-food discount wars of 2018 as part of its turnaround plan. Today, that menu is pared down to 8 items instead of 12.
The company said value items remain a core part of its marketing. Meanwhile, it is aggressively promoting its $10 ""BTS Meal"" named for the popular South Korean boy band that endorses it. That higher-priced promotion is part of a strategy to reach younger customers, McDonald's said.
Data shows fast-food chains launched fewer new combination meals over the last 18 months, according to Datassential, a Chicago research firm that counts the deals that U.S. national restaurant chains promote on their websites and social media.
A sample of 51 U.S. quick-service chains launched a total of 38 ""combo/value meals"" through May. That's roughly on par with 66 total value meals that chains launched in 2020. But the 2020 figure was nearly 57% lower than the 152 value meals the chains launched in 2018.

Restaurant operators are optimistic.
""I've never seen consumers less price sensitive than they are today,"" one fast-food franchisee told Reuters.

Representatives from 500 unions, which together account for 1.4 million workers in the United States, have come together at the 30th international convention of Teamsters to support and help improve the livelihoods of Amazon workers. 
The union tweeted that delegates will vote on a resolution to make the campaign at Amazon a 'top priority'. 
It is also planning pressure campaigns involving work stoppages, petitions and other collective action to push Amazon to bargain over working conditions and meet workers' demands.
Amazon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

The e-commerce giant and one of the largest private employers in America has for decades discouraged attempts among its over 800,000 U.S. employees to organize, showing managers how to identify union activity, raising wages and warning that union dues would cut into pay.
In April, Amazon Alabama workers voted against forming a union, owing to factors including the company's fierce resistance to unionization, workers' skepticism that organizing would get them a better deal and decisions on election parameters. (https://reut.rs/3d3UxV7)

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Investors calling for  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) to study the impact of getting its oil and gas business to net-zero emissions by 2050 will push for talks later this year with what they hope is a more sympathetic board.
Exxon shareholders voted 49.4% in favor of the study, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. Companies typically respond to proposals that get majority support from investors.
""We were validated,"" said John Geissinger, chief investment officer at Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS), which wants Exxon to quantify the financial impact of a net-zero strategy. ""A significant number of shareholders believe that assessing the risks to the company under different climate scenarios is critically important."" 
Geissinger expects to hold talks with Exxon this fall on the proposal, and hopes to collaborate on the outlines of the report. 
The CBIS proposal won support of big investors BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, which combined hold more than 12% of Exxon shares. 
""We want to have some transparency to the risks that the company faces,"" Geissinger said. The requested report would examine the impact on Exxon of a world moving to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Exxon recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, citing the range of scenarios within its planning. But a quarter of its board lost their seats to nominees of a hedge fund prodding Exxon to cut spending on fossil fuels and address a world moving to lower-carbon fuels. 

""We value the input and feedback we receive from our investors, and we will continue to engage with our shareholders as we move forward,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. 
Exxon has pledged to limit the pace of growth of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but has not agreed to net zero emissions by 2050 as rivals BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and TotalEnergies have done.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Oshkosh Defense said Tuesday it will build next-generation U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivery vehicles in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and expects to hire over 1,000 employees to do so.
The USPS awarded a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh Corp, in February. The contract could be worth more than $6 billion in total.
It allows for the delivery over 10 years of between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles, with a mix of internal combustion-powered and battery-electric models.
The company is making a $155 million investment in South Carolina. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it will provide engines, transmissions and other parts for the new delivery vehicles. The second largest U.S. automaker will provide parts for both the electric battery and internal combustion engine versions, including suspensions and other components, Ford said, declining to release financial terms.
Last week, electric vehicle company Workhorse Group filed a legal challenge to the decision after the USPS rejected its bid.
Workhorse had proposed building an all-electric vehicle fleet for the USPS, and has the support of many U.S. lawmakers.
Oshkosh Defense plans to repurpose a warehouse to fulfill the contract, and production is expected to begin in mid-2023.
USPS said last week ""preproduction design, tooling and facility preparation are proceeding on schedule, with the first (next-generation delivery vehicles) estimated to appear on carrier routes in 2023.""
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has committed to at least 10% of the fleet being electric, but he said in a letter in March to lawmakers that with government assistance the USPS could commit to making a majority of the fleet electric within 10 years. 
He added that the USPS needs about $8 billion to electrify the new fleet to the ""maximum extent"" feasible.
President Joe Biden and some lawmakers in Congress have called for government funding to speed the USPS's transition to more electric vehicles.
New USPS vehicles will include air conditioning and heating, improved ergonomics, and advanced vehicle safety technology including air bags and 360-degree cameras.

Most current delivery vehicles are at least 25 years old and do not have air conditioning or modern safety features.
A 2020 report said the USPS spent $706.2 million in maintenance costs for 141,057 delivery vehicles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he intends to nominate a senior union lawyer to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board as Democrats move to retake control.
Biden plans to tap David Prouty, general counsel of Service Employee International Union (SEIU) Local 32BJ, the largest labor union for property service workers in the country with over 175,000 members, to fill the seat currently held by Republican William Emanuel, the White House said. Emanuel's term is set to expire Aug. 27.
Biden last month nominated veteran union lawyer Gwynne Wilcox for a vacant seat on the NLRB. If both are confirmed, Democrats would take control of the five-member labor board.
Prouty declined to comment. Reuters first reported Prouty's nomination.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday praised Biden in a tweet for ""for acting quickly to return a pro-worker majority to the @NLRB.""
Once Democrats have a majority on the board, they are expected to move quickly to undo a slew of Trump-era precedents seen as favoring businesses over unions.
Biden backs legal changes to make it easier for workers to organize and join unions. On Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris said the Biden administration ""will probably be the most pro-union of any we've seen before.""
Those include major Trump-era rulings that made it easier for employers to defend workplace rules; barring union organizers and off-duty employees from engaging in organizing activities on employers’ property; giving businesses more power to make unilateral changes to working conditions and prohibiting workers from using company email for union organizing.
The board is also expected to scrap and replace Trump-era rules involving ""joint employment,"" where businesses are considered the employers of contract or franchise workers, and the procedures for holding union elections and litigating post-election challenges.
Under then-President Barack Obama, the board adopted rules that sped up the election process, which is typically seen as favoring unions; in 2019, the board reversed course and slowed the process down again. A federal judge threw out some of the 2019 rules.

Prouty served as a senior lawyer for the Major League Baseball Players Association from 2008 through 2017 and previously was general counsel of UNITE HERE, the union formed by the 2004 merger of two major unions. 
In January, Biden fired the NLRB's general counsel and removed the deputy general counsel from her position.

Want to learn more? Then read on.Favorable policy measures and rising investor optimism in the electric vehicle (EV) industry worldwide have lured a large number of new entrants into the sector over the past year. There was a 39% year-over-year rise in global EV sales in 2020. In China, 1.3 million EVs were sold, representing 8% year-over-year growth. China’s economic growth and favorable policy measures to boost its EV industry, along with the advantage of the nation’s own supply of raw minerals used for making EV batteries, should help several Chinese companies achieve solid growth.
Although a global semiconductor chip shortage has been disrupting EV production worldwide, China has been doing a decent job keeping its production going. In fact, many Chinese companies have raised their second quarter delivery forecasts. This, combined with China’s focus on developing its technology sector and domestic production in its five-year plan to combat competition from Western countries, should position China to lead the global EV market in the future.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at a record highs Tuesday with big tech making strong gains as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in testimony before Congress continued to downplay fears over the sharp pace of inflation. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.51%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.20%, or 68 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.79% at 14,223.27.
Powell largely stuck to his prepared remarks in testimony before a House select subcommittee hearing on the Fed’s pandemic response and the economy, reiterating the rapid pace of inflation will fade and job gains will pick up in the coming months.
“[P]erhaps all of the overshoot in inflation comes from categories such as rising used car and trucks, airplane tickets, hotel prices that have been affected by the reopening of the economy,"" Powell said in response to questioning from lawmakers on whether inflation is transitory. These factors ""will ultimately start to decline.""
“[W]hile these effects have turned out to be larger than we expected, the incoming data are consistent with the view that these factors will wane over time,” he added.
Ahead of the speech, differing remarks from several Fed members – who lean dovish or hawkish – on how soon to rein in easy monetary policy measures have raised concerns over a possible growing divide among Fed members.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan signaled that tapering could come sooner rather than later. Meanwhile New York Fed President John Williams called for support to remain in place as the economy is still a ways off from achieving the Fed's goals.
Technology stocks benefited from the weakness in bond yields, with the United States 10-Year remaining below 1.5%.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher.
Alphabet pared intraday losses that followed reports that the EU launched a formal antitrust investigation into the company's core digital ad business. 
As well as falling yields, the broader tech sector was helped by a boost from semiconductor stocks, led by Nvidia.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) ended up more than 2% higher after the chipmaker made further efforts to deter cryptocurrency miners from purchasing its chips to avoid the boom and bust demand cycle seen a few years ago when a sharp turn lower in cryptocurrency mining activity resulted in a chip supply overhang.
Some on Wall Street sees further gains for tech ahead, with quarterly results on the horizon.
""Overall we remain very bullish on tech stocks for 2H as robust June results and guidance around the corner will be another positive catalyst for the tech sector in our opinion,"" Wedbush said.
In cryptocurrency news, Bitcoin briefly fell below the $30,000 for the first since January, but bounced back as the popular crypto continues to search for meaningful support following its slump from $60,000 earlier this year."

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc is expanding its ""Shops"" feature to its messaging app WhatsApp in several countries and to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Marketplace in the United States, the company said on Tuesday as it announced changes to its commerce tools.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said it would also introduce personalized ads in its Shops service based on users' shopping behavior.
The social media giant, which launched Shops last year as a way for people to find and buy products on Facebook and Instagram as part of its push into ecommerce, said it has more than 300 million monthly Shops visitors and about 1.2 million monthly active Shops.
Zuckerberg said during Facebook's last earnings release that e-commerce is one of the company's three key areas of focus, along with working on augmented and virtual reality and helping content creators earn money on Facebook's platforms.
The company said it would in the coming months test an artificial intelligence tool called 'visual search' so users shopping on its photo-sharing site Instagram can click on items and find similar products in Shops. 

Users will be able to use this search from content on the app or on photos on their own camera rolls, Zuckerberg said. 
Facebook is also working on ways using augmented reality that shoppers can try on items, including from ads, Zuckerberg said, speaking in a live audio room on Facebook.

Investing.com -- Stocks greeted Jerome Powell's congressional testimony warmly, breaking higher after the Federal Reserve Chair reiterated his belief that the current inflation pressures will ease as the recovery continues.
Powell said he had a ""level of confidence"" that prices will eventually come down and noted that a 5% inflation environment wouldn't be acceptable. He urged patience. Powell's comments came on the heels of others from the Fed's John Williams and Loretta Mester on what was a day of heavy Fedspeak.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). hit a $2 trillion valuation for the first time, riding the wave of stocks higher after Powell's comments.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was in the spotlight after the EU launched a formal antitrust investigation into the company's core digital ad business.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose after the chipmaker made further efforts to deter cryptocurrency miners from purchasing its chips to avoid the boom and bust demand cycle seen a few years ago when a sharp turn lower in cryptocurrency mining activity resulted in a chip supply overhang.
Bitcoin had a heck of a day, falling below the $30,000 for the first time since January, but later rebounding back above that mark.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More Fed speak
After Jerome Powell's relatively uneventful congressional testimony today, regional governors continue the conversation on Wednesday. Michelle Bowman, Raphael Bostic and Eric Rosengren are all slated to speak at events throughout the day.
2. New home sales
While sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth straight month, new home sales for May should show a gain from April's 863,000. Consensus is calling for a 1.4% increase, and a total of 875,000 when the number hits at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
3. Crypto crazy
Keep an eye on everybody's favorite volatile cryptocurrency. Bitcoin dropped below $30,000 earlier today for the first time since January, giving back its gains for the year and erasing more than half of its value since April's high of almost $65,000. Ongoing concerns about China cracking down on cryptos was blamed for the latest dip.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 03:39PM ET</span>",Egypt eyes surge in fintech investment after new laws,"By Patrick Werr
CAIRO (Reuters) - New legislation and regulatory changes in Egypt are set to unleash a surge in new fintech investments and change the way the country's largely unbanked citizens do business, industry players say. 
Fintech innovation in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, has trailed other emerging market powerhouses such as China, India, Kenya and Indonesia, a situation the industry hopes the new legal environment will change. 
One innovator is MNT NV, a microfinance lending and payments company with more than a million active customers and a 21.7% market share. It has just completed a share swap to take over fintech company Halan Inc, Mounir Nakhla, a cofounder of both firms, told Reuters. The deal had not previously been reported. 
MNT-Halan is Egypt's first private non-bank company to be licensed by the central bank to operate a digital wallet, a mobile telephone application that allows consumers, vendors, lenders and borrowers to transfer money, pay bills, buy goods on instalment, secure loans and make other transactions. 
MNT is marrying its large base of unbanked users with electronic technology, hoping to place itself at the forefront of a digital transformation. 
""What we're going to do will be revolutionary, I believe. We have the reach, the technology and the capacity to scale,"" said Nakhla, who created the first of a series of start-ups in 2010. MNT has attracted $50 million from venture capital funds and other investors, and hopes to raise more capital soon. 
MNT will also leverage more than a hundred warehouses and distribution points it has around Egypt and a fleet of vehicles to deliver products ordered online the same day. 
Private investors have been reluctant to put money in Egypt in recent years due to an expansion of state ownership in the economy, and it remains to be seen how keen fintech investors will be. 
NEW LAWS
But changes in the legal and regulatory framework could encourage them.
In September, the government passed a new law governing the central bank with provisions allowing it to give out banking licences to fintech firms, said Mohamed Essam, a fintech specialist at the law office of Matouk, Bassiouny and Hennawy.
A second law for the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) and governing non-banking fintech such as nano-finance, consumer tech and insurance tech is in parliament and due to be finalised in the coming months.
""Suddenly in two years we have the new central bank law, regulations for wallets,"" and soon the FRA law, Essam said. 
""We believe that within the next few months or couple of years we will see a big bang in fintech."" 
UNICORNS
Ahmed Alfi, chairman of venture capital firm Sawari Ventures, says MNT could be Egypt's second fintech ""unicorn"", or company with a market value exceeding $1 billion, after e-payments giant Fawry, now worth about $2 billion. 
""There will be several unicorns in the fintech space in Egypt,"" said Alfi. Sawari Ventures runs a 1 billion Egyptian pound ($64 million) fund that invests in high-growth companies. 
Sawari has not invested in MNT-Halan, but has taken a share in another start-up, MoneyFellows. 
MoneyFellows has been digitising a traditional system where friends and acquaintances regularly pay into a fund and distribute the proceeds in turns to help members make big purchases, a system known in Egyptian Arabic as a ""gamiya"". 
Established in Egypt in 2018, MoneyFellows now has 1.5 million users and has raised capital of $11 million. 
It tentatively plans to raise $20 million or more from venture capital funds this year to expand into new products and countries. 
""We're looking at other markets, such as Africa,"" said founder and CEO Ahmed Wadi. ""We're also planning add-ons"", such as offering buy now, pay later options with certain merchants.
OPPORTUNITIES 
Ashraf Sabry, chairman of Fawry, said a new e-money law, passed a year ago, that requires bigger companies to accept and disburse money electronically, was also a big step. 
The law will come into force in September, he said. 
Egypt, with a population of 102 million and a workforce of about 28 million, has around 19 million debit cards, a similar amount of prepaid cards and about four million credit cards issued, Sabry said. They are often used only for withdrawing cash, but with 25-30 million people owning smartphones the country is primed for electronic banking to take off, he added.

Fawry over the last two months raised 400 million Egyptian pounds in a capital increase.

Known for its iconic glazed donuts, the company plans to sell about 26.7 million shares priced between $21 and $24 per share, the filing showed. At the upper end of the price range, it would raise about $640 million.
Krispy Kreme's listing plans come at a time when the U.S. IPO market is witnessing unprecedented levels of activity, with companies having already raised around $171 billion, according to data from Dealogic, scorching past last year's record of $168 billion. 
The donut seller had confidentially filed with regulators in early May, which revealed a surge in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, driven by rising demand for sugary snacks during the pandemic. 
Krispy Kreme opened its first store in North Carolina in 1937 when it started selling doughnuts in local grocery stores. It first went public in 2000 but its unit had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005.
It sold 1.3 billion donuts across 30 countries in fiscal 2020, capping the highest level of sales in the brand's history, with net revenues of $1.1 billion. 

The IPO would mark Krispy Kreme's return to U.S. stock markets five years after it was taken private by JAB Holding Co in a $1.35 billion deal in 2016. 
J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the lead book-running managers for the offering. It intends to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""DNUT"".

The Fed has consistently spoken of inflation being transitory over the past couple of months, which has resulted in investors becoming less concerned over higher prices. But it appeared that the Fed reversed course as it is now, indicating it would raise rates ahead of schedule. This created more volatility in the markets leading to a tough day on Friday. But, if you look closer at their remarks, not everything is as it seems. I will expand on my point below. But first, let's recap the past week in the markets. Read on below….Stocks finished lower last Tuesday after investors digested a slew of economic data ahead of Wednesday's Fed decision. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell from their record closing levels. Retail sales fell more than expected in May, as consumers spent less on big-ticket items such as cars, and producer price index data came in higher than expected, which stoked inflation fears.
The market closed down on Wednesday after the Fed signaled it expects to increase the benchmark lending rate ahead of schedule. Though the Fed kept interest rates and asset purchases the same for the time being. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that support would stay in place in his post-meeting press conference.
On Thursday, stocks continued a rotation into growth-oriented names as investors didn't seem too bothered by the unexpected shift from the Federal Reserve. Initial jobless claims rose to 412,000, higher than the expected 359,000 and last week's 375,000. This rise isn't too concerning, though, as initial claims are expected to continue to decline over the medium term.

So, it could be wise to avoid shares of cryptocurrency related companies Coinbase (COIN), Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), Marathon (MARA), and Bit Digital (BTBT). We think they are at risk of losing more value in the coming months. Read on.While the world witnessed a cryptocurrency boom earlier this year—with the most popular digital currency bitcoin hitting its $64,863.10 all-time high on April 14—China’s intensifying crackdown led to a major decline in the cryptocurrency market. While bitcoin has so far lost more than half its value since its April high, other cryptocurrencies retreated significantly also.
Crypto investors' sentiment has been further dampened by the Fed’s hawkish pivot. The Fed said last week that it expects inflation to rise 3.4% this year and sees two interest rate hikes in 2023, which is earlier than was expected. Since this reflects the central bank’s rising concerns over inflation, risky assets like cryptocurrencies will likely continue to face significant pressure.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to avoid cryptocurrency related stocks such as Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN), Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT), Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA), and Bit Digital, Inc. (BTBT). They look significantly overvalued now and are expected to continue declining in the near term.

Thus, both Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and eBay (EBAY) are expected to continue benefiting from the industry tailwinds given their dominant market positions. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out. Shopify Inc . (SHOP) and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) are two established players in the e-commerce space. SHOP provides a cloud-based, multichannel commerce platform designed for small- and medium-sized businesses. EBAY operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. Its multi-screen approach offers downloadable applications for the iPhone operating system and android mobile devices that allow access to some of its websites and vertical shopping experiences.
The e-commerce industry took off last year as people’s dependency on e-commerce services increased with their need to spend most of their time at home. While economies are reopening this year with solid progress on the vaccination front, the online commerce trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future due to its convenience and the increasing adoption of the internet and smartphones. According to Globe Newswire, the global e-commerce market is expected to grow at a 22.9% CAGR between 2020 - 2027. Consequently, both SHOP and EBAY should benefit.

Pilots undertaking flights to these countries need to be fully vaccinated from Aug. 1 and the same rule will apply to flight attendants from July 31.

Last month, the Chicago, Illinois-based airline had reached a deal with its pilots' union that does not make vaccine mandatory, but provides extra pay to those who receive it. 

The agreement also restricted unvaccinated pilots from working on trips to places that require vaccinations.
Airlines in the United States are seeing an increase in travel demand as the rate of vaccination picks up pace and countries ease border restrictions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Businesses worldwide are fighting sophisticated data scientists as they battle to protect their data-rich computers from cyber crime - and the costly attacks are not going to stop, a top expert at insurer Sompo Holdings Inc said on Tuesday.
""It's like the Terminator: They're just going to keep coming at you"" because it is profitable, Brad Gow, global cyber product leader at Sompo International, said on a panel at the Reuters Future of Insurance USA conference, referring to the dystopian movies.
Criminals are ""extracting hundreds of millions from Western insurance companies and other Western companies,"" he said. ""I don't see that relenting until the money flow stops.""
For a video, click https://vimeo.com/566178073/fe01fdb338
Companies are facing more attacks and the cost of each is rising. Ransomware criminals charged about $350 per attack in 2017 and 2018 and targeted companies with revenue up to about $1 billion, Gow said. Now they target bigger firms and ""we're seeing demands of $30, $40, $50 million with some regularity,"" Gow said. ""It has really shocked the insurance market.""
Beyond ransom, costs include computer network and data restoration, business interruption and liability, said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Schnur, U.S. & Canada cyber brokerage leader at Marsh USA Inc, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC).
Some companies are finding insurers are unable to write coverage, Schnur said, meaning this is a ""hard market"" - a term she resisted using until this year. 
In response, companies are strengthening defenses, and insurers are raising the cost of coverage, trends expected to continue. Companies also want data on how each protective control will help, and by how much, Schnur said.
""We can't stop these things from happening,"" she said. ""We can be more prepared.""
Success is driving cyber crime, along with ""outsourcing"" of hacking technology. Sophisticated groups write powerful hacking tools, then sell ""ransomware kits"" or ""software as a service,"" enabling small criminal gangs to launch attacks.
""It might be that one guy, the rogue guy in the apartment,"" said Allyn Lynd, managing principal at Lodestone, a cyber security unit of insurer Beazley Plc, who spent more than two decades at the FBI.

Companies that pay ransom risk violating the U.S. ban on funding terrorist groups, but at the moment, FBI agents ""are not going to come back a second time and victimize the organization,"" Lynd said.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said Tuesday it will seek applications from users who want to be the first to test new content subscription and ticketing features, as the social platform works to build more ways for users to earn money.
Twitter users can apply to get first access to ""Super Follows,"" which will let them sell exclusive content to paying subscribers, and ""Ticketed Spaces,"" to charge for entry into audio chat rooms they host on the platform.
Both features are part of Twitter's plan to compete with other social media companies to attract more influential content creators by letting them earn money from fan followings.
Users must have at least 10,000 followers on Twitter to be eligible to apply for Super Follows, and at least 1,000 followers to apply for first access to Ticketed Spaces.
The company aims to select ""a diverse set of voices,"" from the applications, said Esther Crawford, senior product manager at Twitter.

The company will take a 3% cut of a creator's revenue until the user hits $50,000 in earnings, after which Twitter will keep 20%, in order to help up-and-coming creators earn more money at the start, Twitter said.
Crawford added that Twitter will focus on individuals who apply for the features, but will also consider brands, publishers and nonprofit organizations which have built an audience on Twitter.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 02:19PM ET</span>",Extreme weather to push property insurance higher -Hippo CEO,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - Extreme weather events and shortage of labour and materials for repairs will push property insurance rates higher in the next several years, the chief executive of U.S. home insurer Hippo said on Tuesday.
As homeowners stayed home during the pandemic, their properties suffered more damage due to issues such as bathroom leaks, and it was harder to get tradespeople in to mop up, Assaf Wand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Hippo said in an interview at the Reuters Future of Insurance USA conference. To see the video, click: https://vimeo.com/566187753/e6e9fea3a1
""The severity of the claims increased quite significantly,"" Wand said, pointing to higher rates charged by plumbers and to buy lumber.
Those prices were likely to normalise as the U.S. economy opens up following the vaccination roll-out, but hurricanes and wildfires are leading to increased damage as more people move to disaster-prone locations, he added.
""I expect to see rates increase over the next several years,"" Wand said.
""Labour and materials keep on increasing...the severity of catastrophic events keeps on increasing.""
Insurers are taking increasing note of climate change, with many fearing the rapid changes could make some premiums unaffordable, especially for customers exposed to extreme weather events.
Insurers and banks are also facing stricter regulatory scrutiny over their response to global warming, with shareholders expecting better disclosures and transparency on climate-related risks. 
One advantage of the pandemic, however, was that ""the world has shifted three to five years forward on digitalization,"" Wand added.
Hippo in March said it would go public through a $5 billion merger with a blank-check firm backed by Silicon Valley heavyweights Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus, in a sign of rising interest in the fast-growing ""insurtech"" sector.
Founded in 2015, Palo Alto-based Hippo sells homeowners insurance online.
Home insurance products offered through Hippo are currently available in 32 U.S. states, covering more than 70% of the country's population, and the company expects its products to be available to 95% of the population by the end of 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the insurance sector to rely heavily on technology to reach customers, helping the ""insurtech"" sector, which uses artificial intelligence and big data.
Both insurance and technology need to do more on inclusion, Wand said.
""These two are industries that are just not diverse enough,"" Wand said, adding that Hippo was hiring data scientists and customer agents from other sectors to help improve diversity. 
""We are trying to push and nudge.""

Insurtech Tractable told Reuters earlier this month that it is keen to boost diversity in a typically male-dominated sector, adding that more than 20% of its software engineers are women, above the industry average. https://reut.rs/3gFtGkC

Amazon said in May that it would buy the U.S. movie studio, home to the James Bond franchise, in an $8.45 billion deal that would give it a huge library of films and TV shows to compete with streaming rivals led by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that the FTC would review the deal.
Lina Khan was sworn in as FTC chair on June 15 in what was broadly seen as a victory for progressives seeking tougher antitrust enforcement. 
In 2017, Khan wrote a highly regarded article, ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" for the Yale Law Journal. It said the traditional antitrust focus on price was inadequate to identify antitrust harms done by Amazon.

The FTC also has an antitrust probe open into Amazon, and has reviewed other mergers that the company has done. The agency shares the work of merger enforcement with the Justice Department.

The vote was 55 to 45 to confirm Fonzone. Five Republicans joined Biden's fellow Democrats to support the nomination.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton said the Huawei ties were a reason to question Fonzone's judgment. ""He (Fonzone) had spent most of his career in government, primarily in national security roles. I cannot imagine that he was not aware of the China threat in general or the Huawei threat in particular,"" Cotton said before the vote.
Fonzone had told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he did less than 50 hours of legal work for both Huawai and China's Ministry of Commerce while working at the law firm Sidley Austin.
Many officials in Washington have targeted Huawei for years as a security threat to U.S. interests.

Read on.Because the COVID-19 pandemic is under control in most major economies, the hype surrounding vaccine producers is gradually tapering off. However, because the population of much of the world, including the United States, is aging, the demand for pharmaceutical products is on the rise. An increasing patient pool with various chronic diseases, and continued treatment innovations for critical diseases, should keep driving the industry’s growth this year and beyond.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 01:07PM ET</span>",Reality check for Volkswagen in China after sluggish start for electric car series,"By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s ID series - the backbone of its electric vehicle ambitions - is off to what even company sources call a worryingly slow start in China.
Sales in May of two ID.4 electric SUV models, launched only two months earlier, came to a mere 1,213 combined. And that was about 200 fewer than in April, according to auto consultancy LMC.
The sales fall far short of initial hopes, four people with knowledge of the matter said, and what some other automakers have achieved with early sales of flagship EV offerings in the world's largest auto market.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s venture with state-owned SAIC Motor, which makes the slightly bigger ID.4 X model, had been targeting sales of 50,000-60,000 vehicles this year, according to comments by Yang Siyao, a company marketing executive, in Chinese media in March. 
A separate venture between the world's No. 2 automaker and FAW which makes the ID.4 CROZZ had similar targets, one of the sources said. Those goals now seem unrealistic.
Furthermore, both ventures' EV plants are running below 10% of production capacity, according to three of the people. 
The sources blamed the less than auspicious debut on a lack of smart tech features, fierce competition, a late launch compared to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Chinese EV makers as well as hiccups with its new EV sales network.
""Sales so far are behind our earlier expectations. We've had to dial down production plans for the ID.4 again and again,"" said one person, who like the other sources was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
""This is not healthy, but at the moment customers are not coming to buy them.""
In another sign of sales stress, SAIC-Volkswagen has suggested staff members buy ID.4s, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
By comparison, Tesla sold 6,612 of its Model Y in China in the first two months after its launch. The ID.4's sales performance in China also contrasts sharply with Europe, where it is a top-selling electric car with 12,101 sold in the first two months post-launch, according to JATO Dynamics.
Volkswagen said in a statement to Reuters that ID. China sales were in line with expectations as it builds up production and a new sales network, adding it does not view Tesla's Model Y as a direct competitor for the ID.4, which occupies a different vehicle type segment.
It also said it was confident the two ID.4 models would see sales growth and noted plans for three more ID models to be launched this year in China.
NOT SMART ENOUGH?
More than any other country, China has aggressively pushed for the adoption of electric cars, introducing sales quotas as it seeks to cut pollution, encourage the growth of its auto industry and reduce reliance on oil.
Volkswagen, the country's biggest foreign automaker with 3.85 million vehicles - mostly gasoline - sold last year, has more riding on successfully transitioning its customers to EVs than the average automaker. It has also declared its intention to surpass Tesla as the world's top EV maker by 2025, ensuring that China will become a crucial battleground. 
But getting customers on board is another matter altogether.
At a shopping mall in western Shanghai last week, David Qian, a 50-year-old engineer, was looking for an EV for his wife but found he was not drawn to the ID.4 X, which starts at just under 200,000 yuan ($31,000).
""The car looks okay but I know it is not smart enough,"" said Qian, who owns a Tesla Model 3 and enthuses about its assisted driving technology.
Unlike Tesla models and a growing number of vehicles from Chinese electric car makers like Xpeng Inc and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, the ID.4 cannot park itself and does not offer advanced self-driving features or advanced voice-controlled functions.
""Chinese consumers value the sense of technology and science fiction of electric vehicles, and brand loyalty has always been low which is completely different from the European market,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.
And unlike Europe, electric car competition is already cutthroat in China, where a plethora of manufacturers compete and the top-selling Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, an entry-level sedan made by a General Motors (NYSE:GM) joint venture, costs just 28,800 yuan ($4,450).
At the shopping mall where Qian checked out the ID.4, the SAIC-Volkswagen showroom is right next door to a store run by Xpeng and close to rival stores belonging to EV startup Neta and Huawei, which sells an electric car in partnership with automaker Seres. A store for Chinese EV maker Aiways is also set to open nearby soon.
""Compared with Europe, this car has too much competition and they are all new models with a strong tech sense,"" said Zhang.
Volkswagen said in its statement it would be offering new software feature updates in the future and with newer models.
TEETHING PROBLEMS
Volkswagen has been faster than some other foreign automakers in China with EV development such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, but sources say ideally it should have moved quicker. 
Its joint ventures' EV plants, which can each build 300,000 vehicles per year, were ready for mass production in early 2020 but time taken to develop the vehicles in Germany meant the new ID.4s did not get regulatory approval until July, they added.
At the distribution level, Volkswagen is grappling with the introduction of new sales strategies popular with pure-play EV competitors.
Rather than relying predominantly on its existing roughly 2,000-dealer network, it is shifting to an agency sales model for EVs where showrooms are typically located in shopping malls, prices are fixed and there is no inventory for showroom operators.
The lack of inventory, however, has meant that staff who are used to the pressure inventory brings have less financial motivation to sell product, people familiar with the matter said.
Volkswagen said in its statement that production at its EV plants was running on schedule and that internal feedback on its new agency model is very positive.

It had 12 ID. stores in China as of end-May and plans to have more than 100 stores by the end of this year. It is also boosting its number of ID. sales agents to more than 1,000 by the year's end from 825 currently.

The company, whose shares are up more than 960% this year, was the spark in January for a battle casting hedge fund short-sellers against a pack of small-time investors organizing online. 
It remains one of the hottest and most visible ""meme stocks"" and was up nearly 9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.
The company, like others of the social-media hyped stocks that have lit up Wall Street since January, has sold millions of dollars in new stock on the back of what institutional players say are speculative share moves unjustified by their businesses.
Cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), another meme play, completed two share issues in three days earlier this month, while Torchlight Energy on Monday upsized its own share sale to $250 million.
GameStop said it would use the net proceeds from the offering, which adds to $551 million it raised in late April, for general corporate purposes as well as for investing in growth initiatives.
The company is trying to pivot to e-commerce and recently hired a former Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) official as its new chief executive officer to steer it through the transition.

Its shares dipped sharply when it announced the share offer earlier this month and have fallen another 10% since, even after Tuesday's initial moves. 
White Square Capital, a London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January, is shutting down, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 01:02PM ET</span>","Even after Biden tax hike, U.S. firms would pay less than foreign rivals","By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - U.S. companies pay less income tax than their overseas competitors and would likely continue to do so under a tax hike proposed by President Joe Biden, according to a Reuters analysis of filings by hundreds of U.S. and international firms.
The analysis undercuts arguments by some company executives and trade groups that Biden's plan would leave U.S. firms paying some of the world’s highest taxes and struggling to compete against foreign rivals. Industry representatives have aggressively lobbied against the proposal, which would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, from the current 21%. The president also wants a minimum tax of 21% on overseas income, up from 10.5%.
U.S. corporations typically pay less - sometimes much less - than those statutory rates because the U.S. tax code is unusually generous with tax breaks and deductions, and in allowing overseas tax planning, according to the Reuters analysis. The analysis was reviewed by four academics with experience in measuring corporate tax payments.
Reuters examined the effective tax rates – reflecting the actual tax payments companies reported – of 52 of the largest U.S.-based multinational firms, and then compared them to the rates paid by these companies’ main overseas competitors. The U.S. companies paid an average effective tax rate of 16% in 2020 compared to an average rate of 24% paid by 200 foreign companies that the U.S. firms named as their competitors in filings.
If Biden’s proposed tax rates were applied to the U.S. firms’ 2020 earnings, the companies would have paid effective rates averaging about five percentage points higher, or 21%, the Reuters analysis found.
That’s still lower than the average rate paid by their overseas competitors. Moreover, U.S. firms would likely retain a bigger tax advantage over their foreign rivals than the analysis shows, for two reasons. First, the Reuters calculations do not account for the impact of new tax breaks for U.S. firms that Biden proposes to encourage domestic manufacturing and clean-energy investments. Second, the Biden plan would also require foreign companies with U.S. operations to pay higher taxes on their U.S. income.
Business lobby groups have argued that the Biden proposal, which requires congressional approval, would leave domestic firms at the mercy of their foreign rivals.
“Such tax increases would make the United States uncompetitive as a place to do business and make U.S. companies uncompetitive globally,” said Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, which represents about 200 large U.S. companies, when the measures were first announced on March 31.
The trade group said comparisons of effective tax rates, as in the Reuters analysis, can be “informative” but are only one of many valid ways to analyze how taxes impact the global competitiveness of U.S. firms. The organization said that simpler comparisons of statutory tax rates among nations - without considering deductions, credits and overseas tax planning - also accurately reflect the incentives for firms to locate in one nation versus another.
Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment on Reuters’ findings but said: “Higher taxes will hinder investment and competitiveness for U.S. businesses, ultimately hurting U.S. workers.”
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chairman of the Senate finance committee, dismissed such arguments. “The data are clear: U.S. mega-corporations are contributing far too little to federal revenues, particularly in comparison to foreign counterparts,” Wyden told Reuters.
Reuters ran its findings by Biden’s Treasury Department and the White House. The White House said in a statement: “This reporting highlights that the corporate tax code is broken. The largest corporations don’t pay their fair share in the United States, and pay less in other competitor countries.” Biden’s proposal, the White House said, is designed to address “the tax games and giveaways that underlie the rock-bottom tax rates described by this reporting.”
Republican leaders who have said the proposed hikes will damage U.S. firms’ competitiveness, including Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas, declined to comment on the Reuters analysis. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, did not respond to requests for comment.
Democrats in Congress are pushing a bill to implement Biden’s plan. It could come up for a vote any time in the divided Senate. Its success may rely on the support of one Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has pushed for lower tax rates than Biden wants. All Republican senators are expected to oppose it.
All of the 52 U.S. firms Reuters examined, and in most cases their overseas rivals, published detailed reconciliations explaining the deviation between their actual tax bill and the statutory tax rate in their home countries. These disclosures show that the U.S. firms’ relatively low effective tax rates stem from business-friendly provisions unique to the United States.
For example, U.S. tax breaks to encourage research and other activities generate bigger savings than similar breaks in other nations. The U.S. allows tax deductions for many expenses - such as client entertainment, stock-based compensation and certain legal costs - that are not typically deductible elsewhere. And U.S. companies can save far more money by shifting profits into tax-haven nations than, for instance, their rivals in Japan, Germany or France, whose governments limit such maneuvers.
RIDDLED WITH LOOPHOLES
Analyses cited by several business groups have said U.S. businesses currently face an average combined state and federal statutory tax rate of nearly 26% and that Biden’s plan would raise their rates to 32%.
Consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers noted the average nominal tax rate among developed countries was 23% - lower than Biden’s proposed rate of 28% - and urged companies to lobby against the increases. Johnson & Johnson’s Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts in April that Biden’s plan would make the U.S. rate the highest among developed countries.
Such simplified comparisons, however, do not reflect actual taxes paid after deductions, credits and other advantages enjoyed by U.S. firms. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), for instance, paid an effective tax rate of less than 11% in 2020, according to the company’s annual report. The pharmaceutical giant did not comment on Reuters findings but said tax policy should create a “level playing field” for U.S. firms internationally.
PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment.
In another typical example, Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) – the California-based publisher of hit video games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft – reported paying an effective tax rate of 16% last year. Two of its main competitors,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Corporation and Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974), are based in Japan and paid effective tax rates of 22% and 28%, respectively, according to their annual reports.
Activision declined to comment for this story.
The company slashed its tax payments through tax breaks and deductions and by operating subsidiaries in tax-haven nations. Activision has, for instance, saved hundreds of millions in taxes over the past decade, company filings show, by reporting billions of dollars in profits through a subsidiary based in Bermuda, an island with no corporate tax. Activision reported that it reduced its overall effective tax rate in 2020 by 4 percentage points because of the low tax rates paid by its foreign subsidiaries.
Activision rivals Sony and Nintendo each generate about three-fourths of their revenues outside of Japan, compared to about half for Activision. And yet Nintendo reported that taxes on overseas income reduced its effective tax rate by just 0.6 percentage points, while Sony reported a decrease of 2.4 percentage points.
Tax havens such as Bermuda don’t provide the same benefit to Japanese firms. Japan has a law that allows authorities to levy Japanese corporate taxes of about 30% on any income reported from operations in foreign jurisdictions with a tax rate of less than 20%. Similar rules are common in industrialized nations other than the United States. 
STATE TAX BREAKS
Another reason Activision paid a relatively low effective tax rate is that its tax payments to U.S. states only increased the company’s total rate by 2 percentage points. That’s typical: On average, the effective rates of the 52 U.S. multinationals examined by Reuters were raised by just 1 percentage point by state tax payments. Business groups often cite 4% or 5% as the typical state tax burden, based on averages of statutory state rates that usually do not equate to actual taxes paid.
A host of factors lower companies’ state tax payments. States often lure companies with tax breaks, and compete with one another to offer the most generous incentives. Also, companies only pay state taxes on their U.S.-based income. And they can lower the bill further by apportioning earnings to relatively low-tax states.
At the federal level, companies drive down their tax bill through a host of deductions or credits that are often unavailable or limited in other nations. U.S. firms, for instance, can deduct the cost of share grants as compensation to executives and staff. Activision reported lowering its effective tax rate by 1 percentage point through such deductions. On average, the U.S. firms examined by Reuters reduced achieved savings of 2.6% from that provision.
The video game firm shaved an additional 3 percentage points off its tax bill by collecting tax credits for research and development spending. Its competitors Nintendo and Sony reported smaller tax savings from research credits.
Such credits are available to an array of U.S. firms, and not just in research-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Sport apparel giant  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), for instance, lowered its effective tax rate by 2 percentage points in 2020 through R&D credits. Two-thirds of the 52 U.S. companies Reuters examined reported similar benefits, with an average tax reduction of about 3 percentage points.
Research tax credits are common outside the United States, but typically worth less, often not enough to warrant company disclosure. Just 18 firms of the 200 foreign competitors to U.S. firms examined by Reuters reported benefits from research or other tax credits.

Some U.S. companies, to be sure, will take a bigger hit than others from Biden’s tax plan. But even if U.S. companies collectively sustain a bigger tax hit than foreseen, they would still be well-placed to compete, the analysis shows. On average, the 52 U.S.-based companies examined by Reuters had profit margins of 24%, well above than the average margin of 14% among their 200 foreign competitors.
“The argument on ‘competitiveness’ is code for ‘corporations should pay no taxes’,” said Senator Wyden, “and it doesn’t hold water.”

The Finnish telecom equipment maker conducted a survey of its employees at the end of last year and a majority said they wanted to work two to three days per week remotely, up from an average of two days before the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The pandemic forced organisations to change. Technology gave people the tools to innovate. In many cases, the results have been too good to go back to the old way of doing things,"" Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark said.

863,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",4 Inflation-Resistant Stocks to Buy This Summer,"Rising inflation due to the fast-paced economic recovery and improving job market has been raising concerns over the potential for a stock market correction. However, the business models and the nature of products delivered by Procter & Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Centerra (CGAU), and Preformed Line (PLPC) we think make their stocks inflation resistant. So, one could hedge one’s portfolio against rising inflation by betting on these stocks. Let’s discuss these names.The faster-than-expected U.S. economic recovery, driven by ultra-loose monetary policy, several fiscal stimulus packages and an improving job market, has caused the inflation rates in the United States to climb to 13-year highs. In May 2021, the Consumer Price Index increased 5% year-over-year, making it the largest 12-month rise since August 2008. The Federal Reserve expects the inflation rate to rise further in the near term, driven by increasing consumer spending and impressive job growth. The Fed forecasts inflation to be 3.4% in 2021.
Given the rising price levels—which could precipitate a stock market correction—betting on inflation-resistant stocks could be the way to hedge the current downside risk in an investment portfolio. Because industries such as consumer goods, manufacturing and precious metals typically perform well even in an inflationary environment, it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound stocks from these industries.
We believe Procter & Gamble Company (PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Centerra Gold Inc. (CGAU), and Preformed Line Products Company (PLPC) have the potential to deliver solid returns, dodging the consequences of rising inflation.

864,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",Silver Fundamentals Remain Strong Despite Fed's Hawkish Pivot,"Silver (SLV) is down for the month and weakened significantly following the FOMC meeting. Taylor Dart breaks down why the dip could be a good buying opportunity.It's been a rough month so far for the silver (SLV) market, with the metal down 10% in less than 20 trading days, erasing its outperformance vs. the S&P-500 (SPY). Following last week's negative reaction to the Federal Reserve Meeting, silver's year-to-date return now stands at a paltry (-) 1%, vs. a (+) 12% return for the S&P-500. This significant underperformance has put a minor dent in the Silver/S&P-500 ratio. Fortunately, it hasn't inflicted any material damage to silver's technical picture or the Silver/Gold ratio, which continues to trend higher. The good news is that we continue to track quite similar to the early 2000 analog, with the base-on-base pattern still intact. Let's take a closer look:
(Source: TradingView.com)
If we look at the chart above, we can see that silver broke out of a massive multi-year base in 2005 and spent nearly two years going sideways before resuming its trend and making new highs. Just last year, silver also broke out of a multi-year base to new highs and has spent nearly 12 months going sideways now in a volatile 25% range. This volatile range is likely frustrating many investors, but it's pivotal to stay focused on the big picture. Unfortunately, many weak hands are shaken out during these base-on-base setups, left exiting near the lows in the early innings of a new bull market.

Investing.com –  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL), the company behind the dating app with the same name, is giving its 700 employees a week off to recover from burnout suffered during the pandemic, CNBC reported.
The stock was up more than 2% in Tuesday’s session before giving up some of the gains.
The week off is in addition to the company’s normal vacation allowance.
CNBC referred to a tweet by Bumble’s Head of Editorial Content Clare O’Connor that said the CEO, Whitney Wolfe, had “correctly intuited our collective burnout.” That tweet is no longer available.
“In the U.S. especially, where vacation days are notoriously scarce, it feels like a big deal,” O’Connor added in the widely reported tweet on Monday."
867,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>",Airlines Count on Zoom Fatigue to Drive Business Travel Revival,"(Bloomberg) -- After more than a year stuck on video calls, company executives are ready to hit the skies and meet customers face to face again, fueling airline industry optimism that business travel is poised to rebound despite the rise of Covid-era workarounds like Zoom.
The lifting of travel restrictions will trigger a sharp rebound in corporate travel, executives from Qatar Airways, IAG (LON:ICAG) SA and Rwandair said Tuesday on a panel at the Qatar Economic Forum. Business-class occupancy on Qatar Airways flights is 10 percentage points higher than it was before the pandemic in markets where travel is allowed, said Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of the Gulf carrier.
“People don’t like to just sit in front of a screen and conduct business,” Al Baker said. “Businessmen like to face people, they like to feel people, they like to notice the body language.”
Even as air travel slowly rebounds with the rollout of vaccines gathering pace in most major economies, getting business travel back on track is a key objective for airlines since the premium seats are such a big profit contributor. With face-to-face travel cut off, many companies have adopted new methods of reaching out to customers and co-workers. Those adjustments, along with a rising imperative to reduce carbon emissions, has led to questions about whether corporate road warriors will return in force after the health crisis is over.
“The shape of business travel may change, but face-to-face meetings are going to be crucial,” said Luis Gallego, CEO of British Airways parent IAG. About half of IAG’s corporate customers -- a group which contributed about a third of the carrier group’s revenue pre-pandemic -- have said that they will fly before the end of the year, Gallego said.
While companies may cut down on internal travel, they will continue to send executives to meet customers and build new markets, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. CEO David Calhoun said on the same panel.
“It’s a net gain for travel,” Calhoun said. “We live on competition, competition is what drives travel.”
Before any of that can happen, travel restrictions need to be lifted, aviation officials maintain. Carriers are pushing for governments to coordinate on rules to help reopen international and long-distance routes.
“Vaccinated people should be able to travel freely,” said Rwandair CEO Yvonne Makolo. Otherwise, continued quarantines and travel restrictions will continue to disrupt the industry and delay the recovery, she said.

McDonald’s was up 0.7% while Chipotle gained 1.5% as the two set out to retain the jump in customers in post-Covid times.
For McDonald’s, the July 8 launch of the company’s first-ever loyalty program in the U.S means it joins Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR)’ Popeyes and  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM)’ Taco Bell in having such incentives.
Loyalty programs tend to make people spend more while giving companies valuable insights about their consumer behavior.
According to CNBC, McDonald’s program will allow customers to earn 100 points for every dollar they spend. They can work toward 16 rewards options, split up into four different tiers. The easiest items, like hash browns or a cheeseburger, cost just 1,500 points to redeem. A Happy Meal or Big Mac will set members back 6,000 points.
While McDonald’s gets ready to launch its program, Chipotle announced an expansion of its existing scheme to offer more redemption options to members.
Wednesday onward, customers will get a new video game called Chipotle Race to Rewards Exchange.

So, we think home improvement retailers  Home Depot  (HD), Lowe's Company (NYSE:LOW), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) are well positioned to generate solid growth this year and beyond. Read on.The COVID-19-pandemic-induced requirement that people spend more time indoors at their homes, and the motivation to remodel houses to suit work, school, and leisure purposes, continue to drive the home improvement industry’s growth. This trend is expected to continue because consumers who gained confidence in their house remodeling skills may well spend even more on revamping their existing spaces. In fact, a rising preference for luxurious and energy-efficient living spaces is also contributing significantly to the sector’s growth.
The global home improvement market is expected to reach $1207.80 billion by 2027, growing at a 4.5% CAGR from $887.53 billion in 2020. The rapid pace of urbanization, coupled with rising disposable income, is also expected to bolster the industry’s growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S Commerce Department said Monday it was rescinding a list of prohibited transactions with TikTok and WeChat that were issued in September as the Trump administration sought to block new U.S. downloads of both Chinese-owned apps.
The withdrawals came after President Joe Biden this month withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of Tencent-owned WeChat and TikTok, and ordered a Commerce Department review of security concerns posed by those apps and others.
During Donald Trump's presidency, the Commerce Department had also sought to ban other transactions that would have effectively banned WeChat's use in the United States and later sought similar restrictions that would have barred TikTok's use.
The department did not immediately comment.
China's foreign ministry described the move as ""a positive step.""
""China has been urging the U.S. side to respect market economy principles and international trade rules, to immediately stop stretching the concept of national security and stop wantonly abusing state power to suppress China's tech companies,"" spokesman Zhai Lijian said on Tuesday in Beijing.
The Biden order directed the Commerce Department to monitor software applications like TikTok that could affect U.S. national security, as well as to make recommendations within 120 days to protect U.S. data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries.
WeChat, which has been downloaded at least 19 million times by U.S. users, is widely used as a medium for services, games and payments.
Biden's executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders Trump issued in August, along with another in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.
The January Trump order directed officials to ban transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat pay. No bans have been issued to date.

The Trump administration had appealed judicial orders blocking the bans on TikTok and WeChat, but after Biden took office in January, the U.S. Justice Department asked to pause the appeals.
A separate U.S. national security review of TikTok, launched in late 2019, remains active.

Japan's third-largest automaker will halt production at a factory in Tochigi, eastern Japan, for a total of three days in July, the sources said, declining to be identified because the plan is not public.
It will idle its plant in Kyushu, southern Japan for two days next month, they said, adding that the factory will cancel the night shift as well. 
Another Kyushu plant will also only operate on daytime shift work for a certain period next month, the people said.
Nissan's Oppama plant, another domestic assembly plant located in Kanagawa, has been adjusting production since mid-May by operating without a night shift and will continue to do so in July, the sources said.
""Due to the global chip shortage, Nissan is adjusting production and is taking necessary actions to ensure recovery,"" a Nissan spokesperson said, without elaborating.
Nissan, like other automakers, has been making production adjustments because of a worldwide chip supply crunch. The automaker has said the shortage will likely affect the production of 500,000 vehicles this year.

The automaker's chief executive Makoto Uchida told shareholders at the annual general meeting earlier on Tuesday that the company was minimising the negative impact of the chip shortage. 
He added that Nissan was trying to make up for the production loss within the financial year and to take action to ensure stability in its supply of parts.

879,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>",Direct Listings Struggle to Live Up to Silicon Valley Hype,"(Bloomberg) -- They were hailed as Silicon Valley’s answer to the traditional Wall Street IPO. A way for founders of hot tech startups to sidestep the hefty fees and the millions of dollars potentially left on the table when bankers took them public.
But now, some are wondering whether direct listings can live up to the hype.
A string of high-profile direct listings, including Squarespace Inc. and ZipRecruiter Inc. flopped recently, but Coinbase Global Inc. was particularly notable. Since going public in April with plenty of fanfare, the cryptocurrency exchange has slumped, even dropping below its so-called reference price, a level skeptics have called an artificially low bar to pass. Squarespace breached its reference price its debut session, the first direct listing to do so. A muted start for ZipRecruiter stood out from a series of pops by traditional initial public offerings.
Meanwhile, initial public offerings made a comeback and the spectacular, albeit short-lived, rise of SPACs has also pushed direct listings out of the limelight.
“We hit the peak of the hype cycle,” said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. “Now, everyone is taking a step back to reset expectations on prices and near-term volatility.”
The next test could come with app-maker TrillerNet, which reportedly plans to file for a direct listing next month at a valuation of more than $5 billion. Other companies advancing plans for possible direct listings include analytics startup Amplitude Inc. and digital-payments provider Wise, the first major technology company to choose this route in the U.K.
Representatives for Coinbase and Squarespace declined to comment. ZipRecruiter didn’t respond to a request for comment.

 Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) put direct listings on the map more than three years ago when it opted to list in the U.S. without hiring a long list of banks to run the traditional marketing blitz to sell its shares through an IPO. A half dozen other well-known tech companies like Palantir Technologies Inc. followed by directly listing nearly $200 billion of equity on New York exchanges based on their market capitalization when they debuted. Unlike IPOs, direct listings typically don’t raise money.
The recent stumbles coincided with a general pullback in U.S. equities in April and May and traditional IPOs weren’t immune. Still, direct listings haven’t caught on with the same momentum as another newly popular way of going public: merging with a special purpose acquisition company that conducted its own IPO.
In another sign that attention has moved on, the meme-stock phenomenon has allowed hordes of small investors to push back against big Wall Street players and cash in on beaten up shares of long-listed companies like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
But direct listings were meant to be a better mechanism for going public -- hailed by venture capitalists as a way to side-step banking fees and a process criticized as favoring the best clients of Wall Street firms.
That 7% fee can stand out to executives and investors who are more accustomed to 2% fees during private stock sales.
“The only two places where spreads haven’t narrowed in the last 20 years is houses and IPOs,” Colas said, referring to the fees bankers earn on these deals. “From the venture capital standpoint, I don’t know this trading is going to change their minds a whole lot, because they still see that 7% spread.”
Direct listings may be working as designed by their private investors, but they’ve left public investors flummoxed on more than one occasion. Scrutiny of reference prices -- a figure provided on the first day of trading as guidance -- surround each debut, and have contributed to wild price swings.
“The process around setting a reference price is probably something that needs to be looked at more closely,” MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an interview. “Simply because there is no clear and hard evidence of what appetite investors have prior to the setting of the reference price -- very much unlike the book building process in an IPO.”
With much less historical data available than for IPOs, traders then have trouble with basic questions such as when to enter their position.
“The market is still trying to figure direct listings out,” University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter said in an interview. “The opening price has been higher than the closing price with most of them. I don’t expect that to continue, because the people who are buying at the open are going to say, ‘Well if there’s a predicable price decline during the day, why should I buy at the open instead of the afternoon?’”
Bumpy Path
To some, the volatility and uncertainty are a small trade-off for a more democratic way to go public that doesn’t let investment bankers award shares to preferred clients at a discount. But cracks are emerging in that line of thinking, too. Coinbase raised $1.25 billion in private offering of equity-linked securities one month after its listing that was designed to skip an IPO.
For Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas, the opaque supply-demand dynamics are the hardest part of going public by direct listing.
“You’re not allowed to ask your investors what they plan to sell, and so you go in with a lot of unknowns,” Haas said at the Bloomberg Deals Summit, adding that this can create a “bumpy path” for a listing.

Investing.com –  Shoe Carnival  (NASDAQ:SCVL) rose nearly 4% during Monday’s session after the company’s positive guidance and the announcement of a stock split.
For fiscal 2021, Shoe Carnival anticipates net sales to be in excess of $1.15 billion and diluted net income per share to be in excess of $6 pre-stock split.
The EPS is seen in excess of $3 post-stock split.
Net sales are expected to surpass any previous full fiscal year record by over $100 million, and diluted net income per share is expected to more than double the company’s previous fiscal year record of $2.92 per share on pre-split basis.
The footwear retailer will also do a two-for-one stock split. Each holder of the company’s common stock will get one share for every share held.
The record date for the stock split is July 6. The dividend shares are scheduled to be distributed on July 19. The company expects the adjusted number of shares outstanding and adjusted per share stock price to be effective July 20.
The recently announced cash dividend of 14 cents per share, which is also payable on July 19, will be paid on a pre-split basis."

(Reuters) -Aston Martin is suing a Swiss car dealer that it says withheld customer payments for its $3 million Valkyrie sports car, ending commercial ties with the dealer that helped to finance the British luxury carmaker during a rocky period.
The London-listed company said it would now take customer deposits directly for special vehicles such as the Valkyrie rather than involve a third party.
Under a 2016 agreement, the Swiss company Nebula had helped to finance the development of the Valkyrie and other mid-engine cars, an area of focus for Aston Martin, in return for royalties from the carmaker. 
Aston Martin said ending that contract meant it no longer had to pay future royalties, a claim Nebula disputes.
Nebula said it considered Aston Martin's allegations entirely unfounded.
""We consider Aston Martin's alleged unilateral termination of the contractual relationship with Nebula Project AG as illegitimate and unjustified and are prepared to pursue the necessary steps to preserve our rights,"" Nebula said in a statement.
Analysts at A.J. Bell said in a note that the royalty component of the dispute was likely to be hard fought in court as Nebula had stepped in with funding during a ""very rough patch financially"" for Aston Martin. 
Since going public in 2018, Aston Martin has burnt through cash, prompting billionaire chairman Lawrence Stroll to buy a stake in the company as part of plans to raise money.
Aston Martin on Tuesday projected a possible 15-million-pound ($21 million) hit to its 2021 results because of the alleged withheld payments from Nebula but said it was on course to meet annual financial expectations.
Aston Martin would ensure affected customers received their cars as scheduled, the company said.
A source close to Aston Martin said its case would be filed in a Swiss court on Tuesday, though neither the source nor the company disclosed the size of damages being sought.
The Valkyrie is a limited-edition supercar that utilises Formula One technology and sells for about $3 million, though the company has not listed an official price. First deliveries are on track for the second half of this year, the company said.
Aston Martin is also ending agreements with AF Cars AG, which runs its St. Gallen dealership in Switzerland and is led by Nebula board members, saying that some cars were sold in breach of dealership agreements.

Aston Martin shares were down 1.4% by 1440 GMT on Tuesday.

The German lender can avoid a higher bar for equity requirements if it can effectively reduce its risk exposure, the report said, before the ECB sets targets for 2022 by the end of the year. 
""We have a strong track record in the (leveraged loan) business and we follow a prudent risk management approach in line with regulatory requirements,"" Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) said.

ECB's move could complicate matters for Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who embarked on a radical restructuring two years ago in an effort to return the bank to profitability.
The bank's first-quarter net profit was strongest in seven years, driven by its investment banking activities that outperformed major U.S. rivals.

Stifel reiterated a buy rating and a $168 price target on the stock, while BTIG lowered the price target to $153 from $162 while maintaining a buy, StreetInsider reported.
Shares were little changed. The company reports earnings on Thursday, and is expected to publish a profit of 51 cents per share on sales of $11.11 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Stifel analyst Jim Duffy reaffirmed above-consensus sales and earnings targets for the quarter.   
""The business has capacity for higher sales growth and gross margin expansion (we model +12% y/y and +310bps y/y), though we expect NKE positions guidance conservatively at the outset of the fiscal year, establishing a beat-raise cadence as FY22 unfolds,"" Duffy wrote in a note. ""Supply chain issues and early quarter demand in Greater China pose two discrete risks, both of which we believe are short-term considerations."" 
""Ultimately, we view NIKE’s global category positioning and capacity for improved margins and returns as rationale for the stock to remain a core large-cap growth holding,"" Duffy said.
BTIG's Camilo Lyon cited the potential disruption of the preference of national brands like Anta over international ones by younger consumers. ""With respect to our 4Q estimates, we see NKE delivering an in line quarter relative to our/consensus estimates of ~76% sales growth and $0.51 in EPS, as we believe softening sell-through China data in the last two months of the quarter will show up in weaker orders in future quarters,"" Lyon wrote in a note. 
""While we believe NKE can ultimately flex its marketing and innovation muscles to overcome these hurdles and further distance itself from the competition, we could see near term sales volatility in Greater China,"" Lyon said.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 09:58AM ET</span>",YouTube wins user copyright fight in top EU court ruling,"By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -Google's YouTube won its latest copyright-infringement challenge after Europe's top court said online platforms are not liable for users uploading unauthorised works unless the platforms failed to take quick action to remove or block access to the content.
The case marks the latest development in a long-running battle between Europe's $1 trillion creative industry and online platforms, with the former seeking redress for unauthorised works that are uploaded.
It is also part of the wider debate on how much online platforms and social media should do to police the posting of unauthorised, illegal or hateful content, an issue that European Union regulators are targeting with tough new rules that could come into force next year.
""As currently stands, operators of online platforms do not, in principle, themselves make a communication to the public of copyright-protected content illegally posted online by users of those platforms,"" the EU Court of Justice said.
""However, those operators do make such a communication in breach of copyright where they contribute, beyond merely making those platforms available, to giving access to such content to the public,"" judges said.
The EU court said platforms could also be liable if they do not put in place the appropriate technological tools to tackle copyright breaches by their users or where they provide tools on their platforms for illegal sharing of content.
In response to the court ruling a YouTube spokesperson said: ""YouTube is a leader in copyright and supports rights holders being paid their fair share.""
""That's why we've invested in state of the art copyright tools which have created an entirely new revenue stream for the industry. In the past 12 months alone we have paid $4 billion to the music industry, over 30% of which comes from monetised user generated content.""
The case underlines a long-running debate on the responsibilities of online platforms, with the CJEU giving useful guidance to national courts assessing such disagreements, said Nils Rauer, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.
""The core question is and remains whether the platform is in a rather passive role (no liability) or in an active role (liability). There is a fine line between those two roles,"" he said.
""With today's ruling, the domestic courts will be able to build on more guidance from Luxembourg where to draw the line between the good ones (platforms) and the bad ones,"" he said. 
YouTube found itself in the dock after Frank Peterson, a music producer, sued the company and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in Germany over the uploading to YouTube by users in 2008 of several phonograms to which he holds the rights.
In a second case, publishing group Elsevier took legal action against file-hosting service Cyando in Germany after its users uploaded several Elsevier works on its platform Uploaded in 2013 without its approval.
A German court subsequently sought advice from the EU Court of Justice, which ruled on both cases on Tuesday.
Existing EU rules exempt YouTube and its peers from such liability regarding copyright when they are told of violations and remove them.
The EU last year overhauled its copyright rules for the first time in two decades to help its creative industries by adopting a key provision known as Article 17. This requires YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram and other sharing platforms to install filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials.
But this has drawn criticism from civil rights groups worried about potential censorship by authoritarian governments and risks to freedom of expression.
Several EU countries have yet to transpose the EU law into national legislation, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The European Commission has also proposed much a more wide-ranging Digital Services Act, which sets stringent obligations on very large online companies, online platforms and hosting services, backed by fines up to 6% of a company's revenue for non-compliance.
This would apply to websites, internet infrastructure services and online platforms such as online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.

The draft rules need to be thrashed out with EU countries and EU lawmakers before they can become law, likely to be next year.
The cases are C-682/18 YouTube and C-683/18 Cyando.

(Reuters) - I've just come out of a long-term lockdown. Can we be friends?
Amorous entanglements aren't uppermost in the minds of many people emerging from long periods of pandemic isolation. Instead, they crave the friendships and social groups they have been starved of over the past year.
That's the verdict of dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble, which are launching or acquiring new services focused entirely on making and maintaining friends.
""There's a really interesting trend that has been taking place in the connection space, which is this desire to have platonic relationships,"" said Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd. 
""People are seeking friendship in ways they would have only done offline before the pandemic.""
Her company is investing in its Bumble BFF (best friends forever) feature, which it said comprised about 9% of Bumble's total monthly active users in September 2020 and ""has room to grow as we increase our focus on this space"". 
Meanwhile its archrival Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) - owner of a string of apps including Tinder and Hinge - is also pushing beyond love and lust. It paid $1.7 billion this year for South Korean social media firm Hyperconnect, whose apps let people chat from across the world using real-time translation. 
Hyperconnect's revenue jumped 50% last year, while Meetup, which helps you meet people with similar interests at local or online events, has seen a 22% rise in new members since January.
Meetup's most searched word this year was ""friends"". 
'FRIENDS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR'
Such friendship services have experienced increased engagement from users since COVID-19 restrictions have gradually been lifted around the world, allowing people to meet in person, according to Evercore analyst Shweta Kharjuria, who said that it made sound business sense to court more customers.
""This opens up the total available market from targeting only singles to singles and married people,"" she said. 
The importance of physical contact was echoed by Amos, a 22-year-old French au pair using Bumble BFF in London. 
""Getting the momentum going is hard online and if everything IRL (in real life) is closed,"" he said. ""You never really connect until you meet in person.""
Rosie, a 24-year-old dental nurse living in the city of Bristol in southwestern England, struggled to connect with her older co-workers during lockdown and began using Bumble BFF three weeks ago to meet new people.
""I'm a very sociable person and like meeting new people, but never found the opportunities. I've gone from having just Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) texting me to this app buzzing quite a bit, which is nice, it seems a lot of girls are in my position.""
Nupur, a 25-year-old teacher from the city of Pune in western India who uses both Tinder and Bumble, said the apps' efforts to promote themselves as a way of finding friends rather than just hook-ups and love ""could work very well"".
""I've met a couple of people online and we've met up and have been friends for more than a year now.""
Indeed friend-making networks such as MeetMe and Yubo have even outstripped some popular dating apps in terms of daily engagement over the past few months, according to market research firm Apptopia.
Jess Carbino, an online dating expert and former sociologist for Tinder and Bumble, told Reuters that social isolation had been ""staggering"" due to the pandemic, particularly for single people living alone.
""(This) has inspired people to use the tools available to them, namely technology, to find companionship and connection.""

LGBTQ+ dating apps have done a lot to push the social aspect of dating, according to brokerage Canaccord Genuity, with China's Blued offers surrogacy services, for example, and Taimi providing livestreaming.
Gay dating app Hornet, meanwhile, aims to be more of a social network focused on users' personal interests, rather than solely a hook-up service centred on physical looks and proximity.
Hornet's founder and CEO Christof Wittig said it was unlikely that people would revert to the ""old ways"" of connecting with their community exclusively offline, such as through nightlife, activism or LGBTQ sport events.
Witting said the number of users tapping the newsfeed, comments and videos rose 37% in the year to May.

He said the number of people looking for friendship and community online had increased during lockdowns when people turned to digital platforms for a sense of belonging when bars, gyms and pride events were shuttered.
""These trends are here to stay,"" he added. ""Just like video conferencing and telecommuting.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) is confident about its prospects in Asia, helped by cognac and scotch whisky demand in China, the French drinks company's Asia boss said on Tuesday.
""Despite the pandemic and the many uncertainties we have to navigate through, our business is resilient, rebounding and continuing its transformation,"" Pernod Ricard Asia Chairman and Chief Executive Philippe Guettat said on a company YouTube presentation. 
Guettat confirmed during a call with analysts the group's medium-term ambition for sales growth rates of high single to low double digits for China and low double digits for India.
China and India are the group’s two largest markets after the United States, each accounting for about 10% of group sales.
In China, cognac demand was booming in night clubs and was strong in restaurants, with customers spending heavily following the COVID crisis as they were travelling less, Guettat said.
There was also strong demand for scotch whisky in China with strong double digit growth for all brands, including Chivas, Ballantines and Glenlivet. Scotch was attracting a younger crowd, aged below 30.

The South East Asia market remained difficult as the pandemic was hitting tourism and a recovery was not expected before the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, Guettat said.
Pernod said in April it expected 10% group organic profit growth for its 2020/2021 financial year after strong demand in its U.S. and Chinese markets helped the French spirits group beat third quarter sales forecasts.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank on Tuesday offered to reduce the number of job cuts by more than 1,300 from its initial plan of nearly 8,300 layoffs as thousands of employees went on a one-day strike and staged protest rallies across Spain.
It was the second such labour action in Spain's banking sector in less than three weeks after a one-day strike by BBVA (MC:BBVA) employees marked the first stoppage involving a bank at a national level in 30 years.
Following its acquisition of Bankia, Caixabank said in April it was planning to cut 8,291 jobs, one of the largest such culls in Spanish history, to adapt to a client shift towards online banking.
On Tuesday, it offered to bring that number down to 6,950, while it also improved economic compensations for those who leave the bank, Caixabank said in a statement.
Spanish union Comisiones Obreras (CCOO), the largest in the financial sector, demands that any cuts should be through voluntary redundancy while calling for greater financial compensation.
A CCOO spokesperson said on Tuesday it was still too early to give an assessment of the bank's latest offer. 
Negotiations between the bank and unions are expected to end on June 29. 
""If they fire me now, I won't find another job,"" said Noelia Anchuelo Berlinches, a 49-years-old Caixabank employee, protesting in front of Caixabank headquarters in Madrid.

""What we are asking now is to be treated with respect,"" said Anchuelo Berlinches, who started working 30 years ago at Caja Madrid, the former savings bank that became Bankia in 2010.
According to CCOO, 70% of Caixabank's 5,552 branches in Spain were shut by the strike on Tuesday although neither the bank nor CCOO said how many of its around 44,000 employees had taken part in the strike.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian pension fund KLP is divesting from Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited on the grounds the company's links with the Myanmar military breach the fund's responsible investment policy, KLP said on Tuesday.
Adani Ports, India's largest port operator, has been under scrutiny from international investors over its project to build a container terminal in the city of Yangon on land leased from a Myanmar military-owned conglomerate.
A military coup in Myanmar on Feb. 1 and an ensuing crackdown on mass protests in which hundreds have been killed has drawn international condemnation and sanctions on military figures and military-controlled entities. 
""Adani's operations in Myanmar and its business partnership with that country's armed forces constitutes an unacceptable risk of contributing to the violation of KLP's guidelines for responsible investment,"" KLP said in a statement to Reuters.
A spokesperson for the Myanmar military did not answer calls from Reuters seeking comment.
KLP, Norway's largest pension fund, had an investment worth nine million crowns ($1.05 million) in Adani Ports at the time of its decision, it told Reuters.
It was divesting because the container terminal is being built on land owned by the Myanmar military and that there is an ""imminent danger"" the armed forces could use the port to import weapons and equipment, or as a naval base.
""In this way, the port could be used by the army to continue its violations of human rights,"" KLP said.
Adani said it condemned the violence in Myanmar and the violations of the fundamental rights of its people and that, at the time the deal was concluded in 2019, its counterparties were entities of the democratically-elected government.
It reiterated it could abandon the project and write down the investment if it is found to be in violation of sanctions imposed by the United States.
""The write down will not materially affect the balance sheet as it is equivalent to about 1.3% of...total assets,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. 
KLP said it had been in a dialogue with Adani Ports since March this year and held a meeting with the company's management in April. 
Adani told KLP ""it takes human rights seriously, and that it has a human rights policy"", KLP said.
At the same time, ""Adani said it had made no due diligence assessments relating to human rights before the agreement it concluded with the Myanmar military"", KLP said.
Adani did not reply to a question about KLP's statement.
An activist group welcomed KLP's decision to divest from Adani Ports.

""We call on other pension funds to follow suit and divest from Adani Ports and other business partners of the Myanmar military,"" Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar, said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Shareholders in Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) applauded on Tuesday the French media giant's plan to spin off its $39 billion Universal music business, underpinning Vincent Bollore's grip on the group and ignoring concerns expressed by several funds. 
Bluebell Capital Partners and investment fund Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) said the transaction was unfavourable to some investors, setting the stage for what could have been a standoff between the French tycoon and some minority shareholders.
Instead, the proposal to spin-off Universal Music Group (UMG), which involves distributing 60% of Universal's shares to Vivendi shareholders, received more than 99% of the votes in favour. 
Vivendi plans to list Universal, valued at 33 billion euros ($39 billion) by its parent company, in Amsterdam in autumn. The group said Universal could make its market debut on Sept. 21.
Bollore, Vivendi's controlling shareholder with a 27% stake, would be one of the first beneficiaries of the transaction after listing the music division, which is home to artists such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.
Bluebell had expressed concerns about another resolution put to vote on Tuesday, which would allow Vivendi to buy back and cancel its shares for up to 50% of its capital. 
The fund questioned whether it could allow Bollore to increase his stake in Vivendi without making a tender offer.
Bollore's family-owned group pledged that it would not request an exemption to file a tender offer on Vivendi's shares if it crossed the 30% threshold in capital ownership.
In the end, the resolution received 73% of votes in favour.
Two major investors have already invested in Universal. 
William Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH), a special purpose acquisition vehicle, has signed a deal to buy 10% of the music business. 
Prior to this transaction, a consortium led by Chinese giant Tencent bought a 20% chunk in Universal.
Ackman's investment prompted billionaire and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) to buy a substantial stake in Vivendi to evaluate the sale of the 10% Universal stake to PSTH, a source familiar with the firm's holdings said.

""We think (the spin-off) should have been done in a different way,"" said Giuseppe Bivona, a partner at Bluebell, following Vivendi's shareholders meeting. ""But we think UMG is going to flourish much more outside the group than it has done in the past.""

Volkswagen still expects to achieve a 2021 operating profit margin of between 5.5% and 7% for the group and a margin of 3% to 4% for its main brand, a spokesperson for the company said.
""Fortunately, been we have able to notably limit the negative impact on our customers and thus on delivery figures so far, for example by selling off inventories and other measures,"" the spokesperson said.
Business Insider reported on Tuesday that the Wolfsburg-based firm did not expect to be able to produce more than 800,000 vehicles this year due to semiconductor bottlenecks.
The spokesperson declined to confirm that figure and said it was not possible to reliably forecast the impact of the semiconductor shortage on production and deliveries by the end of the year.

Volkswagen has already said the bottlenecks would lead to a six-figure number of vehicles not being produced, the spokesperson added.
The German firm said this month it expected the chips shortage to ease in the third quarter but saw the bottlenecks continuing in the long-term.

LONDON (Reuters) - Environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, widely used by asset managers to make climate-friendly investments, need tighter oversight to avoid risks to the smooth functioning of financial markets, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday.
Investors are increasingly demanding that asset managers put their cash into companies that meet ""green"" or ESG criteria, with references to ESG ratings embedded into their investment processes, the FCA said.
But the ESG ratings business, a market that could be worth $1 billion this year, has no firm definition of data provision that applies globally, the FCA said.
ESG ratings providers, which rank companies' performance based on ESG factors, have different methodology and use different ways to plug gaps in data, leading to little correlation between them, the FCA said.
Combined with other features of ESG rating provision, there may be ""potential for harm to market functioning, or to consumers, in some circumstances"", the FCA said in a consultation paper on Tuesday.
""Since ESG rating providers operate and cover companies globally, we consider that there would be a strong benefit in a globally applicable regulatory approach, rather than a local regime,"" the FCA said.
""However, global coordination can often take time and the harms may arise locally in the meantime."" 
There has been a flurry of consolidation among companies that provide ESG ratings. MSCI has acquired Innovest and KLD, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has bought Vigeo Eiris, Morningstar taken over Sustainalytics, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) completed an acquisition of RobecoSAM in January 2020 and the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) completed its acquisition of Refinitiv this year.

Policy options include guidance for firms on using ESG data and ratings, a best practice code for ESG data and rating providers, and introducing regulation of ESG data and raters, which has already been suggested by regulators in the European Union, the FCA said.
The EU's securities watchdog has said regulation is needed for raters to avoid ""greenwashing"", which refers to giving a misleading impression of green credentials.

The European Commission will assess the restrictions Google has placed on the ability of advertisers, publishers and other third parties to access data about user identity and their behavior.
“We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete in the so-called ad tech stack. . .We will also be looking at Google's policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition,” Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said in a press release.
The case is the latest in a series of probes against the online giant for allegations ranging from impinging on users’ privacy to allowing unauthorized use of copyright data.
In a separate case that brought relief to Google’s YouTube service, the European Court of Justice today held that online platforms are not liable for users uploading unauthorized works, unless the platforms failed to take quick action to remove or block access to the content.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Securities misconduct in Canada has risen sharply as perpetrators attempted to capitalize on pandemic-driven uncertainties, while social media frenzy surrounding certain stocks and cryptocurrencies also opened the door to more wrongdoing, regulators said on Tuesday.
Regulators started enforcement action against 13 individuals or companies for insider trading in the fiscal year ended March 31, versus just one in 2020; 49 parties for illegal distribution of securities, compared with 20; and against 27 respondents for misconduct, including violations of securities laws, from four the prior year, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) said in a report.
""The COVID-19 climate created opportunities for wrongdoers, and so there was a lot of work from the CSA in the spring and summer of last year to take action,"" said CSA Chair Louis Morisset.
The CSA is the umbrella group for the country's provincial and territorial securities regulators.
""You could create your own (cryptocurrency) token right away, and through social media... could advertise your token and maybe easily defraud people,"" Morisset said.
""We need to remain extremely vigilant about what’s happening; we need to rely on whistleblowers to let us know what's happening."" 
Whistleblower tips jumped to 461 from 291 a year earlier. CSA members started 52 cases compared with 38.

Of about 150 cases of fraud found in a sweep of COVID-19-related investment scams conducted by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), which represents state and provincial regulators across the continent, 64 were identified by Canadian regulators, the report said. 
Some of the Canadian actions have included public warnings and suspensions of domain names of unregistered firms offering investments and listed companies making exaggerated claims, according to the NASAA's website. Morisset attributed Canada's outsized share to regulators' success in uncovering scams.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 07:12AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. watchdog to adopt mortgage moratorium rule with some exclusions - sources,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog in coming weeks will adopt a rule requiring mortgage servicers to give struggling homeowners until next year to resume repayments, but is expected to carve out some groups of borrowers following industry pushback, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in April proposed, among other measures, a new review process that would generally prohibit mortgage servicers from starting a foreclosure until after Dec. 31, 2021. The rule will throw a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of homeowners due to exit COVID-19 mortgage holiday or ""forbearance"" programs in coming months. 
Mortgage servicers receive payments from borrowers and pass them on to investors, tax authorities and insurers. 
The CFPB plans to finalize the rule and make it effective before the end of August, but has agreed to carve out certain groups of borrowers after the industry said the proposal was too broad and beyond the CFPB's legal remit, three of sources said.
A CFPB spokesperson said the agency is working on finalizing the proposal but did not comment on what exclusions had been agreed to.
""We remain committed to working with both servicers and homeowners to prevent avoidable foreclosures to the maximum extent possible,"" the spokesperson added. 
The borrowers expected to be carved-out, which has not previously been reported, include those in the process of negotiating an arrangement with their servicer to avoid foreclosure but who have not yet applied to be put into forbearance, the same three people said.
It is also expected to exclude borrowers who may have abandoned their homes without trying to notify their servicers and those who do not respond to multiple inquiries from servicers about whether they wish to remain in their homes.
The CFPB agreed to the exemptions to limit the compliance burden for some servicers and give them more flexibility to help customers, the four sources said. They said the rule will also not apply to small servicers with limited market share that are less able to absorb the compliance costs.
The sources, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, include a regulatory official and industry lawyers and executives involved in the discussions.
""The Bureau's rules achieve two aims: mandating some additional help for struggling borrowers who have a plan to stay in their homes, while also creating clear exemptions to help servicers maintain the steady supply of homes the market demands,"" said Michael Bright, CEO of the Structured Finance Association, which represents the mortgage securitization industry and was among the groups that pushed for the exemptions. 
FORECLOSURE CRISIS
To help Americans weather pandemic lockdowns, Congress last year gave struggling homeowners the right to pause mortgage repayments and imposed a moratorium on foreclosures. 
As of June 14, an estimated 2 million homeowners were in forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Around 900,000 of those forbearance plans are due to expire later this year, industry data provider Black Knight (NYSE:BKI) estimates. 
CFPB staff are worried existing regulatory tools will not provide sufficient help for homeowners who have suffered a permanent disruption of income as a result of the pandemic. 
They hope the new rule would prevent a wave of foreclosures by raising the burden of ""reasonable effort"" a servicer makes to help struggling borrowers, one of the sources said.

At the same time, ""the agency wants to make sure struggling consumers know that they can't just put their head in the sand until December 31"" and should reach out to their servicer for help, said the regulatory official. 
""And to servicers: we're watching you, but we want to achieve the best outcomes for business and borrowers.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, consolidating after the previous session’s powerful gains, with investors looking to Fed Chair Jerome Powell for guidance after last week’s policy shift. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 10 points, less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded flat, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The main equity indices bounced strongly Monday, recouping some of last week’s Fed-inspired losses, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining nearly 600 points, or 1.8%, the broad-based S&P 500 rising 1.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 0.8%.
However, activity is likely to be limited ahead of Powell’s testimony before U.S. lawmakers in Congress, starting at 2 PM ET, as investors continue to adjust to the central bank's policy shift.
Powell is set to repeat that inflationary pressures, although more marked than previously expected, will be transitory, while expressing optimism about the outlook for the labor market.  
Ahead of his appearance, investors will study the latest existing home sales data, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will release its non-manufacturing business data and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond its monthly manufacturing survey.
In corporate news,  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) will be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported the company, the third-biggest U.S. chicken producer by processing capacity, is exploring a sale.
Additionally,  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) is due to report Tuesday, with the hydrogen fuel cell maker expected to report a loss of 8 cents a share on revenue of $72.16 million.
Crude oil prices slipped Tuesday, falling back from new highs, as traders reacted to the potential of additional supply hitting the market.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.2% at $71.03 a barrel, after surging 2.8% on Monday, while Brent was up 0.3% at $73.11, after earlier climbing above $75 a barrel for the first time since April 2019. 
The drop follows a Bloomberg report stating that Russia plans to propose an increase in crude supply at next week’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a group known as OPEC+, to counter what they see as a shortness of supply.
Both crude benchmarks have posted strong gains of over 40% this year, as successful vaccination programs have resulted in a lot of the high energy-consuming countries reopening their economies.
The American Petroleum Institute is due later Tuesday to release its latest estimates of U.S. crude oil supply data, ahead of official numbers from the Energy Information Administration the following day. They are expected to show another hefty draw, which would be a fifth weekly decline.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Aer Lingus needs a few hundred million euros in extra liquidity due to COVID-19 disruptions and does not expect the easing of Irish travel curbs next month to provide a significant near term bounce, its new chief executive said on Tuesday.
The Irish airline, which recently announced company-wide layoffs and the closure of one of its main domestic cabin crew bases, is losing more than 1 million euros ($1.19 million) a day, Lynne Embleton told an Irish parliamentary committee.
It is in funding talks with the Irish state and its parent International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), having already received a 150 million euro loan from Ireland's sovereign wealth fund last year.
""We are looking to restore our liquidity to the tune of a few hundred million euros. The precise numbers depend on where we can access liquidity from, the terms of that liquidity and indeed the number of days we continue to burn cash,"" she said. 
Embleton said the decision to close the carrier's base at Shannon Airport, one of its four main domestic hubs, did not signal a strategic retreat from Ireland's regions. But she said she could not give assurances there would be no more job losses.
Ireland's airlines have been highly critical of the government's COVID-19 travel curbs which for months have been the strictest in the European Union. 
Ireland will adopt the EU's COVID-19 certificate to help citizens move more freely across the bloc from July 19, as well as broadly applying the same approach to Britain and the United States.
""It is looking too little too late to have a significant bounce that will get us on the right path to restoring connectivity, supporting jobs in the near term,"" Embleton said, citing curbs for unvaccinated travellers from Britain and the United States.

""We will be smaller for some time to come unfortunately and it will take a long time to fully recover,"" she said.

Stephen Calk, a former chairman and chief executive of Federal Savings Bank, has pleaded not guilty to charges of financial institution bribery and conspiracy for helping arrange $16 million of loans to Manafort that later went into default.
Prosecutors said that after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Calk sent Manafort a ranked list of 10 positions he wanted, including Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and defense secretary, and a separate list of 19 ambassadorships.
Manafort allegedly recommended to Trump's post-election transition team that Calk, a 16-year Army veteran, be appointed Army secretary, the service's top civilian job.
Calk interviewed in January 2017 for a job as Under Secretary of the Army, but never joined the administration.
U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan will oversee Calk's trial.
The defendant was first charged in May 2019, and faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on the bribery charge.
Calk's alleged outreach was discussed at Manafort's 2018 trial in Virginia, including accusations that Manafort made false statements to privately held Federal Savings to obtain his loans.
That case originated with former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Manafort was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud and sentenced to 7-1/2 years in prison, but was later released to home confinement. Trump then pardoned Manafort in December.

At Manafort's trial, a Federal Savings employee testified that Calk had taken a ""personal interest"" in Manafort's loans, and that he had never seen such loans approved so fast.
The case is U.S. v. Calk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00366.

(Reuters) -British cardboard maker DS Smith expects to flourish from a sustained boom in online shopping and growing demand for recyclable packaging, it said on Tuesday as it reported a second-half recovery from an initial pandemic-induced slump.
DS Smith, which supplies packaging products to companies including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nestle, and Unilever (NYSE:UL), said adjusted operating profit in the second half of its financial year rose by more than 18% from the first half, citing rising demand, particularly in the United States.
The company expects the online shopping boom to continue even after COVID-19 lockdowns end, saying that consumers now prefer the choice and convenience it offers, and plans to tap continued growth in demand for sustainable products. 
As Europe's biggest recycler of cardboard, the London-based company has committed to manufacturing 100% recyclable packaging by 2023, it said. 
With consumers more conscious of the need to recycle packaging and the importance of alternatives to plastics, it has also upped its investment to set up box plants in Italy and Poland.
""It is our highest growth rate ever achieved. We are pleased with that growth in the COVID era,"" Chief Executive Miles Roberts, said of the company's second-half box output. 
Pretax profit for the full year to April 30 fell 38% to 231 million pounds, with the pandemic hitting operations hard in the first half.
Shares in the company were down 1.8% at 424 pence at 0956 GMT.
For the current year, the company said it expects higher packaging prices to offset increasing energy, transport and labour costs.

DS Smith also announced a final dividend of 8.1 pence, taking its total dividend for the year to 12.1 pence.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",How Reuters compared U.S. corporations' taxes with their foreign rivals,"By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - Reuters analyzed the filings of hundreds of U.S. and foreign companies to compare their tax bills, finding that the U.S. firms currently pay far lower taxes - and would likely continue to pay lower taxes under a tax hike proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden.
To identify comparable competitors among large firms, Reuters relied on the U.S. firms own assessments of their main rivals. About half of the 200 biggest firms by market capitalization in the S&P 500 published the names of their chief competitors, both domestic and foreign. Reuters then excluded all the firms that listed only domestic competitors rather than international rivals.
The news organization also excluded seven firms that posted a loss in 2020, and another three firms with tax bills far lower than was typical for the group, to prevent unrepresentative outliers from skewing the overall analysis.
That left 52 U.S. firms to analyze, who named a total of 200 foreign competitors that Reuters used for comparison. Those U.S.-based companies were all multinationals with some foreign operations, and they represented a broad cross-section of sectors, including technology, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and heavy industry sectors. Their market capitalization ranged from $40 billion to $1.9 trillion.
The average effective tax rate the U.S. firms reported was 16%, compared with an average effective rate reported by their competitors of 24%.

To assess the impact of Biden’s tax proposal on the U.S. firms, Reuters applied Biden’s proposed rates of 28% for U.S. income and the proposed minimum rate of 21% on overseas income to the companies’ 2020 earnings.
U.S. business lobbies say comparisons of effective tax rates, as in this analysis, don’t offer a complete picture of how U.S. tax policy affects the global competitiveness of U.S. firms. They also argue that any tax boost will hurt American firms.

Investing.com – Shares of  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) were up 7% in Tuesday’s premarket on reports the poultry giant is exploring a sale.
Sanderson has tapped Centerview Partners for advice on the potential sale and has attracted interest from suitors including agricultural investment firm Continental Grain, according to The Wall Street Journal report.
Mississippi-based Sanderson is the third-biggest U.S. chicken producer by processing capacity. Continental owns a smaller chicken processor.
The target company had a market value of $3.72 billion as of Monday’s close of $166.58 per share.
Demand for food items, including chicken breasts and wings, has increased as pandemic restrictions lift and restaurants reopen, boosting sales and prices. The cost of boneless, skinless chicken breast has more than doubled since the beginning of the year and wing prices have hit records, according to the WSJ report.
For the second quarter ended April 30, Sanderson’s net sales were $1.13 billion compared with $844.7 million for the same period a year ago. Net income was $96.9 million, or $4.34 per share, compared with net income of $6.1 million, or $0.28 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020."

922,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 04:46AM ET</span>",Toshiba board chair likely to scrape through with reappointment at crucial AGM - sources,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Yuki Nitta
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama is tipped to win reappointment at a pivotal shareholders' meeting this Friday - albeit by a thin margin, two people familiar with the matter said.
Nagayama has come under intense pressure to resign after an independent investigation this month found Toshiba had colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block foreign shareholders from gaining influence on the board at last year's annual general meeting.
Indications from shareholders so far have shown ""Nagayama is more likely to win than lose reappointment"", said one of the people, adding that domestic investors in general appear to be more supportive of Nagayama than foreign investors.
The sources were not authorised to speak on the matter to media and declined to be identified. Toshiba declined to comment on prospects for board nominees at this Friday's AGM.
Nagayama's supporters argue the former pharma executive and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp board director only joined Toshiba's board in mid-2020 after the alleged pressuring of foreign shareholders took place, and that without him the conglomerate will lack a steady hand to guide it through its latest crisis.
Current CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa retook the helm in April after the company's previous leader left amid controversy over a $20 billion buyout bid from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners but has said he does not plan to stay on for too long.
Both Sony and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos have expressed support for Nagayama, highlighting his track record in governance at the electronics giant.
But Nagayama's critics say he should take responsibility for Toshiba's board initially having resisted a shareholder's call for an independent probe.
Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's No. 2 shareholder with a 7.2% stake, has demanded Nagayama's immediate resignation. Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis have recommended against his reappointment.
Toshiba's foreign activist investors secured a landmark win for Japan corporate governance in March when 58% of shareholder votes at an extraordinary general meeting were counted in favour of a probe into the allegations.
But its shareholder base has changed since the conglomerate was reinstated in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's TOPIX index in late February, a move that brought in more domestic index-linked funds. While many of those passive funds were not eligible to vote in March, they now are.
Overseas investors now account for around 50% of Toshiba's shareholders compared to 63% a year ago, the company said. 
Moreover, not all overseas investors are against Nagayama.
Among votes disclosed so far, Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, and the State Board of Administration of Florida have voted against Nagayama but California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has voted for him. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has also voted for him, according to one of the sources.
BlackRock has a Toshiba stake of more than 5% according to filings. Refinitiv data shows that as of end 2020, Norges had 1.3% while as of end-June 2020, CalPERS owned 0.45%. Florida's SBA had 0.04% as of end-March last year.
As for domestic asset managers, Japan's revised stewardship code has made it more difficult for them to blindly vote for companies as has often been the case in the past, so some could vote against Nagayama, governance experts say.
""That said, it's still extremely rare at large Japanese companies, where institutional investors have large holdings, to have the reappointment of current board members rejected,"" said Shoya Okuma, chief executive of proxy advisory firm QuestHub.

Toshiba will be nominating 11 directors including Nagayama at this Friday's AGM - a truncated slate after it announced in the wake of the investigation that two members of the board's audit committee, which has been blamed for failing to properly address the allegations, would not be standing for re-election.
One nominee, Nobuyuki Kobayashi, also a member of the audit committee, is unlikely to win re-election after opposition from shareholder advisory firms, one of the sources said.

(Reuters) -Britain's Melrose Industries on Tuesday laid out plans to return about 730 million pounds ($1.01 billion) in cash to its shareholders after the company sold its Nortek Air Management business, sending its shares 3% higher. 
Melrose, which specialises in acquiring and turning around underperforming businesses before selling them on, agreed to sell Nortek in April and planned to use proceeds to pay down debt, reduce a British pension deficit and return cash.
""We have taken a conservative view for the level of the current return of capital, but if markets continue to recover, we expect to announce a further significant return next year,"" CEO Simon Peckham said. 
Melrose's current return plans equal 15 pence per existing ordinary share for shareholders, it said, adding that there were some encouraging signs for its aerospace division after the coronavirus pandemic hit it hard.
The division had squeezed out a modest profit in the first quarter compared with a loss last year, helped by cost cuts. 
London-listed Melrose, which has also warned growth would be hit by a shortage of chips in the automotive supply chain, said the group was trading in line with expectations ahead of interim results on June 30.
Shares of the company were up 1.6% at 161 pence by 0717 GMT. The stock lost nearly 26% of its value last year and is down 11% for 2021 as of Monday's close. 
Melrose said there was recovery in demand for cars and powder metals, and these divisions, including automotive, had been ""significantly"" cash generative.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, which last week defaulted on a $500 million sukuk, is considering a court supervised debt restructuring process and is in talks to slash its fleet size, company executives said on Monday.
A deputy minister of state-owned enterprises said earlier this month the state-controlled airline's total debt is about $4.5 billion and it runs a $100 million negative cashflow a month due to high costs and low revenues during the coronavirus pandemic.
Garuda, which has been seeking a suspension on payments for most liabilities, is now considering whether to negotiate its mounting debt in or out of court, Chief Executive Irfan Setiaputra told a parliamentary hearing late on Monday.
However, he noted that while bringing the matter to a commercial court could bring about a quicker agreement with creditors, there is a risk of not reaching a solution and the court could declare Garuda bankrupt.
""Garuda must have a solid plan because ... creditors must be convinced that if they sacrifice their claims, they know that Garuda will sustain for longer time,"" he told MPs in a hearing streamed online, during which sound was often muted due to the sensitive nature of the information.
The pandemic has forced the airline to shut some flights, with average passenger numbers per flight also down significantly. These included unprofitable routes such as Jakarta-Osaka, and will include flights to Melbourne and Perth next month, Irfan said. The company is also reviewing an Amsterdam flight.
The airline currently only flies 41 planes of the 142 in its fleet, Dony Oskaria, the firm's deputy chief executive officer, told the same hearing. It has returned 20 planes to lessors and is in negotiation to return seven more, he said. 
""The negotiation process is not easy. We want to return 101 planes but it will take time,"" Dony said, adding the company is currently negotiating schemes for early termination, lease holiday or pay-by-the-hour. 

Garuda also presented to parliament a five-year business plan from 2022, which includes a goal for positive EBITDA and a fleet of 66 planes. The plan assumes a turnaround period starting from the second half of this year.
The airline also wants to keep a workforce in accordance with its number of planes. Garuda employed more than 7,800 before the pandemic, but it has now terminated 2,300, according to a document submitted to MPs.

""But we already see signs of recovery,"" said Nissan's Chief Executive Officer Uchida. ""Thanks to the strong results of our ongoing efforts over the past year, Nissan's performance for April and May is better than our plan.""
The global Nissan team is ""doing everything it can"" to avoid three consecutive years of losses, Uchida said.
Nissan, like other automakers, has been making production adjustments because of a global chip supply crunch. Sources have told Reuters the company would temporarily halt production at some plants in Japan and Mexico this month.
""As we pay close attention to the market trends and adjust production of models, we are minimising the negative impact of the semiconductor supply issue on the plant utilisation rate,"" Uchida said.
He added that the company was trying to make up for the production loss within the financial year and to take action to ensure stability in its supply of parts.

Although the company is not ready to provide dividend forecasts, it will try to generate sufficient net cash and resume payments as soon as possible, Uchida said.
When a shareholder asked about a domestic media report last week that the automaker is ending the development of its Skyline sedans, Uchida said that Nissan has made no such decision.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>","Boeing lobbyist Keating, who helped steer it through MAX crisis, exits abruptly","By Eric M. Johnson, David Shepardson and Andrea Shalal
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co announced on Monday that veteran lobbyist and political strategist Tim Keating, who helped navigate the U.S. planemaker through its worst-ever crisis following fatal 737 MAX crashes, has left the company but gave no reason.
An internal memo from Chief Executive Dave Calhoun to government operations employees, and a separate statement to media, confirmed Keating's departure and the search for a permanent replacement, but offered no explanation or further details on what appeared to be an abrupt exit.
Marc Allen, Boeing's chief strategy officer, would also take over Keating's role until a permanent replacement is found, Calhoun said. 
The U.S. planemaker came under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jetliners in 2018 and 2019. The crashes plunged the company into its worst-ever crisis, one long-since compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing, said Keating had played a critical role in Boeing's effort to manage a series of crises, including the 737 MAX saga, the loss of a major defense contract, and the sharp erosion of revenue caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Keating might not have stayed at Boeing as long as he did except out of a sense of responsibility because the company was in dire straits,"" Thompson said. 
The news was first reported by Defense One. 
Neither Calhoun nor Boeing's media statement offered Keating thanks or acknowledged his contributions to the company, which included running its extensive philanthropic activities - unusual omissions that raised questions about the circumstances of his departure.
Boeing also removed Keating's profile from its website.
A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment beyond its media statement. 
Keating is a forceful Washington insider whose deep knowledge of congressional process and politics helped him push through numerous campaigns since joining Boeing in 2008.
For years, he fought to keep selling the Navy more F/A-18 Super Hornets, even as the Navy, Marines and Air Force increased their orders of a new fighter jet built by U.S. defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). 
He lobbied to convince U.S. lawmakers to overturn the Air Force's award of a major contract to Boeing rival Airbus to build refueling tankers and redo the competition. 
Boeing ultimately won the deal, but its work on the KC-46A tanker has been plagued by costly delays and other setbacks.

Before Boeing, Keating was senior vice president of global government relations at Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), and chairman of the board at Washington lobbying firm Timmons and Company. 
Earlier, Keating served in different White House roles under former President Bill Clinton.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A small Texas investor who caused shares of a real estate investment trust to plunge 39 percent in a day has agreed to pay the company restitution to settle a lawsuit against him, a rare development that could embolden other companies to pursue such claims. 
Quinton Mathews, who published his research on companies online under the pseudonym Rota Fortunae, will pay Farmland (NYSE:FPI) Partners Inc ""a multiple"" of the profits on his short bet in 2018, according to the terms of the legal settlement announced https://twitter.com/RFortunae/status/1406807986232770562/photo/1 late Sunday. His research had helped wipe as much as $115 million off Farmland's market value.
The parties declined requests for comment on the exact value of the settlement.
Mathews conceded that ""many of the key statements"" in a report https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186457-farmland-partners-loans-to-related-party-tenants-introduce-significant-risk-of-insolvency he published on website Seeking Alpha targeting Farmland - including allegations of dubious related-party transactions and the risk of insolvency - were wrong.
""I regret any harm the article and its inaccuracies caused,"" Mathews said in the announcement, which was posted on Twitter and Seeking Alpha.
Paul Pittman, Farmland's chief executive officer, said in a statement that ""investors already recognize that the company was the victim of a short and distort scheme."" 
Farmland shares traded around $12.50 on Monday afternoon, up from around $5 after the short campaign. The company has produced trailing total returns of 12.5% over the last three years, about 10 percentage points lower than the specialty REIT sector, according to a Morningstar tracker. 
Jacob Frenkel, an attorney with Dickinson Wright who has defended companies against allegations of stock manipulation and was not involved in the Farmland case, said Mathews' apology and payment could build company confidence to pursue similar claims against short sellers. 
""It's highly unusual and refreshing to see a company take on this fight, because most will take the short term blow of the attack without pursuing legal vindication,"" Frenkel said.
George Moriarty, the former executive editor of Seeking Alpha, told Reuters in 2019 that courts had respected the website’s status as a neutral platform, and that its staff vetted all posts (Read more https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-shorts-insight/short-distort-the-ugly-war-between-ceos-and-activist-critics-idUSKCN1R20AW). 
After the retraction, Seeking Alpha on Monday took down all articles by Mathews, including the original post on Farmland, and blocked his account, according to website representative Abby Estikangi-Carmel.
Seeking Alpha's policies include author certification that they were not paid to post and, for short reports, that the assertion was run by the target company.
""Regardless of the steps you take, a bad actor may decide to defraud us by violating our policies, as evidently happened here,"" Estikangi-Carmel said. ""Thankfully, it appears to be an isolated incident.""

Mathews runs a one-person investigative research business, Dallas area-based QKM LLC, and has published more than a dozen articles on Seeking Alpha. 
Farmland's litigation against a hedge fund firm that paid Mathews for research, Sabrepoint Capital Management LP, continues. Sabrepoint founder George Baxter (NYSE:BAX) said his firm had nothing to do with the Seeking Alpha article and that it would ""defend itself and its employees vigorously against Farmland's frivolous claims.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Starlink, the satellite internet unit of Elon Musk's SpaceX, expects to be able to provide continuous global coverage by around September but will then need to seek regulatory approvals, its president Gwynne Shotwel said on Tuesday.
""We've successfully deployed 1,800 or so satellites and once all those satellites reach their operational orbit, we will have continuous global coverage, so that should be like September timeframe,"" she told a Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) technology conference via webcast.
""But then we have regulatory work to go into every country and get approved to provide telecoms services.""
Starlink, which has said it plans to deploy 12,000 satellites in total at a cost of roughly $10 billion, currently offers beta services in 11 countries, Shotwel said.
In May, Musk said the low-Earth orbiting satellite network had received more than 500,000 preorders for its internet service and anticipates no technical problems meeting demand.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission this year approved SpaceX's plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.
Starlink is one of a growing number of makers of small satellites that also includes Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kuiper, Britain's OneWeb, venture capital-backed Planet, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Blue Canyon Technologies.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Tuesday morning, following a rebound in U.S. counterparts during the previous session. The possibility that policy tightening could be more gradual than expected allayed fears over the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest hawkish tilt.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 225 soared 3.03% by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.69%
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.41%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.01%. China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.76% while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.19%.
The S&P 500 rallied the most in five weeks during the previous session. The benchmark index even outperformed the Nasdaq 100, with a revival of the value trade in sectors like energy and financial also giving U.S. shares a boost.
Yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rebounded during the previous session, even as short-end rates remained firmly in place. The rebound helped unravel some of the curve-flattening that took place after the Fed handed down its policy decision during the previous week, which hinted at earlier-than-expected interest rate hikes and asset tapering.
Investors also continue to assess the outlook as the focus remains squarely on inflation and the risks posed to the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged in written remarks that there was a pickup in inflation. However, he also predicted that inflation would move back toward the central bank’s 2% target once supply imbalances are resolved.
Powell will also testify before a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on the Fed’s pandemic emergency lending and its asset purchase programs later in the day.
Other Fed voices also chimed in, with New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) reiterating his boss' viewpoint that the recent spike in inflation is a temporary phenomenon.
However, Williams’ counterpart in Dallas Robert Kaplan favored starting the process of reducing bond purchases “sooner rather than later,” echoing St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s comment that it is “appropriate” for the Fed to begin asset tapering.
“The bigger picture is that the Fed is just beginning to adjust its policy stance... the overall level of rates and liquidity should stay supportive for markets, but maybe less so than has been the case over the last year,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer for core investments Chris Iggo said in a note.
Other investors remained cautiously optimistic.
“There’s probably going to be some back and forth here... there is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now. Some of that is going to be earmarked to go into the markets, and we think the best place right now to be investing is in the equity markets,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Bloomberg.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England will hand down its own policy decision on Thursday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's lower house of Congress on Monday approved a bill allowing the privatization of state-controlled energy company Eletrobras, sending the measure to President Jair Bolsonaro for his signature.
The government-proposed bill would privatize Latin America's biggest power utility, known formally as Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, by floating shares on the stock market, with the state relinquishing control by diluting its 61% stake. 
The Bolsonaro administration expects to raise about 25 billion reais ($5 billion) from the share sale. The proceeds will go to the Treasury to pay for the renewal of concessions for Eletrobras hydroelectric plants and transmission lines.
The government will retain a golden share to veto hostile takeovers and other strategic threats. 
The privatization bill passed by a vote of 258 votes in favor, 136 opposed and five abstentions. 
The privatization of Eletrobras met with opposition from politicians, mainly on the left. 
To win support among lawmakers, Congress added provisions including the mandatory commission of gas-fired thermoelectric plants in key regions, which critics said would push up electricity prices.
The bill, which was passed by the Senate on Thursday, would increase the thermal gas plant requirement to 8,000 MW from 6,000 MW. But senators rejected an amendment extending subsidies for coal-fired power generation. The plants would be built under 30-year private concessions.
Eletrobras will be privatized at a time when Brazil is facing the threat of electricity rationing due to the worst drought in nearly a century. Thermoelectric plants are working at capacity generating more expensive power.
Critics of the privatization bill said it would lead to more costly electricity.
Even though they back the privatization of Eletrobras, large industrial consumers represented by ABRACE opposed the changes made to the bill in Congress and said the power sector would be better off without it because it would reduce competitiveness and deter investment.

ABRACE estimated that the bill passed by Congress would cost consumers 56 billion reais, half of that going to building gas-powered plants in places where there is no natural gas, not counting regional incentives and taxes.

(Reuters) - Quanergy Systems Inc, a supplier of self-driving car technology, is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with Chinese blank-check acquisition firm CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Quanergy would be the latest company developing LiDAR technology - which uses laser beams to help generate a three-dimensional map of the road - to turn to a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to go public. 
Others that have done so include Peter Thiel-backed Luminar Technologies Inc and AEye. 
The SPAC deal would value Quanergy at $1.1 billion and could be announced as early as this week, the sources said. 
The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Quanergy and CITIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CCAC raised around $240 million in an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2020. It is sponsored by CITIC Capital Holdings Limited, which is backed by CITIC Group, China’s largest investment conglomerate. 
The company was preparing to file for clearance of the deal with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a national security panel that scrutinizes foreign investment, according to one of the sources. 
Quanergy expects CFIUS would greenlight the deal because CITIC would keep its stake in the company below 10%, and Quanergy was not engaged in the recording of any personal driver data, the source added. 
No Quanergy shareholder would sell shares in the deal. Net cash proceeds held by the combined company were estimated to be about $278 million, according to the sources. They would be used to fund its operational growth and for general corporate purposes. 
Quanergy shareholders would own about 72% of the combined company, while SPAC shareholders would own around 20%, with most of the remainder going to outside investors.
Founded in 2012, Quanergy is based in Sunnyvale, California. The company has said it is the only major LiDAR provider to use Optical Phased Array technology, which reduces movable parts and therefore is better for the requirements of the automotive industry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a probe into last year's SolarWinds cyber breach, focusing on whether some companies failed to disclose that they had been affected by the unprecedented hack, two persons familiar with the investigation said on Monday.
The SEC sent investigative letters late last week to a number of public issuers and investment firms seeking voluntary information on whether they had been victims of the hack and failed to disclose it, said the persons, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential investigations.
The agency is also seeking information on whether public companies that had been victims had experienced a lapse of internal controls, and related information on insider trading. 
The agency is also looking at the policies at certain companies to assess whether they are designed to protect customer information, one of the people said.
The SEC's press office declined to comment.
A spokesperson for SolarWinds, which provides a range of IT software, networks and systems, said in a statement: ""Our top priority since learning of this unprecedented attack by a foreign government has been working closely with our customers to understand what occurred and remedy any issues.""
The company was also ""collaborating with government agencies in a transparent way,"" the statement said.
U.S. securities law requires companies to disclose material information that could affect their share prices, including cyber breaches, although cyber security disclosure failures are still relatively new enforcement territory for the SEC. 
In December, U.S. regulators found that a breach by a foreign actor of SolarWinds' software gave hackers access to data of thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. News of the hack sent SolarWinds' share price tumbling, while cyber security stocks rallied.
The United States and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the hack, which compromised nine U.S. federal agencies and hundreds of U.S. private sector companies.

If the issuers and investment firms respond to the letters by disclosing details about the breaches, they would not be subject to enforcement actions related to historical failures, including internal accounting control failures, the people said. 
While the letters are focused on the SolarWinds breach, the SEC may develop future policies on the impact of cyber security issues on the markets and on investors, the people said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India proposed banning flash sales on e-commerce websites and said on Monday their affiliate entities should not be listed as sellers on their platforms, in a proposed tightening of rules that could hit Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart. 
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs' rules, which were released in a government statement, come amid complaints by brick-and-mortar retailers that foreign e-commerce players bypass Indian laws by using complex business structures.
Amazon and Flipkart say they comply with all Indian laws. Amazon said on Monday it was reviewing the draft rules and had no immediate comment, while Walmart's Flipkart did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Under the stricter proposals, e-commerce companies should not hold flash sales in India. These are hugely popular during festive season, but have faced anger among offline sellers who say they cannot compete with the deep discounts online.
E-commerce firms must also ensure that none of their ""related parties and associated enterprises"" are listed as sellers on their shopping websites, and no related entity should sell goods to an online seller operating on the same platform.
The changes could impact business structures used by Flipkart and Amazon in the fast growing Indian e-commerce market, industry sources and lawyers said.
A Reuters investigation http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W in February showed Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers for years. Amazon holds an indirect stake in two of the top sellers on its website, but says it does not give any preferential treatment.
Foreign e-commerce players must not make direct sales to consumers, and can only operate a marketplace for sellers.
Amazon and Flipkart are also regulated under India's foreign investment rules for e-commerce, and it was not clear if the proposed consumer ministry rules will supersede them or not.
The proposal, which is applicable to both Indian and foreign players, is open for public consultation until July 6, the Indian government statement said.
The rules also call on companies to make suggestions of alternative products before customers make purchases ""to ensure a fair opportunity for domestic goods.""

""This proposal basically changes the way e-commerce is structured. This is way beyond consumer rules - this is basically like an e-commerce industry policy,"" one e-commerce executive said, adding: ""It will be extremely disruptive.""
Amazon and Flipkart are separately locked in a court battle with federal antitrust watchdog to stall an investigation into their business practices.

HOUSTON/BENGALURU (Reuters) -Top U.S. oil producer  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) has kicked off a yearly performance review for U.S. staff, a process some workers dread because they view it this year as a prelude to stealth layoffs.
The evaluations are expected to assign about 5% to 10% of the workforce to performance improvement plans that can lead to forced departures for those unable to achieve managers' goals, according to a person familiar with the process. 
Exxon last year targeted 8% of U.S. employees as low performers - up from 3% historically. 
The assessments are expected to continue into July and have been a mainstay ""for several years"" and are ""entirely unrelated to any workforce reduction plans,"" spokesperson Casey Norton said.
This year's reviews are expected to rank at least 5% of its U.S. research and engineering employees at the lowest performance tier, according to internal Exxon documents seen by Reuters. 
U.S. employees who land in the bottom tier can survive the cut by improving their performance. The company estimated 60% of those that are low-ranked will leave, according to the documents.
The evaluations come at a time Exxon is revamping operations to fit into a sharply reduced capital spending budget. An activist hedge fund that proposed to cut expenditures and improve returns won a quarter of board seats last month.
Exxon had around 72,000 regular employees as of end-2020. It last year disclosed plans to reduce its global workforce by 14,000 by the end of 2021. 

Exxon's historic $22.4 billion loss last year led the company to slash project spending by a third and delay major expansion programs. At the same time, it added $21 billion to debt to help preserve its shareholder dividend. 
Employee benefits like contributions to retirement plans also were axed last fall, though Chief Executive Darren Woods has told employees the company expects to restore them in the future.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities on Monday extended the deadline for the union at a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plant to do over a disputed contract vote that has drawn U.S. scrutiny, warning the plant's collective contract would be terminated if the date is missed.
The union at the plant in the central city of Silao must hold the vote before Aug. 20, the Labor Ministry said in a statement. The plant employs about 6,000 people.
The original union-led vote in April, in which workers voted on whether to keep their current contract, was scrapped halfway through after Mexican officials detected ""serious irregularities"" including destroyed ballots.
Concerns over potential meddling in the vote prompted the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to make the first-ever request for a review of potential labor violations under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
The trade pact that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement was designed to uphold the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and was bolstered by Mexico's 2019 labor reform. 
The law requires contract ratification votes nationwide to ensure workers are not bound to contracts that were signed behind their backs between companies and unions. 
Many traditional unions in Mexico are accused by activists of putting business interests over worker rights.
Mexico's Labor Ministry on May 11 had ordered the GM union to hold a new vote within 30 days. 
After the deadline passed, the AFL-CIO U.S. labor federation said it was ""deeply concerned"" over the delays, and U.S. lawmakers urged GM to ensure it would comply with USMCA requirements. 
GM said in a statement it would ""do everything we can to support the process,"" including cooperating with the Mexican government and allowing authorized independent observers to monitor the vote. The company reiterated that it condemns labor rights violations.
The deadline was pushed back at the union's request to ensure there would be no logistical ""impediments"" for the majority of workers to participate, the ministry said.
GM workers in Silao are represented by the Miguel Trujillo Lopez union, which is affiliated with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), one of Mexico's largest and oldest labor organizations.
Tereso Medina, head of the Miguel Trujillo Lopez union, said the request to push back the date stemmed from ""an issue of responsibility"" to ensure all workers can vote, as General Motors grapples with a global semiconductor chips shortage that has forced some pauses in production. 

He added his union would not miss the Aug. 20 deadline.
The office of the USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Delta expects U.S. leisure travel volume this month to return to pre-pandemic levels and is seeing more business travelers return to the skies, Chief of Operations John Laughter wrote to operations employees. 
On Sunday, the U.S. screened 2.1 million air travelers -- the highest number since March 2020 when COVID-19 slashed demand but still down 23% from pre-pandemic levels. Airlines are preparing for more travelers.
After heavy losses in 2020, Delta has said it expects to generate a pre-tax profit in the second half of 2021, with a re-opening of corporate America by Labor Day in early September. 
""The fact that we expect to record a profit in June - just 15 months after the sharpest decline in aviation history - is remarkable,"" Laughter said in his employee note. 
He sounded a note of caution on the timing for building back its international network, however, but cited ""welcome openings in markets like Spain, France, Italy and Greece.""
The Atlanta-based carrier anticipates travel restrictions easing across the Atlantic in the second half of 2021, Laughter added.

The 9-0 ruling https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-512_gfbh.pdf put the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) further on the defensive as it struggles to preserve a business model - huge revenues generated by college sports and big salaries for executives and coaches while players remain unpaid - under assault on multiple fronts.
The NCAA's curbs on non-cash payments to college athletes related to education - including benefits such as computers, science equipment and musical instruments - were part of what critics have called the fiction of amateurism in college sports, an enterprise that rakes in billions of dollars annually.
These limits, according to the ruling authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, are anticompetitive under a federal law called the Sherman Antitrust Act. The ruling could pave the way for challenges to other NCAA compensation rules, a prospect that Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared to invite in a separate opinion agreeing with Gorsuch.
Kavanaugh wrote that those other limits on compensation for players ""also raise serious questions under the antitrust laws"" and suggested they likely would be struck down if lower courts follow the analysis laid out in Monday's ruling.
""The NCAA is not above the law,"" Kavanaugh added.
Although the case did not involve direct payments to athletes, the wider issue of compensation for players - also including the ability to profit off their name, image and likeness - has increasingly become a point of contention.
Several states including California have passed new laws letting students profit from their name, image and likeness rights, known as NIL. The U.S. Congress is also considering legislation on the issue.
The college athletes who filed lawsuits in 2014 and 2015 - consolidated into a single case in California federal court - argued that the NCAA's compensation limits represented a form of unlawful restraint of trade. The lead plaintiff was Shawne Alston https://wvusports.com/sports/football/roster/shawne-alston/6959, who played running back for West Virginia University's football team.
'REASONABLE RULES'
The NCAA said in a statement that the ruling gives it leeway to adopt ""reasonable rules"" and it can still decide the scope of what can be defined as an educational benefit.
""Even though the decision does not directly address name, image and likeness, the NCAA remains committed to supporting NIL benefits for student-athletes,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert added. 
Gorsuch noted the huge salaries drawn by the leaders of college sports.
""Those who run this enterprise profit in a different way than the student-athletes whose activities they oversee. The president of the NCAA earns nearly $4 million per year,"" Gorsuch wrote.
Gorsuch added that commissioners of the leading collegiate conferences take home between $2 to $5 million annually, college athletic directors average more than $1 million annually and top football coaches can earn nearly $11 million a year.
It is not the role of judges to decide what college sports reforms are needed, Gorsuch said, but a ruling earlier in the litigation by California-based U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken allowing education-related compensation ""may encourage scholastic achievement and allow student-athletes a measure of compensation more consistent with the value they bring to their schools.""
Gorsuch conceded that ""some will see this as a poor substitute for fuller relief.""
Kavanaugh added, ""The bottom line is that the NCAA and its member colleges are suppressing the pay of student athletes who collectively generate billions of dollars in revenues for colleges every year. Those enormous sums of money flow to seemingly everyone except the student athletes.""
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the ruling reflects that college athletes should not be exploited.
Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer representing the players, said he hopes the ruling will ""swing the doors open to further change, so that we can finally see a fair and competitive compensation system in which these incredible players get to benefit from the economic fruits of their labors and pursue their educational objectives.""
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year deemed the NCAA's rules anticompetitive. 
University at Buffalo School of Law professor Helen Drew, who specializes in sports law, said the NCAA has been slow to react to increasing demands for reform.

The case involved student-athletes who played in the highest level of college sports: NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball and those in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Football and basketball represent the major revenue-generating collegiate sports.
Joining the NCAA in defending the compensation limits were major college sports conferences including all of the big-money so-called Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12 Conference and Pac-12 Conference.

The NRC said its team will focus on the electrical cable raceway system, which is designed to prevent a single event from disabling redundant safety-related equipment. Southern's Georgia Power said NRC staff indicated that the special inspection would focus on the company's construction remediation work related to electrical commodity installations.
Southern has said the two units under construction at Vogtle, which are billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, were on track to enter service next year with Unit 3 in the first quarter of 2022 and Unit 4 by its regulatory-approved in service date of November 2022.
The NRC said the remediation work on the electrical cable raceway system did not cause any risk to the public since there was no fuel in the plant.
Vogtle 3 will be the first new reactor in the United States since 2016. The two units at Vogtle are the only U.S. reactors under construction.
Delays and cost overruns in building reactors could make it difficult for new nuclear to play much of a role in President Joe Biden's goal of getting all U.S. power from non-carbon-emitting sources like nuclear and renewables by 2035.
When Georgia approved the Vogtle expansion in 2009, the two 1,117-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were expected to cost about $14 billion and enter service in 2016 and 2017.
Some analysts estimate costs have ballooned to more than $27 billion due to delays related to a nuclear accident at Japan's Fukushima plant in 2011 and the 2017 bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the project's former contractor.
Southern now estimates the capital cost for its 45.7% share of the new Vogtle reactors at about $8.8 billion.

An arbitration court in the Netherlands on Monday ruled that Grandvision had breached obligations of the takeover agreement, which meant that EssiLux was no longer bound to the pact. 
EssilorLuxottica, French-Italian maker of Ray-Ban sunglasses, in a statement said it welcomed the decision.
""EssilorLuxottica is reviewing its options in relation to the transaction and in due course will communicate its determination on the way forward.""
The ruling followed two earlier losses for EssiLux in a Dutch court case in which it had said that decisions made by Grandvision during the COVID-19 pandemic could give grounds for ending its proposed takeover.
It said its takeover target had breached agreements by suspending payments to store owners and suppliers and by applying for state aid, without seeking EssiLux's approval.
Grandvision at the time accused its buyer of simply looking for a way out of the deal, and on Monday said it was disappointed by the arbitration court's ruling.

If the deal does not go ahead it would bring an end to Essilux's ambition to control the Dutch eyewear group's more than 7,000 outlets worldwide.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told members of the UAW union during a visit to Flint, Michigan, that the Biden administration would work to implement trade policies that lifted wages and expanded opportunity for workers everywhere.
""At USTR we want to encourage a race to the top with higher standards and real, rapid enforcement of our trade agreements,"" she said. ""We don’t want to create incentives for companies to move jobs overseas to maximize profits.""
Tai told the autoworkers the U.S. government's decision to initiate a case against the GM facility reflected the Biden administration's determination to fully enforce labor standards negotiated under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
""We know that protection unions in Mexico don’t actually represent the workers. When workers are denied independent union representation, it is easier to suppress wages,"" she said. 
The case, the first brought under the Rapid Response Labor Mechanism in USMCA, could lead to tariffs on some of GM's most profitable vehicles under the North American trade deal.

Tai, the former top trade lawyer on the House Ways and Means Committee, helped negotiate the labor enforcement mechanism on behalf of Democrats in the U.S. Congress.
Tai and Democratic U.S. Representative Dan Kildee met with workers at UAW Local 598 in Flint, before touring a mobile COVID-19 vaccination site and encouraging people to get vaccinated.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street rebounded on Monday and global stocks rose from a four-week low as investors banked on economic growth, while the U.S. dollar sank from Friday's 10-week high, boosting oil prices.
Yields on 10-year Treasuries reversed earlier losses after sliding to a four-month low of 1.354%. The benchmark note was still trading well below its recent mid-point range of about 1.6% after traders reacted to Federal Reserve expectations for a rate hike.
Shares of banks, energy firms and other companies that tend to be sensitive to the economy's fluctuations recovered after having fallen sharply since the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank caught investors off guard by anticipating two quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2023.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged, recovering from Friday's rout as it notching its strongest session in over three months to end 1.76% higher. The S&P 500 jumped 1.40% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.79%. (N)
""Inflation is not running out of control and in fact we think economic growth will come in better than expected,"" said Monica DiCenso, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. 
""If so, this suggests that equity multiples could be lower than people think and therefore we shouldn’t be scared about even adding to equities at these levels both in the United States and overseas.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.70% and MSCI's All Country World Index was up 0.72%, recovering some of Friday's losses after touching its lowest since May 24 earlier in the session.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.79%. 
Earlier in the session, Asia shares were under pressure. Japan's Nikkei led the declines with an over 3% drop, dipping below 28,000 for the first time in a month. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1%. 
While last week's Fed meeting took the focus, the message from G-7 leaders warranted investor attention, said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings Investment Institute. 
    ""The consensus at the G-7 leaders meeting (was) the world's richest economies will continue to spend, spend, spend on renewing infrastructure, on redressing inequality and on fighting climate change,"" Smart said.
The early debate over how the Federal Reserve could begin to withdraw some of its massive support for the economy was on display on Monday when two U.S. central bank officials discussed how the playbook used after the 2007-2009 recession may not apply this time.
The U.S. dollar index fell 0.427%, off Friday's high of 92.408, as investors weighed whether the Fed's stance will mean a pause in the greenback's bear trend.
Several Fed officials have speaking duties this week, including Chair Jerome Powell, who testifies before Congress on Tuesday. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks before the European Parliament on Monday.
""We believe there is a limit to how much more hawkish the Fed can be given its inflation projections relative to the catch-up rates range,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) analysts said in a note.
""Our bottom line: We believe the Fed’s new outlook will not translate into significantly higher policy rates any time soon."" 
The euro rose 0.47%.
Sterling recovered some ground, to trade up 1% after sliding to its lowest since April 16. [GBP/]
A stronger dollar has pressured cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling over 8.11%, while smaller rival ether lost 13.11%.
Forecasts for Brazilian growth, inflation and interest rates in 2021 rose to new highs, a survey of economists showed on Monday, following the central bank's third rate hike last week.
In commodities, crude oil rose amid a pause in talks to end U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude and a weaker dollar. Declines in the greenback's value make dollar-traded commodities less expensive to holders of other currencies. [O/R]
Brent crude futures traded at $74.89, up 1.88% on the day, as U.S. crude rose 2.65% to $73.54.

Spot gold added 1.1% to trade at $1,782.80 an ounce, looking to snap a six-day losing streak, even as prices remained near their lowest since early May. 
Copper steadied on Monday, up from its lowest level since mid-April, after moves by China to rein in commodities price rallies and the hawkish signals from the Fed. [MET/L]

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholders approved the $155 million pay package for Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) Chief Executive Robert Kotick on Monday by a 54% margin, after the company took the rare move of delaying its vote on executive compensation by a week.
The maker of popular video games including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Call of Duty"" faced a campaign from an investor group against its CEO's payout, saying that the company had not addressed its concerns from prior years. 
The investors criticized Activision Blizzard for extending Kotick's employment contract through 2023, a time period that they say is too short to meaningfully reduce his pay. Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) had also recommended against Kotick's pay, calling it ""outsized.""
The vote on Kotick's pay was originally scheduled for June 14, but the company delayed it to allow investors to fully review changes it made to his compensation. Activision Blizzard said it reduced the maximum possible payout for one of Kotick's stock awards by 40%, increased the amount of shares he must hold and capped other bonuses. 
""The additional time shareholders requested allowed them to thoroughly review the facts about Activision Blizzard’s rigorous pay-for-performance compensation practices,"" the company said in a statement.
Activision Blizzard also said its stock performance has been ""exceptional."" Executive pay typically is linked to how well a company performs. 

Most companies notch support from nearly all of their investors on their pay. Those that receive low support have said they will make changes to their pay structures, such as drug distributor  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH).
""Activision will be expected to make even further changes in response to a vote where 46% of shareholders expressed discontent,"" said Michael Varner, director of executive compensation research at CtW Investment Group, a union-affiliated fund that led the campaign against Kotick's pay. ""They will not be able to ‘rest on their laurels’ solely with the changes they made thus far.""

(Reuters) -The White House laid out a plan on Monday to share 55 million U.S. COVID-19 vaccine doses globally, with roughly 75% of the doses allocated to Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa through the COVAX international vaccine-sharing program.
The plan fulfills President Joe Biden's commitment to share 80 million U.S.-made vaccines with countries around the world. The president sketched out his priorities for the first 25 million doses from that pledge earlier this month. 
The United States has come under pressure to share more of its vaccine supply with countries that are still struggling with the deadly virus and its variants. With more and more Americans getting the shots, the White House increasingly has turned its attention to getting vaccine out internationally. (Graphic on global vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/3tUM8ta
Of the 55 million remaining doses, some 41 million will be shared through COVAX, the White House said, with approximately 14 million going to Latin America and the Caribbean, some 16 million to Asia, and roughly 10 million to Africa.
The other 25%, or roughly 14 million doses, will be shared with ""regional priorities,"" including Colombia, Argentina, Iraq, Ukraine, the West Bank and Gaza.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States had faced logistical issues getting vaccine to other nations.
""We have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a Herculean logistical challenge,"" she told reporters, noting safety and regulatory information had to be shared, proper storage temperatures for the vaccines had to be ensured, and language barriers at times had to be overcome.
""We have announced today where these doses are going. We will continue to announce as they land on the ground and as they are being shipped, and we're looking forward to doing that as quickly as possible,"" she said.
The 55 million doses will be taken from the U.S. supply of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shots, though if AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine gets a green light from the Food and Drug Administration, it would likely be added to the mix as well.
The White House said it wanted the doses to be prioritized for health care workers and those who are most at risk.
International partners are eager to get U.S. help. Biden has announced the United States will buy 500 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and donate them to the world's poorest countries. 
The White House's breakdown of its allocation of the 55 million vaccine doses is below.
THROUGH COVAX:
* Latin America and the Caribbean (approximately 14 million shots): Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Costa Rica
* Asia (approximately 16 million shots): India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Cambodia, and the Pacific Islands.

* Africa (approximately 10 million shots): Recipient countries will be selected in coordination with the African Union.
THROUGH DIRECT SHARING: Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, other CARICOM countries, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, Oman, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Georgia, Moldova, and Bosnia.

Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains Monday as a sea of green swept across cyclicals and value corners of the market amid a rebound in risk appetite following last week's rout.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.8%, or 586 points, the S&P 500 rose 1.4%, the and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.79%.
Energy led the broader market higher, up 4% as investors continued to bet on higher oil demand, while the prospect of the return of Iranian supply was pushed out further after Ebrahim Raisi won the country’s presidential election.
Raisi told reporters that Iran wouldn't “negotiate for the sake of negotiations” and ruled out any meeting with President Joe Biden. 
Banking stocks were also among the top gainers, underpinning an advance in the broader financials after a slump last week as U.S. yields rebounded from lows. The United States 10-Year traded near 1.5% after falling as low as 1.35% intraday.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) were up more than 1%, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) jumped nearly 4%.
The move higher in value stocks didn't serve up the rotation away from growth as technology also participated in the broader market melt up.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were above the flatline, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the red.
The positive swing in investor sentiment on stocks followed the worst week for the broader market since October as the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt spooked investors. Remarks on Monday, however, continued to show the divide on how soon the Fed should start tightening policy. 
New York Federal Reserve official John Williams (NYSE:WMB), a Fed dove, said Monday it was too soon for the central bank to start tightening policy despite the stronger recovery. ""[T]he data and conditions have not progressed enough for the Federal Open Market Committee to shift its monetary policy stance of strong support for the economic recovery,"" he added. 
That paled in comparison to St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard's remarks Friday. “I put us starting in late 2022,”  St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC. ""[M]y forecast said 3% inflation in 2021 -- core PCE inflation -- and 2.5% core PCE inflation in 2022.""
But while the expectations for tighter monetary policy measures will weigh on valuations in 2022, companies are expected to generate sufficient earnings to drive the broader market higher.
""We expect earnings to drive returns in 2022. We estimate that earnings per share in the S&P 500 Index will increase to $220 in 2022, though rising interest rates could put downward pressure on price/earnings ratios in 2022,"" Wells Fargo said in a note.
""Our year-end median price target for the S&P 500 Index is 4,900,"" it added. That estimated price target represents about 14% upside from current levels.

The Italian group is the world's biggest listed renewable energy company measured by installed capacity and has plans to spend 150 billion euros ($178.76 billion) of its own money to nearly triple its owned capacity to 120 gigawatts and cut carbon emissions by 80% through 2030.
In an interview for the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference, Starace said that while it would be possible to fund a more aggressive transition plan, capacity constraints would make it harder to grow any faster.
""The real limit is people... and shortages of raw materials,"" he said. ""How many people can you put together and train... to do this properly, motivating and retaining them all?""
Strong growth as the global economy recovers from the pandemic has caused supply bottlenecks for some raw materials as well as for specialist equipment for the renewables industry, he said.
""Today if you want wind turbines for 2022 delivery you won't find any, perhaps for 2024,"" he said.
In May the International Energy Agency warned there was a looming mismatch between global net-zero carbon emissions targets and the availability of critical minerals such as lithium, copper and cobalt needed to develop power grids, wind turbines and power storage systems.
Enel typically buys materials two to three years forward and bought in more when COVID first hit to hedge against supply chain disruptions, Starace said, so the company was not impacted for now.
""But if it takes longer (for the supply chain) to adjust then yes it might impact,"" he said.
The pandemic provided a window into the future in as much as grids in many countries relied more on renewable power than they had previously, he said. Advocates of coal and gas power have argued that solar and wind energy depend on fickle weather and that fossil fuels are needed to guarantee supplies.
COVID changed that as power systems absorbed more wind and solar supply without crashing.
""It was like living three years in one,"" he said. ""We know that future is safe and we know we can live there pretty well.""
The United States, Europe and Latin America were key focus areas for Enel, Starace said. Southeast Asia and India would be future growth markets, he said.
Asked what governments could do to enable the transition, he said they needed to focus on deploying the technologies at hand rather than wasting time and money on developing what is so far unproven.
""Don't do science fiction movies all the time,"" he said. ""Think of what technologies we have right now and push them hard.""

959,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 03:57PM ET</span>",Big U.S. retailers line up deals to take on Amazon Prime Day frenzy,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will face challenges from big retailers during its annual Prime Day promotion, as more merchants piggyback on the multibillion-dollar online sales event.
 Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) Inc are some top American retail chains offering big discounts and promotions to coincide with Prime day, which takes place on Monday and Tuesday this year.
The two-day sales event, which generated https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/amazon-prime-day-data $10.4 billion in gross merchandise sales for Amazon last year, is taking place earlier than its traditional July run date, as the e-commerce giant looks https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/heres-why-amazon-is-moving-its-prime-day-event-earlier-in-the-summer.html to boost spending in what are historically slow sales days in the quarter.
And retailers are not missing the opportunity to get a slice of that pie. 
Department store chain Macy's is teasing customers with an ""Epic Specials"" event for two days starting Monday, while rival Kohl's is promoting cashbacks and discounts on beauty, apparel and household goods through its Prime-day coinciding event called ""Wow Deals.""
Target has taken it up a notch this year, increasing the number of products and discounts on its website during Prime Days, according to StyleSage data. This is in contrast to most U.S. mall stores, which have been cutting down on assortment and promotions this year, the data showed.
Home furnishing retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond is offering an ""even bigger and better"" challenger event to Prime Day this year, with same-day delivery on orders $39 or more and rewards that give customers up to $100 for future purchases. 
Some of its top deals include 60% off on Crux appliances and 25% off on Graco (NYSE:GGG) Pack 'n Play baby cribs. 
Walmart's competing sales event will start one day ahead of Prime Day and end on June 22. The world's biggest retail chain, which launched its own subscription program called Walmart Plus last year, is offering deals on built-in  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) TVs and Roomba vacuum cleaners, among other electronic items.

Amazon Prime Day , which has grown into a two-day shopping bonanza rivaling the U.S. holiday shopping season, will see 20 countries participate this year. The event in India and Canada, however, has been postponed due to COVID-19. 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) expects Prime Day to top $11 billion in total online spend for U.S. retailers this year, surpassing sales generated on Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year.

Emanuel has been on the Live Nation board of directors since 2007 while Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, joined the Live Nation board in 2008, according to the Live Nation website. 
Both left the Live Nation board this month.
The Justice Department said it had expressed concern about the presence of the two men on the board creating ""an illegal interlocking directorate,"" where two competitors have the same people running them.
The problem cropped up last year when Endeavor bought On Location, which creates luxury packages for sports and music events for VIPs, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Live Nation also sells tickets and VIP packages to live music, sports and other entertainment, the department said.
""These resignations ensure that Endeavor and Live Nation will compete independently,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Richard Powers of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. ""Executives are not permitted to hold board positions on companies that compete with each other."" 

A spokesperson for Endeavor said there had been no violation of any law, adding: ""We understand and respect the DOJ’s (Justice Department's) concerns regarding the current similarities of our businesses.""
A spokesperson for Live Nation did not respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com -- Stocks surged on Monday after last week’s ugly end, with gains driven by energy and economically sensitive cyclicals. 
Energy as a sector rose as investors continued to bet on higher oil demand. A return of Iranian supply was pushed out further after Ebrahim Raisi won the country’s presidential election and said he wasn’t going to negotiate just to negotiate. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) estimates the price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, could reach $100 next year, after rising this year as the global economy reopened. Brent Oil Futures was up about 2% on Monday.
The return of the bull market optimism comes after the worst week for the broader market since October after comments from Federal Reserve officials spooked the market. 
Expectations for tighter monetary policy measures will weigh on valuations in 2022 but companies are expected to generate sufficient earnings to drive the broader market higher.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Powell visits Congress
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will face U.S. lawmakers in Congress on Tuesday to give them an update on the central bank's support for the economy through the pandemic, as some Fed watchers grow worried that prices and inflation will rise.
2. Earnings from  Plug Power  
Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) reports first quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts tracked by investing.com expect it to report a loss of 8 cents a share on revenue of $72.16 million. Shares of the hydrogen fuel cell maker are down 12% this year.
3. More housing data
Existing home sales are expected to decline for the fourth straight month when the numbers for May come out on Tuesday. They are seen hitting 5.72 million for the month, lower than April’s 5.85 million. A surge in demand for homes in recent months has pushed up prices for lumber and other construction materials.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) another chance to avoid an investor class action lawsuit accusing the bank of hiding conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis. 
The justices threw out a decision by the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that had allowed Goldman shareholders including the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System to sue as a group under a federal investor protection law. The plaintiffs accused the bank of unlawfully hiding conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities.
In directing the 2nd Circuit to reconsider the matter, the justices said the lower court had failed to properly assess whether the bank's statements that the investors had called misleading were too generic to have affected its stock price. 
The ruling, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, hands Goldman a victory - for now - in a class action in which the plaintiffs have said they lost more than $13 billion due to the bank's conduct. However, the decision clarified that the burden is still on defendants like Goldman to persuade a court that their alleged misstatements had no impact on the stock price - a finding that conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they disagreed with in a partial dissent. 
In a statement, one of the law firms representing the shareholders, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, welcomed the decision rejecting ""Goldman's effort to flip the burden of persuasion"" onto plaintiffs. 
""Since this case was first filed more than 11 years ago, Goldman Sachs has spared no expense to avoid facing a jury for misleading investors about its role in the financial crisis,"" the firm said. 
Goldman spokesperson Maeve DuVally said the bank was pleased with the decision and ""we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves as the case returns to the lower courts.""
The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and other pensions that purchased Goldman shares between February 2007 and June 2010 filed suit, accusing the company and three former executives of violating an anti-fraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a related SEC regulation. The plaintiffs said that the bank's fraudulent statements kept its stock price artificially high.
The case had been closely followed for clues as to how the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, would view shareholder class actions. Businesses often seek to limit the ability of plaintiffs to collectively sue in order to avoid the higher damages often awarded in such litigation.
The plaintiffs said that when they bought Goldman shares they relied upon the bank's statements about its ethical principles and internal controls against conflicts of interest, and its pledge that its ""clients' interests always come first."" 
Goldman argued that these ""aspirational"" statements were too vague and general to have had any impact on the stock price. 
The case stemmed from Goldman's sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson.
In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve charges that it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson's role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting that the sale of collateralized debt obligations would fail.
The plaintiffs said that the share price would have been lower if the truth had been known about the company's conflicts of interest.

The 2nd Circuit last year upheld a federal judge's decision to let the plaintiffs sue as a group and rejected one of the company's arguments that generic statements can never impact a stock price. 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a partial dissent in the case, saying the 2nd Circuit's decision should have been affirmed.

Consequently, mid-cap fast food stocks The Wendy’s Company (WEN), Papa John's (PZZA), and Jack in the Box (JACK), which possess robust growth potential, could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now. Read on.The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the global restaurant industry. In fact, the National Restaurant Association characterized 2020 as the “the most challenging year for the restaurant industry.” Nevertheless, companies adapted to the changing circumstances by building robust home delivery networks and drive-thrus. These adaptations allowed quick-service restaurants to generate a substantial increase in order volumes.
Dine-in restaurants have been making a strong comeback over the past couple of months owing to pent-up demand from patrons following nearly a year of take out orders, takeaways and home deliveries. The National Restaurant Association projects a 10.2% increase in total sales at U.S restaurants this year, with an 8% rise in sales at limited service fast food chains.
Given this backdrop, we think mid-cap restaurant operators The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA), and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK) should grow substantially in the coming months. As such, shares of these companies could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force said Monday they had signed an agreement on commercial space activities in Florida and California aimed at streamlining regulatory barriers.
Under the agreement, the FAA will accept the Air Force’s ground safety rules and other safety processes, analyses, and products as long as they satisfy FAA regulations, while the Air Force will accept FAA licensing decisions and generally will not impose its own requirements for the flight aspect of a launch or reentry. 
The agreement recognizes common safety standards that originate or return to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
Last year, the FAA licensed 39 commercial space launches, the most in agency history. Of those, 24 occurred at the two Space Force stations.
""The launch licensing standards provided in the agreement will support a rapidly expanding commercial launch sector and strengthen our space industrial base, bolstering our economy and enhancing our security as a nation,"" said Acting Secretary of the Air Force John P. Roth in a statement.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said ""building a streamlined regulatory approach for commercial space activities at these federal launch sites is the right thing to do for public safety and U.S. competitiveness.""

Nubank's founder and Chief Executive David Vélez had said as recently as this month that an IPO was likely to happen at some point but was not in the company's plans. 
Its discussions with banks illustrate that the preparations for a stock market debut, which one of the sources said could value Nubank at more than $40 billion, are more advanced than previously known.
The IPO could happen by the end of this year or early 2022, two of the sources said. It would be one of the biggest ever stock market debuts of a South American company, putting it on par with other expected high-profile offerings such as of online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the IPO preparations are confidential. A spokesperson for Nubank, whose legal name is Nu Pagamentos SA, declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group representing major U.S. airlines and aviation unions on Monday wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking the Justice Department to prosecute the growing number of disruptive and violent air passengers.
The Justice Department did not immediately comment on the letter, first reported by Reuters.
The letter from Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and others, along with major unions said the ""incidents pose a safety and security threat to our passengers and employees, and we respectfully request the (Justice Department) commit to the full and public prosecution of onboard acts of violence.""
The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Steve Dickson, in January imposed a zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on some flights around the time of a Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack.
The agency has pursued some form of enforcement action more than 400 times in the first five months of 2021, compared to a year-end total of 146 in 2019, and has initiated 57 civil penalty actions. Flight attendants and other airline officials ascribe the rise to increased societal conflict and differences over how to address the coronavirus pandemic from mask requirements to limits on alcohol consumption.
Monday's letter added that the airlines and unions hope the Justice Department ""will commit to taking action, along with coordination with the FAA, to ensure that egregious onboard conduct is fully and criminally prosecuted, sending a strong public message of deterrence, safety and security.""
In a separate letter to Dickson, the groups asked the FAA to ""refer abhorrent cases"" to the Justice Department ""so that the federal government may fully, swiftly and publicly prosecute criminal acts to the fullest extent of the law and deter this dangerous and concerning behavior.""
An FAA spokesman said the agency ""will continue to work with local law enforcement and the DOJ to make it clear that unsafe and unruly behavior simply does not fly.""
The letter to Garland said that since the FAA's zero- tolerance policy was announced, the agency has received more than 3,039 reports of unruly behavior and has opened 465 investigations into assaults, threats of assault or interference with crew members.
More than 2,300 cases included passengers refusing to wear face masks as required on all airplanes, while Delta has banned more than 1,200 people from future flights for failing to wear masks. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on April 30 extended a federal face mask mandate on airplanes and in airports through Sept. 13.
In May, the Transport Workers Union of America, which represents Southwest flight attendants and was among the signers, said in a letter there were 477 passenger misconduct incidents on Southwest Airlines from April 8 to May 15.
""This past weekend, one of our Flight Attendants was seriously assaulted, resulting in injuries to the face and a loss of two teeth,"" the union wrote in a May 24 letter to Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly. ""Today’s traveling environment requires a new level of firmness in both tone and direction to ensure proper control in the cabin.""
On June 11, two passengers on a United flight were removed from a plane before it left San Francisco for fighting over an arm rest, according to the airline and fellow passengers.

The FAA has been proposing large civil penalties for disruptive passengers including for some who have assaulted flight attendants. Many have been fined for drinking alcohol onboard airlines, where it is still banned and several airlines have extended the alcohol ban because of poor passenger behavior.
Others signing the letter were the Air Line Pilots Association, Allied Pilots Association and Association of Flight Attendants and Regional Airline Association.

(Reuters) - COVID-19 therapies made from a cocktail of two types of antibodies were effective against a wide range of variants of the coronavirus in a mice and hamster study, the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis reported on Monday.
Antibodies are used to treat cases of COVID-19, often early in the process. Former U.S. President Donald Trump was treated by an antibody cocktail by Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmaceuticals in October after he tested positive for COVID-19. 
The latest study included three of the four variants that have been designated ""variants of concern"" by the World Health Organization, including Alpha, first identified in the UK, Beta, first found in South Africa and Gamma found in Brazil, as well as an emerging variant from India similar to the Delta variant of concern. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April revoked the emergency use authorization of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)'s single antibody therapy, bamlanivimab, saying there was increased circulation of variants resistant to the therapy when used alone.
Other studies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-science-idUSKBN29W2P5 have previously shown that some antibody combination therapies remained potent against those emerging variants of the coronavirus that were resistant to single antibody therapies.
The latest study found that combinations of two antibodies often retained potency against variants even when one of the two antibodies lost some or all ability to neutralize the variant in lab studies. 
The study, which was conducted in mice and hamsters, tested all single and combination antibody therapies authorized for emergency use by the FDA against emerging international and U.S. variants of the virus. 
The researchers evaluated the FDA authorized combination therapies made by Regeneron, Eli Lilly and a single antibody therapy, sotrovimab, by Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) Inc and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc.

They also assessed the antibodies currently in clinical trials by  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), Vir and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). 
""Resistance arose with some of the monotherapies, but never with combination therapy,"" study co-author Jacco Boon wrote.

So, we think the rising demand and their ability to gradually increase their supply positions  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), Rohm (ROHCY), Kulicke and Soffa Industries (KLIC), and HIMAX Technologies (HMIX) nicely for solid growth. Let’s discuss.The semiconductor industry is expected to continue seeing rising demand this year and beyond with the increasing adoption of cloud technologies, 5G solutions, and rising demand from the booming electric vehicles (EV) industry. While the global chip shortage is expected to persist for some time because of lean inventory resulting from plant shutdowns and slowdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent production delays caused by a fire at Japan’s Renesas Electronics plant, government initiatives worldwide to create a more secure supply chain bodes well for the industry going forward. In fact, the global semiconductor manufacturing market is expected to reach $95.9 billion by 2025, representing a 9% CAGR during the period.
With chip manufacturers intensifying investments and aggressively adding capacity to meet the growing demand from electronics, automotive, and other sectors, the industry is expected to witness significant growth in the coming months. Consequently, the industry has been enjoying favorable investor sentiment, as evidenced by the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF’s (SMH) 68% returns over the past year compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s 34.4% gains over this period.
Given the rising demand for semiconductors from various industries, chip stocks such as NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI), Rohm Co Ltd (ROHCY), Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 jumped Monday, as bargain-hunting investors took advantage of the last week's sea of red in the market, swooping in to buy economically-sensitive cyclicals stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.63%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.69%.
Energy led the broader market higher, up 3% as investors continued to bet on higher oil demand, while the prospect of return of Iranian supply was pushed out further after Ebrahim Raisi won the country’s presidential election.
Raisi told reporters that Iran wouldn't “negotiate for the sake of negotiations” and ruled out any meeting with President Joe Biden. 
Banking stocks were also among the top gainers, underpinning the broader financials higher,  after a slump last week as U.S. yields rebounded from lows, with the United States 10-Year near 1.5% after trading as low as 1.35% intraday.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) were up more than 1%, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) jumped nearly 3%.
The move higher in value stocks didn't serve up the rotation away from growth as technology also participated in the broader market melt up.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were above the flatline, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the red.
The positive swing in investor sentiment on stocks followed the worst week for the broader market since October as the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt spooked investors.
“I put us starting in late 2022,”  St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC. ""[M]y forecast said 3% inflation in 2021 -- core PCE inflation -- and 2.5% core PCE inflation in 2022.""
But while the expectations for tighter monetary policy measures will weigh on valuations in 2022, companies are expected to generate sufficient earnings to drive the broader market higher.
""We expect earnings to drive returns in 2022. We estimate that earnings per share in the S&P 500 Index will increase to $220 in 2022, though rising interest rates could put downward pressure on price/earnings ratios in 2022,"" Wells Fargo said in a note.
""Our year-end median price target for the S&P 500 Index is 4,900,"" it added. That estimated price target represents about 14% upside from current levels.

Let’s discuss.International stocks are a solid investment option when the domestic market is volatile because they help diversify a portfolio given that their performance is influenced by different external or macroeconomic factors than domestic stocks. They also can present a wide range of opportunities that are unavailable with domestic stocks.
Because the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates sooner than expected to control inflation, global stocks are experiencing a pullback.
However, there are other country-specific factors that could drive the performance of many international stocks in the near term. So, we think it could be wise to diversify one’s portfolio by adding a few high-quality international stocks.

Read on.Auto manufacturing declined sharply last year thanks to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and a decline in demand for vehicles. And even as major economies are now gradually reopening, the auto manufacturing industry continues to be impacted by a global semiconductor chip shortage. According to Statista, the global sales of automobiles are expected to fall to below 70 million units in 2021.
Investors’ pessimism regarding the auto manufacturing industry is evident in the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 3.7% returns over the past three months versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 6.4% gains. While some auto manufacturers may be able to weather these trying conditions, we think it is wise to avoid fundamentally weak stocks in this space that are trading at premiums to their peers.
Ferrari N.V. (RACE), and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) look significantly overvalued at their current price levels. Also, Wall Street analysts have recently downgraded their ratings on these stocks. So, we think these two stocks are best avoided now.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",Morrisons leaps after rejecting $7.6 billion private equity bid,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Morrisons shares surged as much as 35% on Monday on hopes that U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) might raise its proposed offer for the British supermarket group or flush out other bidders.
Britain's fourth-largest grocer by sales behind Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda, said on Saturday that it had rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pounds ($7.62 billion) cash offer from CD&R.
The surprise approach underlines private equity's growing appetite for supermarkets in Britain, attracted by their steady cash generation and freehold real estate assets.
Morrisons owns 85% of its nearly 500 stores and has 19 mostly freehold manufacturing sites. It is unique among British supermarkets in making over half of the fresh food it sells. 
It said CD&R's 230 pence per share offer, which including net debt of 3.17 billion pounds gives Morrisons an enterprise value of 8.7 billion pounds, ""significantly undervalued"" the group and its prospects.
Shares in Morrisons closed up 61.8 pence at 235 pence in the first day of trading after the offer, which was made at a 29% premium to Friday's closing price, became publicly known.
""The sector generally looks undervalued, and private equity look to be interested in Morrisons partly because it has a lot of freehold property which they would ‘sale and leaseback’ to generate cash to pay back to themselves,"" Andrew Koch, senior fund manager, active equities at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), said of the move.
""That’s not adding any genuine value, and the company could do that themselves. So I would personally not expect a bid to succeed at that level,"" added Koch at LGIM, which Refinitiv data shows as having a 1.58% stake in Morrisons.
Analysts said they expected CD&R to assess investor reaction before deciding its next move. 
Under British takeover rules CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, has until July 17 to announce a firm offer or walk away. 
Shares in rivals Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) rose as much as 3.2%, 5.7% and 4.1% respectively on hopes the whole sector was now in play, analysts said, adding that some short sellers were also closing out positions.
Silchester and Columbia Threadneedle, Morrisons' two largest investors, which Refinitiv data showed having stakes of 15% and 7.4% respectively, both declined to comment.
In addition to the possibility of other private equity players entering the fray, there has long been speculation that U.S. giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership agreement with Morrisons, could emerge as a possible bidder. 
Amazon declined to comment. 
With a staff of 118,000, Morrisons is one of the UK's biggest private sector employers and Britain's opposition Labour Party warned on Sunday that a private equity acquisition could put jobs at risk.
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to comment on the situation, while shopworkers union Usdaw, which represents Morrisons staff, also had no comment.
SUPERMARKET SWEEP
Industry executives and some sector analysts believe the stock market has failed to recognise the inherent value in Britain's listed supermarket groups.
They argue that if equity markets do not value them appropriately, acquirers will.
""Investors want a very binary story about knuckling down, keeping capex to a minimum and just becoming a cash machine,"" one senior supermarket executive told Reuters.
The executive said it was possible that even Tesco, with an equity market value of 17.3 billion pounds, could receive an approach.
Zuber and Mohsin Issa joined forces with private equity firm TDR Capital to buy a majority stake in Asda from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in a deal valuing the group at 6.8 billion pounds.
That deal completed in February and followed the competition regulator's blocking of Sainsbury's takeover of Asda in 2019.

In April, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake in Sainsbury's to almost 10%, igniting bid speculation.

Investing.com -- Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) jumped more than 3% after Barron's reported things are looking up.
The recovery's coming faster than expected, as evidenced by first quarter results showing 1.3 million people went to the parks versus the Wall Street estimate of 600,000, Barron's said. And the summer season that just began is historically its strongest.
Six Flags stands to gain from pent up demand, but investors appear to be underestimating the impact on the company. 
“We’re big believers that there’s still an opportunity here for a recovery trade,” says Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski, according to Barron's. “People are leaving their homes now in droves, and they’re spending like crazy.

The forced landing of a Ryanair passenger plane in Minsk on May 23 to arrest a dissident journalist has sparked fresh sanctions from the European Union, the United States, Canada and the UK. The curbs include a raft of measures against individuals and firms.
Majority-owned by G7 powers, the EBRD has faced scrutiny after other institutions such as the EU's lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB), said they would stop funding new projects in Belarus as part of the bloc's response to last year's disputed re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko.
EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said the bank had stopped fresh financing for sovereign projects completely since last August and also put a de-facto halt to new sub-sovereign projects. However, the lender's shareholders had not yet decided on whether the lender should stop investing in the country altogether while curbs coming in targeted specific firms and individuals, she added. 
""What we have been doing still is projects in the private sector,"" Renaud-Basso told Reuters, adding the lender had been cautious to focus investments on firms not related to the government and to the central power.
""There is a case for supporting small companies not related to the government and providing some support to the population, but of course there is a political choice (to make) and we have to go back to our shareholders who will make it at some point.""
Halting projects that the bank had already committed to in previous years could prove difficult, however, she added. 
Having a mandate to operate in countries that are ""applying principles of multiparty democracy and pluralism,"" the EBRD halted all investments in Russia in 2014 after Moscow's annexation of Crimea.
""Our strategy, as defined by the bank in 2018, is still relevant,"" she said. ""That involves accompanying evolution and reform in countries and adjusting our investments as necessary. That strategy is still relevant and the best way forward.""

The EBRD has invested more than 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) across 142 projects in Belarus over the past 20-plus years. Of those, 63% were made in the private sector. Nearly half of those projects are still active, with its current portfolio in the country at 1 billion euros, according to EBRD data.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Walmart's Flipkart sees nothing wrong in offering to cut charges for sellers on its platform if they lower product prices, its lawyer told an Indian court on Monday, drawing protest from a retailer group challenging the practice.
Flipkart and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are in a court battle against the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) bid to restart an investigation into their business practices, after a judge in early June dismissed the companies' pleas.
Both Flipkart and Amazon have for years battled accusations from brick-and-mortar Indian retailers that they bypass the foreign investment law by favouring some sellers and influencing prices of products, which are prohibited. The companies say they comply with all laws.
Arguing against the resumption of the antitrust investigation, Flipkart's counsel Harish Salve told a two-judge bench in the southern state of Karnataka that he sees nothing wrong in telling the sellers of Flipkart marketplace that they will be charged a lower fee, if they reduce their prices.
Referring in particular to the Hindu festival of Diwali when websites organise sales, he added: ""I tell my sellers at a time like Diwali if you reduce your prices, I will give you a reduction in rent. What's wrong?""
The comments drew immediate criticism from the Confederation of All India Traders, which is party to the ongoing litigation opposing the e-commerce giants, saying the practices were prohibited under India's foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.
The comments ""clearly corroborate the view and complaints made by CAIT time and again. FDI policy specifically provides that marketplace should not influence prices"", said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT, which represents 80 million retail stores in the country.
India's foreign investment law for e-commerce says ""entities providing (a) marketplace will not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services"".

A Reuters investigation http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W in February based on internal Amazon documents showed the U.S. firm has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers, doling out discounted fees and lowering the platform fees for some to enable them to offer more competitive prices. 
Amazon has said it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller"" and prices are only decided by sellers.

Outraged at the forced landing of a passenger plane in Minsk on May 23 to arrest the dissident journalist, EU has blacklisted transport, defence and air traffic officials as part of coordinated action with the United States, Canada and Britain.
Gutseriyev is among the individuals facing sanctions, according to the EU Official Journal. His spokeswoman declined to comment.
Gutseriyev's Safmar company has a stake in Russian oil producer Russneft and it controls consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado.
Moscow-traded shares of M.Video-Eldorado and Russneft fell by around 4% and 1% respectively. 
The EU said Gutseriyev was a long-standing friend of Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
It said Gutseriyev owns the Slavkali company, which is building the Nezhinsky potassium chloride mining and processing plant, based on the Starobinsky potash salt deposit near Lyuban, in Belarus.
Lukashenko has promised to rename the town Gutserievsk in his honour.
The Russian businessman helped Belarus with oil supplies in early 2020 when other Russian companies suspended the deliveries over the supply terms dispute.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog called for KPMG's UK arm to be fined more than 15 million pounds ($21 million) on Monday over a 'conflict of interest' when it advised on the sale of bed maker Silentnight.
KPMG, which is one of the world's Big Four auditors and was advising on the sale to U.S. private equity company HIG Capital in 2011, said the fine should be no more than 5 million pounds, and that it no longer has a restructuring business.
An independent tribunal was held on Monday to determine sanctions on KPMG and one of its partners following the tribunal's ""adverse findings"" of loss of objectivity.
The sanctions hearing continues on Tuesday and typically the tribunal then publishes its decision at a later date.
""The tribunal's findings that the respondents lost their objectivity and dishonestly advanced, or associated themselves with, misleading statements are particularly serious and unusual,"" the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) executive counsel said at the hearing.
""If the respondents had properly addressed and dealt with threats to their objectivity, including the conflict of interest, they would not have been able to advise and assist both HIG and Silentnight,"" the FRC said.
The FRC asked for a fine of not less than 15 million pounds plus a ""substantial uplift to reflect aggravating features"".
KPMG said the tribunal's findings related to restructuring work performed over a decade ago and the fine being sought was ""overly punitive"" and ""disportionate"".
""We will consider those findings and our options for a possible appeal at the appropriate time,"" KPMG said in a statement, adding that it disagreed with a number of the arguments put forward by the FRC.

KPMG is also being investigated by the FRC for its role in auditing Carillion, the builder whose high-profile collapse led to a root-and-branch review of auditing in Britain. Any fine sought by the watchdog in this case would be also be hefty.

However, given the company’s high debt and unstable cash flows, analysts expect its stock to tumble in the near term. Alternatively, established mall-based retail companies Gap (GPS), and  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) have reported substantial improvements in their financials in their last reported quarters, and we think are well-positioned to deliver higher returns in the near term.Video Game retailer GameStop, Inc. (GME) is famous for kickstarting the “meme” stock frenzy, popularized by the Reddit community Wallstreetbets. GME was targeted primarily by retail investors earlier—who overlooked the company’s surmounting debt, unstable financials and inadequate cash flows—because it was heavily shorted by hedge funds. Shares of GME have soared 4,219.6% over the past year, and 1034.9% year-to-date. In fact, the short squeeze has caused a $4.50 billion loss by hedge funds so far this year.
However, the current market volatility and rising inflation are causing investors to focus on stocks that could offer relatively steady returns. Analysts expect GME to hit $70 soon, indicating a potential 67.35 decline from its last closing price of $213.82. Big-short investor Michael Burry recently warned retail investors regarding an impending “Mother of all Crashes” through a now-deleted Twitter post.
Given this backdrop, we think meme stock GME is best avoided now. However, many retail companies are regaining traction amid the fast-paced economic recovery as consumers opt for in-person shopping over e-commerce purchases following more than a year of social distancing. As such, established mall-based retailers, The Gap, Inc. (GPS), and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) have reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth in their last reported quarters and we think are poised to grow further in the coming quarters. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal that has gained a reputation for canceling patents to continue operating, but reined in the power of its in-house judges.
The justices, in a 5-4 ruling authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld a 2019 lower court decision that the judges on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board were appointed in a way that violates a U.S. Constitution provision intended to ensure accountability for powerful government officials. 
The U.S. government had appealed the lower court ruling in a legal challenge pursued by privately held Florida-based medical device company Arthrex Inc.
The ruling indicates that the tribunal's current structure failed to provide for enough direct review of the patent judges - who have power to invalidate issued patents - by their superiors who are accountable to the U.S. president to satisfy constitutional requirements.
While the Supreme Court's majority found that the administrative patent judges were improperly appointed, a different majority of justices also concluded that the problem could be fixed under the Constitution by giving the Patent and Trademark Office's director the power to review decisions by the judges. 
The Supreme Court took a different approach than the solution offered by the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, to remove certain job protections for the judges, giving their superiors more power to fire them at will.
Noting that billions of dollars can turn on a decision by the board, Roberts wrote, ""What matters is that the director have the discretion to review decisions rendered by APJs (administrative patent judges). In this way, the president remains responsible for the exercise of executive power - and through him, the exercise of executive power remains accountable to the people.""
The solution prescribed by the justices would allow the tribunal to continue to operate, though the Patent and Trademark Office has already said more than 100 cases will have to be reconsidered.
The board, an administrative court run by the Patent and Trademark Office, takes a second look at patents issued by the agency and often cancels them, much to the dismay of some inventors. The tribunal, created by Congress in 2011, adjudicates the validity of hundreds of patents annually and has invalidated more than 2,000 patents.
The tribunal's reviews have become a quick and cheap way for companies that are prime targets for infringement suits, such as such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, to try to invalidate patents. Litigation before the tribunal is seen by many companies as a more efficient alternative to resolving cases in federal court.
Arthrex had challenged the constitutionality of the judges' appointments after the tribunal in 2018 invalidated part of the company's patent for a surgical device for re-attaching soft tissue to bone. British-based rival Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) PLC had requested the review of Arthrex's patent. 
Monday's ruling rejected Arthrex's argument to hold the entire tribunal unconstitutional and said that the agency's director should now decide whether the dispute should be reheard. 
At issue was whether the patent judges were appointed in violation of the Constitution's so-called appointments clause, which requires certain high government officials - known as ""principal officers"" - to be named by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
Other ""inferior officers"" with lesser authority may be appointed and supervised by department heads, who are themselves named by the president. A president can fire principal officers at will, but patent judges, as members of the civil service, possess certain job protections including from unrestricted removal.

The dissenting justices called the ruling unnecessary. 
""Just who are these 'principal' officers that Congress unsuccessfully sought to smuggle into the executive branch without Senate confirmation? About 250 administrative patent judges who sit at the bottom of an organizational chart,"" wrote conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by the court's three liberal justices.

The splurge is set to happen amid a record $5.5 trillion of cash that’s sitting idle, having swollen through the pandemic, Goldman strategists led by David J. Kostin wrote in a note. They expect corporations to be the biggest source of equity demand for the rest of 2021, with buybacks set to accelerate and issuance poised to slow from peak first-quarter levels.
In the first quarter, households bought a net $172 billion of equities, Goldman said, with demand set to be boosted further by swollen levels of cash and growing market participation by retail investors that has led to the wild swings seen in so-called meme stocks this year.
Investor appetite for equities shows no sign of abating, even as U.S. and European stocks trade close to record highs and as U.S. Federal Reserve officials signal they’re getting ready to scale back stimulus.

(Reuters) - Harvard University won the dismissal on Monday of a lawsuit by students over its decision not to partially refund tuition when it moved classes online early in the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said three students leading the proposed class action failed to show that Harvard had contractually promised them in-person instruction and access to on-campus facilities during the spring 2020 semester.
Noting that ""spring 2020 was not a normal time,"" the Boston-based judge said such an expectation was unreasonable ""where, during a global pandemic, the governor and public health officials dictated otherwise.""
The lawsuit was brought by law student Abraham Barkhordar and two master's degree candidates, Ella Wechsler-Matthaei in education and Sarah Zelasky in public health, on behalf of students in Harvard's 12 degree-granting schools.
Many colleges and universities with high price tags were sued by students over the lack of tuition refunds. Talwani said some courts have found no binding contracts requiring in-person instruction at all times.
Lawyers for the Harvard plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Swain declined to comment.
Talwani also rejected Barkhordar's bid for a partial refund for the fall 2020 semester, after he agreed to pay full tuition for online-only instruction.
He had claimed Harvard had given him a ""coercive choice"" between taking classes remotely or delaying his education.
Harvard did offer partial tuition refunds for students who chose to take leaves of absence.

Tuition for Harvard full-time students in the 2021-2022 academic year is $67,720 at the law school, $64,998 for a master of public health, and $51,904 in education.
The case is Barkhordar et al v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-10968.

The government is supposed to decide this month among the Eurofighter from Airbus, the Rafale from France's Dassault, Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s F/A-18 Super Hornet, or the F35-A.
Swiss voters in September backed the government's plan to spend up to 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.53 billion) on new fighter jets in a surprisingly close referendum.
""According to insiders, Switzerland can buy a larger number of F-35s with the budgeted 6 billion Swiss francs than would be the case with the three competitors. The F-35's simulator could also be an asset: it would allow the F-35 to carry out significantly more virtual training missions than the competition,"" SRF's investigative programme Rundschau said in a summary of a report https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/endspurt-kampfjetbeschaffung-amherd-will-den-ferrari-der-luefte-kaufen to air on Wednesday. 
The defence ministry declined to comment.
The aircraft will replace Switzerland's ageing fleet of 30 F/A-18 Hornets, which will go out of service in 2030. New jets are to be delivered by 2025.

At least two of the seven Cabinet members would prefer a European fighter jet, SRF said, while critics have promised to launch a referendum campaign under the Swiss system of direct democracy against any decision to buy a U.S. fighter jet.

996,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Google Shuts London Startup Hub in Home Working Pivot,"(Bloomberg) -- Google’s parent firm plans to close its seven-story hub devoted to helping startups in London’s Shoreditch district and replace it with virtual services following the shift to home-working.
The move comes after the pandemic showed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. that it could serve young firms across the country without the need for a physical space, according to a statement Monday. Google was forced to offer its support programs and services online when the coronavirus struck.
“The U.K. startup community doesn’t need access to a single-shared physical space as much as it needs access to resources, mentors, and programs available at scale, anywhere,” Google said in the statement. “And so as the ecosystem develops, so does our approach.”
Google opened the Campus facility near the Old Street gyratory -- dubbed ‘Silicon Roundabout’ -- in 2012. The area was hailed as Tech City by former prime minister David Cameron and was the epicenter of the country’s fast growing digital economy as low rents and easy access to the financiers in the City of London drew firms.
Since then, the growth of the startup scene in the Shoreditch district has helped drive property rents and values higher than those in traditionally dominant areas like the City, according to data compiled by broker Carter Jonas.
But the increasing move toward flexible and home working among technology companies makes it vulnerable. Rents in the area, where landlords including Derwent London Plc and Helical Plc have developed large office buildings, could fall as much as 12.5% in the year through March 2022, Carter Jonas forecasts.
Big technology companies have been among the most vocal about allowing workers to work more flexibly even after the pandemic ends. Google expects about 60% of its staff to work in the office a few days a week, with about 20% able to apply to work permanently from home.
That’s a stark contrast with finance where executives at banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have led calls for a return to the office.

Moreover, an improvement in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and a significant increase in total client assets should lead to a substantial improvement in its primary business segments. Since the stock’s price has declined 10.9% over the past month, let’s evaluate if this is an opportune time to bet on the name. Read on.Leading financial services company Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) offers banking, investment, and commercial finance and mortgage services in the United States and overseas. The company operates in the consumer banking and lending, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, and wealth and investment management segments.
A significant improvement in commercial mortgage-backed securities gains, in addition to improved trading and higher investment banking fees, have helped WFC deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2021. The stock has gained 66.1% over the past nine months and 38.3% year-to-date. However, its shares have retreated 10.9% over the past month.
Closing yesterday’s session at $41.75, WFC is trading 13.3% below its 52-week high of $48.13. With a strong U.S. economic recovery, both consumer and commercial loans are expected to witness a significant uptick in demand. This should help drive the company’s growth and improve its business operations and efficiency. Furthermore, accelerated we think consumer investment and spending should allow WFC to deliver impressive returns in the near term.

Thus, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.The U.S. stock market has been volatile since the Federal Reserve’s comment last week that interest rate hikes could come as soon as 2023, after saying as recently as March that it saw no increases coming until at least 2024. With several stocks currently trading at sky-high valuations, investors are also anticipating a market correction. Against this backdrop, investors are turning to quality growth stocks because they are expected to generate market-beating returns over the long run, dodging the short-term fluctuations.
Investors’ relatively heightened interest in growth stocks is evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 4.9% gains over the past month compared to the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 2.9% loss.

MILAN (Reuters) -CNH Industrial has struck a $2.1 billion deal to buy Raven Industries to bolster its agricultural equipment business, as the Italian-American vehicle maker prepares to spin off its truck, bus and engine operations.
Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) shares rose by 50% in New York early Monday, lifting its market capitalization into line with the terms proposed by CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), whose Milan-listed stock turned slightly positive after initially falling by as much as 5.6%.
CNH Industrial is the world's second largest agricultural equipment maker after John Deere (NYSE:DE), operating under the New Holland, Case IH and Steyr brands.
""Precision agriculture and autonomy are critical components of our strategy,"" CNH Industrial Chief Executive Scott Wine said of the acquisition of Raven, which also produces high-performance specialty films as well as aerospace and defense solutions. 
Wine described the proposed purchase as ""truly transformative"" and left the door open to more acquisitions to expand what it is able to offer in the businesses it retains.
""We will absolutely consider strategic acquisitions if we need to grow faster or more profitably,"" he told analysts.
CNH Industrial will pay $58 per share for the U.S. agriculture technology company, a 33.6% premium to Raven's four-week volume-weighted average stock price, giving it an enterprise value of $2.1 billion, the companies said.
The deal is expected to generate around $400 million of run-rate revenue synergies by 2025, resulting in $150 million of incremental core profits (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), they added.
Analysts at Bestinver Securities said the news was positive as Raven's ""cutting-edge"" technology in the agriculture industry would further enhance CNH Industrial capabilities.
""However, we point out that the acquisition came at cost,"" they said in a note.
CNH Industrial said it would complete early next year a plan to spin off and separately list its lower-margin Iveco truck and bus units along with its FPT engine division, to boost asset values and streamline its businesses.
It will also retain its construction equipment business after the spin-off.
The Raven buy, which marks the largest M&A deal for CNH Industrial since it was formed in 2013, requires approval from Raven's shareholders. It is expected to close in the fourth quarter and will be funded with CNH's available cash, the companies said in a joint statement. 

CNH Industrial, which is controlled by Italy's Agnelli family through its holding company Exor (OTC:EXXRF), said it did not expect the proposed acquisition to have any impact on its financial forecasts for this year, including cash flow.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were financial advisors to CNH Industrial in the deal, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities advised  Raven Industries .

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 10:47AM ET</span>","In Paris without tourists, LVMH unveils Samaritaine store revamp","By Silvia Aloisi
PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH unveiled on Monday the revamped La Samaritaine, a 150-year-old department store designed to help it grab a greater slice of tourist spending once pandemic travel curbs are eased.
After a seven-year makeover, the historic store will reopen to the public on June 23 and rival the likes of Galeries Lafayette, housing a hotel, restaurants and shops. Its reopening, originally scheduled for last year, was delayed by the coronavirus emergency.
With contagion rates falling in most of Europe, France began to lift restrictions in mid-May but foreign travellers, particularly non-Europeans, are still largely absent.
Spending by visitors to France remains a major source of income for high-end brands, even if Chinese shoppers, the industry's number one clientele, have been buying a lot more at home during the pandemic - a shift expected to outlast the health emergency. 
LVMH, behind fashion and accessories labels like Louis Vuitton, makes 8% of its 45 billion euros sales in France alone, and already owns upmarket Parisian department store Le Bon Marche.
Its latest venture, with 20,000 square meters of shopping space, sits on the banks of the Seine, close to tourist magnets like Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre museum.
La Samaritaine is famed for its 1920-era building and gilded Art Deco facade but the revamped store will include a 100-metre airport-style moving walkway through a tunnel to nearby parking.
Facing competition from online retailers, department stores were seeking to reinvent themselves as day-trip destinations even before the COVID 19 pandemic. The crisis has forced several prestigious U.S. names to file for bankruptcy.
Eleonore de Boysson, the Europe and Middle East head of DFS Group - a retail and duty free company majority owned by LVMH which runs the department store - said it may take one or two years for tourists to return en masse to France. La Samaritaine expects around 5 million visitors a year when things go back to normal.
""We wanted to reopen at a time when life is starting to come back,"" she said. 
The store will host 600 brands, of which 50 exclusively, and offer shoppers a wide range of prices. 
It hopes to rival peers like Qatari-controlled Printemps and family-owned Galeries Lafayette. Some 37 million shoppers visit the latter's main store in Paris every year.
LVMH, which first snapped up a stake in La Samaritaine in 2001, has spent 750 million euros on its makeover, which includes a contemporary, undulating glass exterior on one side by Japanese architectural duo SANAA. 

The store had to shut its doors in 2005 as its original glass flooring was not sufficiently fire-resistant.
The complex will include a luxury rooftop hotel and be home to 96 flats under a social housing scheme.

Amazon, founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, remained the world's most valuable brand with an estimated value of $684 billion, followed by Apple, founded in 1976, at $612 billion and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at $458 billion, Kantar said.
Tencent, China's biggest social media and video games company, was the People's Republic's top brand, in fifth place, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) was in seventh place. 
""Chinese brands are steadily and slowly progressing, and have made significant headway as more companies leverage their own technological developments and demonstrate their abilities to align with the major trends shaping China and the global market,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Staplehurst, global strategy director at Kantar BrandZ. 
Five brands more than doubled their value, led by Chinese e-commerce giants  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and Meituan, China's top liquor maker Moutai, China's TikTok and America's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Tesla, founded in 2003, was the fastest growing brand and became the most valuable car brand, growing its value by 275% year-on-year to $42.6 billion, Kantar said.
Top Chinese brands consolidated their lead over top European brands: China accounted for 14% of the top 100 brands, up from 11% a decade ago, while European brands accounted for 8%, down from 20% a decade ago, Kantar said.
The top European brand was France's Louis Vuitton in 21st place, followed by Germany's SAP software group in 26th place. The only British brand on the list was Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) in 60th place. 

U.S. brands were dominant: American brands grew fastest over the past year and American brands accounted for 74% of the top 100, Kantar said.
The world's top 100 brands were worth a combined $7.1 trillion, Kantar said.

And strong growth in its primary IQOS smoke-free products business, along with its continued advancement in research and technology to strengthen its operations, should position the company well to maintain or raise its dividends. As such, we think the stock is a solid pick for investors looking for a steady stream of income. Read on.Incorporated in 1987, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) manufactures and sells nicotine-based products, related accessories and devices, and IQOS smoke-free products. PM’s shares have advanced 33.4% over the past year and 20.2% so far this year. The company delivered strong top and bottom-line results in its last reported quarter, driven by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume in East Asia and Australia and favorable pricing. Since its market debut in 2008, PM has raised its annual dividend every year, amounting to a 160.9% total increase, or an 8.3% CAGR.
Tobacco companies benefit significantly from the highly addictive nature of their products. And thanks to PM’s attractive dividend yields and dividend increase history, we think it’s an ideal pick for income investors. 
With the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep short-term interest rates anchored near zero and the stock market’s current fluctuations as the backdrop, we think PM could prove to be a solid bet from both stability and dividend viewpoints.

Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) and Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) are two growth stocks poised to see their shares rise in the weeks ahead. Read more to learn why.Growth stocks, which took a back seat to their value counterparts from January through May of this year, have been bouncing back in the past month. For example, the S&P SPDR 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) is up 5% in the past month, compared to a 2% loss for the S&P SPDR 500 Value ETF (SPYV). I believe the main driver of this performance is less concern over inflation and lower treasury yields.
Treasury yields had been rising over the past couple of months due to concerns over inflation. Inflation is considered a negative to growth stocks as it discounts a growth stock’s present value. But investors have since changed their tune and now view inflation as transitory. This has led to lower treasury yields and higher stock prices for growth stocks. While the Fed just announced plans to raise rates in 2023, there’s still plenty of time to generate strong returns in growth stocks if you know where to look. 
I like to focus on four components of our proprietary POWR Ratings system when looking for top growth stocks. I want a stock with a Strong Buy rating that also has a grade of A for Growth Grade, Value Grade, and a Momentum Grade. I call these the four aces. These are highly rated stocks based on 118 different factors and exhibit strong growth characteristics. Plus, they’re undervalued and trading in an uptrend, making it the perfect time to buy. Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) and Signet Jewelers (SIG) certainly fit the bill.

So, to dodge short-term market fluctuations led by concerns such as rising inflation, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound blue-chip stocks Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Johnson (JNJ),  Caterpillar  (CAT), and Colgate (CL) for the long haul. Let’s discuss.Dominant market positions and strong and dependable financials typically ensure the shares of blue-chip companies remain relatively steady amid market volatility. This feature makes them ideal bets for long-term investors who have relatively lower risk appetites. Given current market volatility on concerns over rising inflation, many investors are gravitating toward blue-chip stocks. This is evidenced by the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF’s (TCHP) 10.3% returns over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 6% gains.
Shares of blue-chip companies are typically favored in times of market volatility. Even though the United States and some other advanced economies have brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control, several economies continue to be severely affected by the deadly virus. Furthermore, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told CNBC on June 18 that he sees an initial interest rate increase happening in late-2022 as inflation picks up faster than anticipated. These factors could sustain market volatility in the coming quarters.
So, we think it could be wise to buy and hold shares of fundamentally-strong blue-chip companies Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). They have the potential to deliver steady returns over the long run based on their continuing product and business innovations.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>","Think global for post-Brexit City of London reform, top financiers say","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must focus on the City of London's global role when it comes to reforming financial rules after Brexit, senior finance officials said on Monday.
Britain is reviewing its financial rules for banks, insurers and markets after it fully left the European Union last December, largely severing the City's access to the 27-nation bloc.
Katharine Braddick, head of financial services at Britain's finance ministry, said reform will now focus on tailoring the rulebook better to circumstances in the UK.
""It's not about lower standards, it's about better targeted and really well informed standards,"" Braddick told City & Financial's City Week event.
Domestic-focused banks and insurers want simpler rules as a Brexit ""dividend"", but their peers in cross-border markets want to stick with global norms to avoid additional compliance costs.
Douglas Flint, chair of  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen asset manager and former chair of HSBC bank, said a ""change of language"" was needed to stop talking about a UK financial system when it comes to post-Brexit reforms.
""You want a respected regulatory system that is deeply plugged into international rulemaking,"" Flint said, adding that he wanted to see more political commitment to financial services.
""We have got to see ourselves as part of a global, international ecosystem rather than saying it's the UK system.""
""The City is a host to a global financial community, not its own system,"" agreed  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank CEO Jes Staley, adding that providing finance for climate-related projects globally would keep London ""relevant"".
David Schwimmer, CEO of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG), said Britain must remain committed to keeping its markets open, collaborative and outward looking by knocking down barriers to cross-border activity.
""We do want a City that is at the vanguard of innovation,"" Schwimmer said.

Allowing premium listings to have ""dual class shares"" to attract tech floats, and encouraging ""dark trading"" - off exchange dealings in shares - for big investors would keep London globally attractive, Schwimmer added.
Regulators having a dual responsibility for sector competitiveness and competition would also be ""something to look forward to"", said Flint.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian Air has sacked Chief Executive Jacob Schram who led the budget carrier through restructuring and said it was promoting Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen to the top job with immediate effect.
The board voted on June 20 to end Schram's 18-month tenure but the airline said he would support the carrier on a full-time basis during his notice period up to March 31.
""The board's decision to fire me came as a big surprise,"" Schram told Reuters.
His replacement, Karlsen, has been chief financial officer since 2018. For six months in 2019, he was acting CEO for the carrier, which is recovering from bankruptcy protection after the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the heavily indebted airline into a financial crisis.
""It'll be very exciting to see whether we can make this company profitable,"" Karlsen told Reuters. ""We have a unique opportunity now with Norwegian to create the company I have wanted for a long time.""
The survival plan ended Norwegian's long-haul business, leaving a slimmed-down carrier with Nordic and European routes.
The company declined to elaborate on Schram's departure but said his replacement was the right person for the job.
""Karlsen has successfully led the financial reconstruction of Norwegian and has the competencies, focus, trust and dedication that makes him the best choice as CEO of Norwegian,"" said Svein Harald Oeygard, the chair of Norwegian's board.
Karlsen's annual base salary will be 4.5 million Norwegian crowns ($521,000), unchanged from his CFO's wage, but he will also receive a performance based bonus and share options. The fixed salary was less than Schram's pay of 7.0 million crowns.
The board tussled with Schram over his severance package, which gives him the right to 15 months pay on top of the nine-month notice period, or 14 million crowns over 24 months.
""An effort has been made by the board to bring the severance payments to a level reflecting the challenges of the industry, but no agreement could be reached,"" Norwegian said.
Schram said he had been willing to make concessions to adjust his pay, but also said no agreement had been reached.
Bankruptcy courts in Oslo and Dublin last month gave their approval for Norwegian to sharply cut its debt by converting it to stock and to raise new capital.
The chair, Oeygard, was appointed in early June after those proceedings were completed and new equity capital was secured.

The search for a new CFO commences immediately.

Airlines UK said in a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps that fully vaccinated travellers from ""amber"" destinations should be exempt from the 10-day isolation requirement, while those coming from both ""amber"" and ""green"" countries should not need to have expensive PCR tests. 
""Given the incredible efficacy of vaccines and their critical role in easing domestic restrictions, we believe that the framework can safely be adjusted to provide a pathway for vaccinated people to travel without restriction, alongside steps to reduce restrictions for green and amber categories, making them more proportionate for travellers,"" the group said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that travellers would face hassle and delays this year if they sought to go abroad because the priority would be keeping the country safe from the coronavirus.
Data confirming that vaccines are more than 90% effective against hospitalisation from the fast-growing Delta variation should be considered when measures that apply to each tier of Britain's traffic light system for travel are reviewed on June 28, it said. 
""This effectiveness has been recognised by Europe, which is now opening its travel and leisure markets by introducing waivers from testing and isolation requirements for fully vaccinated persons, including arrivals from major markets such as the United States,"" it said. 
""Today 32 countries exempt travellers from quarantine and 27 from testing if fully vaccinated. The failure to adopt a similar approach risks the UK falling further behind the EU's reopening of international travel, including the critical trans-Atlantic market.""

Popular European holiday destinations for Britons, including Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, are currently rated ""amber"", which require returning passengers to take three COVID-19 tests and isolate for 10 days on return.
The 11 countries and territories rated ""green"" require two tests for passengers, including those who are fully vaccinated.

""A key focus of the investigation will be the operation of the App Store, as in many cases it empowers Apple to influence the operations of third parties,"" said Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO).

Further proceedings against Apple are also being considered with regard to complaints received about potentially anti-competitive practices, the watchdog said.
These include a complaint that Apple gives itself preferential treatment by pre-installing its own applications, the watchdog said.

After hitting its $4.75 all-time low on June 2, this meme stock soared to hit its $77.77 all-time high on June 10. The stock has gained 28.6% over the past month, but let’s find out if it has upside remaining given the FDA’s rejection of its Niemann-Pick treatment. Read on.Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, shares of relatively unknown biopharmaceutical company Orphazyme A/S (ORPH) soared to hit their $77.77 all-time high on June 10, 2021, on investors’ anticipation of FDA approval of the company’s lead pipeline candidate arimoclomol for the treatment for Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC).
The rally was primarily a result of retail traders’ investments that were driven by enthusiasm surrounding the stock on social media platforms such as Reddit. However, the company issued a notice on June 11 that the surge in its stock price was not related to any material change in its clinical development programs or financial condition and further warned its shareholders that they could lose a significant portion of their investments.
Indeed, the stock has declined 90.6% since hitting its all-time high, and by 40.8% over the past three months to close Friday’s trading session at $7.33. The decline can be attributed to ORPH’s announcement on June 18 that it failed to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval for the treatment of NPC. Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Zavesca is already approved to treat other lysosomal disorders, which could pose a threat to ORPH. ORPH’s poor profitability is evident from its negative values for ROE and ROA. So, we think ORPH’s near-term prospects look bleak.

PARIS (Reuters) - Traditional airlines need more time to recover before full competition for airport slots is restored, the head of Air France-KLM said on Monday, drawing a sharp response from Wizz Air counterpart Jozsef Varadi.
The suspension of the ""use-it-or-lose-it"" rule has allowed major carriers to preserve airport access during the coronavirus crisis despite the collapse in traffic, sparking protests from low-cost rivals keen to expand into once-congested airports.
Airlines were required to use 80% of pre-crisis take-off and landing slots or forfeit them to rivals. Major carriers are now pushing to extend a lower threshold and other accommodations through the coming northern winter season.
""It was logical to give airlines a break on the use-it-or-lose-it rule,"" Ben Smith said in a joint panel appearance with Varadi at the Paris Air Forum, adding that the time is not right for its return.
""We don't see our industry in a position yet to put that in place."" 
The Air France-KLM chief executive also cautioned against allowing budget rivals to ""take advantage"" of the crisis by expanding into crisis-hit national markets using crew on lower-cost foreign contracts.
But Varadi, founding CEO of Hungary-based Wizz, said the suspension of slot rules discriminated in favour of state-backed carriers and undermined the European single market. France recently raised its stake in Air France-KLM to 28.6%.
""This is the level of nationalism playing into the game nowadays,"" Varadi said. ""It's not only governments getting involved on the equity side of the industry but (also) protecting that investment through various administrative measures, like slots.""
Varadi warned of similar political reflexes in areas such as environmental tax and he clashed again with Smith on European moves to require a minimum percentage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which has lower carbon emissions but higher costs.
The Air France-KLM boss echoed warnings from established airlines that said the application of the so-called SAF mandate to long-haul routes would end up benefiting non-European rivals.
""We don't want to be put in a position where it alters the level playing field between ourselves and other long-haul carriers,"" Smith said.
But Varadi said moves to make intercontinental travel exempt ignore the bigger picture and also pose a serious threat to fair competition.

""Are we responsible for the environment or not?"" the Wizz CEO said, urging a ""seamless and non-discriminatory"" approach to green fuel.
""It shouldn't be another way of further distorting the market by putting legacy carriers in a better situation.""

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>",Vivendi faces investor test over plans for Universal spin-off,"PARIS (Reuters) - French media group Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) will seek investor support on Tuesday to spin off its prized Universal music business, a plan criticized by activist funds for benefiting top shareholder Vincent Bollore more than smaller investors. 
The world's biggest music label, home to pop stars such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, is valued at 33 billion euros ($39 billion) by Vivendi, or more than the group's own market value. 
While the spin-off looks set to clear a first hurdle with backing at the June 22 shareholder meeting, a backlash is brewing over the transaction's structure and Vivendi's secretive governance. This has set the scene for a stand-off between Bollore and some investors who hope to pressure the group to yield more cash or provide clarity over its long-term plans. 
The stakes are high, including for investors who plan to take a direct slice of Universal Music Group (UMG). 
William Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, a special purpose acquisition vehicle, has signed a deal to buy 10% of the music business. A consortium led by Chinese giant Tencent already has a 20% chunk.
Bollore, Vivendi's controlling shareholder with 27%, is seeking to cash in by listing UMG in Amsterdam, and distributing 60% of Universal's shares to Vivendi investors.
U.S. investment fund Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM), which has declined to comment on the size of its stake in Vivendi, opposed the distribution structure earlier this month and said that the sale of chunks of UMG ahead of its listing was detrimental to minority shareholders.
EXTRA CASH DIVIDEND
However, the spin-off has already won some investor backing, with proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS advising a vote in favor and Norway's $1.35 trillion sovereign wealth fund, with a 1.49% stake in Vivendi, saying it would back the resolution. 
Even activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners, which has also publicly questioned the spin-off, said it would give it the thumbs up.
""We will vote in favor of the spin-off because this is happening and no one will be able to stop it,"" said Giuseppe Bivona, a partner at Bluebell. 
But Bluebell, which is asking for an extra cash dividend of around 3 billion euros to make the deal more attractive, has along with proxy advisors taken aim at another proposed resolution, which would allow Vivendi to buy back and cancel its shares for up to 50% of its capital. 

The fund has questioned whether it could allow Bollore to increase his stake in Vivendi without making a tender offer. Bollore's family-owned group pledged that it will not request an exemption to file a tender offer on Vivendi's shares if it crosses the 30% threshold in capital ownership.
Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), which owns a substantial stake in Vivendi, has not publicly said whether it would support the Universal spin-off or not.

The world's two largest aircraft leasing companies are seeking to create a new financing giant which would be the largest buyer of jetliners built by planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The deal will reshape a global air finance industry that has attracted a flood of capital in recent years as investors look for higher returns. 
AerCap requested EU approval on Friday.

The EU competition enforcer can approve the deal with or without concessions or it can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns.
Analysts said the scale of the combined entity, controlling about three times the number of aircraft as its nearest competitor, Dublin-based Avolon, could force AerCap to offload aircraft to meet antitrust demands.

1030,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>",Grocery-Store Boom Is Poised to Live On Even as Pandemic Fades,"(Bloomberg) -- Supermarket prices are rising, and restaurants are reopening. But Americans keep stocking up on groceries.
Grocery sales accelerated in late May and early June, according to Nielsen data cited in a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note. That’s despite restaurant revenue growth turning positive in April for the first time during the pandemic. Meanwhile, supermarket prices are up 15% on average versus before Covid-19. More than a third of Americans said they’re still buying more groceries in the first quarter of the year, with only 8% saying they’re purchasing less, according to a survey from researcher Jungle Scout.
The situation has confounded analysts, who expected robust grocery-store sales to diminish as the year progressed and as vaccinated Americans returned to offices, restaurants and travel. It can’t be explained by inflation, because grocers are also returning to their normal practice of discounting, which partially offsets the price hikes they’re taking elsewhere. Sales of groceries on a unit level, which exclude the effects of inflation, have held steady.
“This is surprising given the economy reopening,” Simeon Gutman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in the note. “And, we think, to the market as well, which has bid grocer stocks up.”
Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. is the latest beneficiary of the trend, as the company boosted its full-year sales and profit forecasts on June 17 thanks to better-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. The beat and raise sent its shares up the most in almost five months. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., the nation’s biggest grocer, and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) have also enjoyed brisk food sales this year.
Two-thirds of people said they’re buying the same number of grocery items weekly as they did during the height of the pandemic, according to a survey conducted this week by market researcher CivicScience for Bloomberg News.
“People still continue to eat at home more than pre-Covid,” Kroger Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said on a call with analysts. In a survey Kroger conducted of its customers, 92% said they enjoy cooking the same or more than they did before the pandemic. “They still continue to cook more than pre-Covid, and they’re buying more premium products.”
Online Options
One reason for the sustained lift in grocery sales is that online ordering has made it easier for shoppers to buy more, with curbside pickup and home delivery removing the hassle of lugging items through the store and checkout. Around one quarter of adults said they do all or most of their food shopping via e-commerce, up from 14% last year, according to Coresight Research.
Another catalyst for food sales is a greater sense of preparedness instilled by last year’s lockdowns, when many essential items were hard to find. Keeping pantries more fully stocked than normal reflects “some underlying caution and perhaps some ingrained habits from prolonged stay-at-home behaviors,” Gutman said.
It might not last, though, as the reopening continues to expand. New York and California just lifted most of their Covid-19 restrictions last week, so much of the pent-up demand for spending in restaurants and other places outside the home is yet to emerge.
Households also have plenty of essential items left in their cupboards. The most stockpiled items that U.S. adults are still working through are paper products like toilet paper or paper towels, a survey conducted last month by Morning Consult for Bloomberg News shows. More than a quarter of Americans said they stocked up on canned soups and dried foods at the start of the pandemic and still have some left.
“As we move into the coming months, you will see a gradual improvement in travel and leisure spending, and that will come at the expense of the food retailers,” Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones, said by phone. “If you’re starting to eat out more, and you’re still buying five bags of rice, at some point you don’t have room for it.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will lay out plans to boost the spending power of its research-focused pharmaceuticals business at an investor day on Wednesday, as analysts call on the British drugmaker to boost drug development prospects with takeovers or alliances.
New GSK, the pharma business to be separated from its consumer product operations next year, will cut dividend payouts and shift some debt to the consumer unit, leaving scope for investments to revive its sluggish stock market performance.
GSK's share price has fallen 14% over the past 12 months versus a 5% rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index, hit by a lack of fast-growing products and as patients deferred treatments due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The company is the world's largest vaccine maker by sales, but has fallen behind rivals such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in the race to develop a shot against the coronavirus. 
Luke Miels, chief commercial officer at GSK, told Reuters that the market was underestimating the company's value ""both in terms of our growth prospects with the products that we have in the market now, and also our (drug development) pipeline"".
The company said in April it was looking at partnerships and deals with drug and vaccine developers, particularly in immunology and genetics.
Miels said key trial read-outs are due over the next two years, though it will take longer to see results from a more fundamental upgrade of research and development (R&D), gunning for therapy breakthroughs rather than incremental improvement.
""I think what we need to do is to give (investors) more confidence on commercial execution and give them more confidence on the quality of the assets in the pipeline,"" said Miels.
GSK's track record this year has been sobering. In oncology, compounds bintrafusp alfa and feladilimab, previously touted as potential billion-sellers, fell through in trials.
The loss of patent exclusivity on HIV drug dolutegravir looms at the end of 2027, with about 3 billion pounds in annual sales expected to vanish.
""Given the recent failures in the mid-stage pipeline... supplementing the internal R&D pipeline via additional collaborations or acquisitions makes strategic sense,"" Berenberg analysts wrote in a note.
ONE BECOMES TWO
Expectation around the investor day has grown since a report in April that activist investor Elliott Management has taken a large stake in GSK. There has also been speculation about the future of Emma Walmsley, chief executive since 2017 and former head of the consumer products division.
GSK, whose consumer products include brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Advil pain killers and Nicorette gum, has a market valuation of more than 70 billion pounds ($97 billion), and a separately listed pharma business would be expected to be one of Britain's bigger companies in its own right.
Analysts say the separation of the consumer products division, a joint venture with U.S. pharmaceuticals group  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), could take the form of an initial public offering, with proceeds going to the innovative pharma business.
GSK has said the consumer products business will take on net debt worth 3.5 to 4 times its annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). That is up from 2 times for all of GSK currently.
The pharma business in turn will have lower debt.
""Post-separation, the balance sheet will be in a stronger position to execute on larger transactions should the opportunity or need arise,"" said Louise Pearson, an analyst at brokerage Redburn.
To give itself even more financial wiggle room, GSK has flagged dividends will be cut from next year, with analysts projecting a reduction to about 40% of earnings, down from more than 80% this year.
""Continued investment in the pipeline ahead of (the 2022 split) is anticipated as management must convince the market that the Pharmaceuticals business can live without Consumer Healthcare,"" Berenberg said.
Much will ride on trial results expected this year and next, including for a combination therapy with cancer drug Blenrep, for experimental anaemia treatment daprodustat to ease chronic kidney disease, and for novel antibiotic gepotidacin against urinary tract infections.

""Hopefully over the next couple of years the changes in R&D will be more visible and reflected in the share price,"" said Miels.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Investors eye a high mark in U.S. profit growth as inflation fears deepen,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking ahead to an expected spike in June-quarter profits and the outlook for future economic growth to support a record-high stock market that has many traders fearing a selloff. 
For second-quarter earnings, which begin next month, analysts are expecting a 64% jump over a year ago, the biggest increase for any quarter since the financial crisis in 2009, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But investors may be difficult to impress after the first-quarter's blowout results, with many fretting about inflationary pressure that could push the Federal Reserve toward raising interest rates.
With inflation worries rising, investors will keep a close eye on the impact of higher input costs on profit margins. 
Hotter-than-expected inflation fears hit the market this week after the Fed hinted it could tighten monetary policy sooner that many investors anticipate.
The next earnings season is still weeks away, but there is a good chance that results will be even stronger than current estimates, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York. 
""Right now companies are able to pass on all of the higher input costs to their customers, so profit margins are under no pressure at all,"" he said, noting if earnings are likely to surprise to the upside, price-to-earnings ratios ""are likely overstated."" 
The S&P 500 is up 11% in 2021, near record highs. Yet the index is trading at 22 times forward earnings, below the 23.5 times at the start of the year, according to Refinitiv.
Many companies raised their second-quarter estimates during the first-quarter profit season, Nick Raich, CEO of the Earnings Scout, wrote in a note.
""While it is still too early to know for sure, it does appear that the positive earnings momentum will persist in the 2Q 2021 period"" and into the second half of 2021, he wrote.
Next year's outlook is less clear. S&P 500 earnings are currently projected to increase 36.5% in 2021 and 11.7% in 2022, according to Refinitiv.

Investors have flocked to areas of stocks that tend to benefit the most from economic growth since the recovery from the pandemic began last year, but the issue has become ""how sustainable will growth be,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
""There are concerns about what Q1 and Q2 of next year will look like,"" he said. ""Perhaps that reflation trade has gotten ahead of itself, and I think that's the message you're seeing from markets right now.""

Verdi said it was organising the three-day strike as part of a long-running battle with the U.S. tech giant in Germany over better pay and working conditions.
""The workers in the mail order centres have to cope with the rush of customers and don't get a cent more for the additionally intensified workload,"" said Verdi representative Orhan Akman in a statement.
Germany is Amazon's biggest market after the United States, and the Verdi union has been organising strikes at Amazon in the country since 2013 to protest low pay and poor conditions.
An Amazon spokesperson said the company offers excellent pay and benefits. It has said during past calls for strikes over 90% of employees in the logistic centres worked as normal.
Earlier this month, Amazon said it will guarantee an entry-level wage at its German warehouses of 12 euros ($14.25) an hour from July, which will rise to at least 12.50 euros per hour from autumn 2022. 

Amazon holds Prime Day to boost summer sales. The member-only discounts are an important way Amazon markets Prime, a fast-shipping and media-streaming service that incentivises subscribers to do more shopping on Amazon.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after last week’s hefty losses on hopes that this week's comments from Federal Reserve speakers will show that last week's sell-off was overdone..

Investors are having to adjust their positions after a hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve, with the central bank’s policy makers, in the form of a dot plot, indicating the likelihood of interest rate rising in 2023, a year earlier than expected.
“With the Fed dots having done so much damage to positioning, the focus for the week ahead will be on a host of Fed speakers - and whether they're as hawkish as the dots suggest,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who stated Friday that he saw higher interest rates as early as 2022, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) are all expected to deliver remarks later Monday. 
Most eyes, however, will be on Fed Chairman Jay Powell, who is due to testify Tuesday on the central bank’s emergency lending programs and current policies before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday and there are no noteworthy earnings reports, but the retail sector is likely to be in focus as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) annual Prime Day starts.
The two-day sales event generated $10.4 billion in gross merchandise sales for the e-commerce giant last year, and has been brought forward from its traditional July date.
Also in the spotlight will be Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Industries, after the conglomerate accepted an offer from CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) to the tune of $2.1 billion. 
Crude oil prices pushed higher Monday, helped by a pause in Iranian nuclear talks, delaying the resumption of crude exports from the Persian Gulf country into the global market.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.3% at $71.52 a barrel, while Brent was up 0.2% at $73.64.
Helping the tone Monday has been the adjournment of talks between Tehran and the western powers, and the U.S. in particular, over reviving the 2015 nuclear deal after the election of hardline judge Ebrahim Raisi as Iran’s new president.
Raisi is on the U.S. sanctions list for human rights abuses and Tehran insists penalties must be removed if the nuclear pact is to be revived, a move that the U.S. is likely to resist.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Monday it has launched a program to help make it easier for staff overseeing Boeing (NYSE:BA) and other airplane manufacturers to report safety concerns.
An independent survey released in August found FAA safety employees said they faced ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised concerns the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
The survey gave ammunition to critics who argued in the aftermath of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that the FAA had not done enough to insulate employees from industry pressure.
The FAA said on Monday the new program for the 7,400 employees in its Aviation Safety office will allow them to report confidentially any safety concerns without fear of punitive action.
The office oversees manufacturers, airlines, maintenance providers, aviation medical practitioners and flight crews.
""We can never be satisfied with the status quo when it comes to safety, and the free exchange of vital information is a cornerstone of safety and continual improvement,"" said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson in a statement.
""We want our employees to know that when they speak up, they can be sure someone is listening.""
The survey, conducted in late 2019 and early 2020, quoted one anonymous FAA employee as saying there was a message of, ""Don't rock the boat with Boeing.""
Reuters reported in August that the FAA was moving to create a Voluntary Safety Reporting Program - a confidential ""non-punitive environment that encourages open reporting of aviation safety issues and concerns."" 
The FAA said it worked closely with union leaders on how to structure the new program.
""The more we can continue to encourage people to report, the more we can influence the safety in the system,"" Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which represents engineers and other Aviation Safety employees, said in a statement.
In December, Congress passed sweeping legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes. It also boosts FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requires disclosure of critical safety information and provide new whistleblower protections.
The 737 MAX was grounded for 20 months after two crashes in five months killed 346 people.

A House of Representatives report released in September said the two fatal 737 MAX crashes ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""
The FAA's top safety official Ali Bahrami announced June 2 he would retire effective June 30. Bahrami had faced criticism from some U.S. lawmakers and family members of those killed in the 737 MAX crashes. Officials said it was Bahrami's decision to step down.

CNH is offering $58 for each share, 50.2% higher from Raven’s closing price on Friday. CNH shares were flat in premarket trading.
Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2021 and Raven shares will no longer be traded on the exchange once the deal is complete.
The two companies have had a long-standing relationship and the deal is expected to enhance CNH’s position in the global farm equipment market by adding Raven’s competence in autonomous and precision agriculture technology.
CNH does not expect the proposed acquisition to have any impact on its guidance for 2021.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>","Macau beefs up casino rules, more than doubles number of gaming investigators","HONG KONG (Reuters) - The world's biggest casino hub of Macau will shake up its casino regulator by more than doubling the number of gaming inspectors and restructuring several departments in its latest move to ramp up supervision.
The executive council that advises Macau's chief executive announced proposals to boost the number of inspectors to 459 from 192 now, as well as creating a new director-level post at the regulator.
The regulations will take effect once published in the city's official gazette, the council said on Friday in a statement on the government's website, with local media saying it was likely to be within a few weeks. 
The change comes just months before the expiry of multi-billion-dollar casino licenses that will require operators Sands China (OTC:SCHYY),  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF), MGM China (OTC:MCHVY), SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF), Melco Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment to rebid for new gaming concessions.

A Chinese special administrative region, Macau has massively tightened scrutiny of casinos in recent years, with authorities clamping down on illicit capital flows from mainland China and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.
Beijing has also intensified a war on cross border flows of funds for gambling, affecting the financing channels of Macau's junket operators and their VIP casino customers. Macau has struggled with a dearth of travellers because of coronavirus curbs since the start of 2020. While gambling revenues have picked up in recent months, they are less than half the 2019 figure.

Investing.com -- With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) share values already down more than a third since their peak in January, 42% of U.S. investors believe that Tesla’s market cap will continue dropping this year, according to a new Investing.com survey.
The survey showed that 25% of respondents believe Tesla share values will rise before the end of 2021 to a price close to the January highs, and 17% anticipate a finish to the year that exceeds the stock’s previous peak.
Investors’ prognosis is more optimistic in the long run, with 30% saying the stock price will land between $1,000 and $2,000 two years from now, 17% projecting an $800-1,000 value and 11% expecting a value of $2,000-$3,000.
“The insane run-up in the price of the stock over the last decade is, like all investments, a bet on the future,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.
“As such, it helps to be comfortable with roller coasters if you want to buy Tesla stock. That’s because volatile price swings have become a hallmark of the stock’s performance over the years.”
The survey reveals the influence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with over 60% of investors believing him to be the most influential personality around when it comes to financial markets. A minority of respondents, yet still a striking 33%, agreed that Musk has built up Tesla stock’s price based on “fantasy” as opposed to “revolutionary vision.”
Perhaps more telling, however, was that almost 60% of Tesla investors are more loyal to the CEO than to the company itself.
“As one of the leading innovators in the auto industry, Tesla has generated a lot of interest from retail traders in recent years,” Cohen said. “It has developed a loyal cult-like following from fans and enthusiasts who believe in the company’s technology and often laud Musk with praise, devotion and admiration.”
“However, at the same time, the company has many vociferous critics who argue the electric vehicle pioneer could go bankrupt in the years ahead due to its soaring debt and high cash burn.”
Delving into Musk’s recent influence within the cryptocurrency space, the poll asked respondents if the Tesla chief’s manipulation of cryptocurrency values has changed their view of that investment. 51% agreed that Musk “has too much power” and 40% said that cryptocurrencies in general “are too volatile.” 24% don’t believe Musk has too much influence over cryptocurrencies, while only 12% said his influence makes them “more confident about digital currencies.”
52% of investors expressed support for policies that would reduce the power of big influencers such as Musk when it comes to manipulating financial markets.
The June poll was conducted online and gathered responses from 1,103 U.S. investors."

American Airlines said the move would bring additional resilience and certainty to its summer operations. 
""(We) feel these schedule adjustments will help ensure we can take good care of our customers and team members and minimize surprises at the airport,"" the company said in a statement.
The airline said its cancellations were targeted at impacting the smallest number of customers ""by adjusting flights in markets where we have multiple options for re-accommodation.""
The announcement was first reported by the WSJ.
Airlines and other transportation operators have seen a quick ramp up in demand as U.S. COVID-19 vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions lifted in recent weeks.

According to data from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, nearly 50 million airport passengers were registered in May, up 19% from April. So far in June, the TSA has registered nearly 35 million air passengers.
American Airlines said the incredibly quick ramp up of customer demand also came at a time when bad weather caused multi-hour delays over the last few weeks, disrupting flight and crew work hours. The company said some of its vendors were also struggling with labor shortages, impacting the airline's operations.

Investing.com -- Shares of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) were down nearly 3% in Monday’s premarket trading after more than 90% of China’s Bitcoin mining capacity came to an abrupt halt over the weekend
According to the state backed Global Times newspaper, many Bitcoin mines in Southwest China's Sichuan Province - one of China's largest cryptocurrency mining bases - were closed amid an intensifying nationwide crackdown against cryptocurrency mining.
Sichuan is China's second-biggest bitcoin mining province and the country accounts for more than half of global bitcoin production.
Bitcoin extended its weekend losses and was down 8% to trade around $32,500-levels. Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD were also down 8% each. Polkadot pDOTn/USD shed 12%.
The Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission, and the Sichuan Energy Bureau issued a joint notice Friday demanding the closure of 26 suspected cryptocurrency mining projects by Sunday, Reuters said.
The notice ordered state electricity companies in Sichuan to conduct inspections and make corrections. They are to immediately stop supplying electricity to cryptomining projects they have detected.
Some industry players had hoped that regulators in Sichuan, where hydropower is abundant, could take a softer approach. But the latest ban underscores Chinese regulators' determination to curb speculative crypto trading to control financial risks, Global Times said.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",China Evergrande plans to repay $1.5 billion bond due June 28 this week - source,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's most indebted property developer Evergrande Group plans to repay its $1.47 billion offshore bond maturing next Monday this week, ahead of schedule, a source close to Evergrande said.
In recent weeks some of the bonds of Evergrande and its subsidiaries have sold off on rising investor concerns over the developer's ability to make timely payments. This pushed the yields on two separate 5.8% 2025 onshore bonds to above 29.5% from around 11.5% earlier in June, according to Refinitiv.
Evergrande declined to comment whether it would repay the bond early, but it said it had sufficient funds to repay the bond due next Monday.
Shares of the Hong Kong-listed developer, which have been under pressure in the past few weeks, extended gains to as much as 10% on Monday to an almost one-week high after the Reuters report. The stock closed 9% up at HK$10.80. 
Earlier this month, Evergrande said it was arranging payment for some of its project companies' commercial paper that had not been repaid on time.
Evergrande and its subsidiaries have outstanding bonds worth $28.1 billion, according to Refinitiv data, including the bond due on June 28.
SCRAMBLING FOR CASH
Earlier in the day, smaller peer Calxon said in a filing that controlling shareholder Evergrande will sell more than half of its stake worth $386 million, in a move that will enhance Evergrande's cashflow.
DSB analyst Danielle Wang said investors were worried Evergrande would not have cash available offshore to repay the bond, as the developer had not issued dollar bonds for a while, so an early bond repayment would help boost its share and bond prices. 
She added that if the yields on other Evegrande bonds drop to normal levels after this repayment, it would enable the company to issue new dollar bonds and pay back the more expensive onshore bonds, helping its cashflow. 
In a research note earlier this month, DBS said risks remain in Evergrande's 214 billion yuan ($33 billion) short-term bank loans maturing or repricing in the second half of this year, as banks are under regulatory pressure to trim exposure to the real estate sector. 
The developer has been scrambling for cash to meet the new regulatory requirements on debt ratios, including raising funds with its various units and selling some of its residential units at steep discounts.
Company chairman Hui Ka Yan said early this month the company's debt will drop to below 600 billion yuan by the end of June, near its year-end target of 560 billion yuan, and achieving one of the three debt ratio caps set by regulators.

AgBank is the first major state bank to make a public statement against cryptocurrencies after China's State Council, or cabinet, last month vowed to crack down on bitcoin trading and mining activities.
Following a recent meeting with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Agbank said it would conduct due diligence on clients to root out illegal activities involving cryptomining and cryptocurrency transactions.
If a client is found to be involved crypto trading, its account would be immediately shut, and relationship cut, the lender said in the statement. 
Bitcoin's bull run globally had revived speculative trading in China, where people buy cryptocurrencies using yuan via bank accounts or payment platforms. Last month, three industry bodies issued a ban on crypto-related financial services. 
AgBank also cautioned clients against crypto fraud, and asked them to report illegal activities, according to the statement, which was later deleted from the bank's website.

As China ramped up its campaign against cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, bans on cryptomining have been issued in major bitcoin mining hubs, including Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.
China has also blocked a slew of cryptocurrency-related social media accounts, and barred the search for major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Huobi on baidu.com and Twitter-like platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).

1049,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",Porsche to Make High-Performance Battery Cells in Germany,"(Bloomberg) --
Porsche AG will develop and produce battery cells for electric sports cars in a new joint venture with a German lithium-ion specialist, taking a hands-on role in expanding its technological edge.
The carmaker is investing a high double-digit million euro sum in Custom Cells GmbH and will control a 83.75% stake in the Cellforce venture, according to a statement. Small-scale production is slated to start in 2024 and the German state will contribute about 60 million euros ($71 million) in funding.
“The battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,” Porsche Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume said in the statement Monday. The new subsidiary will play a major role in researching, developing, producing and selling high-performance cells, he said.
Traditional carmakers are stepping up their expertise in battery technology to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and attract customers with improved driving range, performance and charging time. Batteries for sports cars need to cope with high temperatures and be capable of fast-charging and effective energy recuperation.
The new cells will allow charging in less than 15 minutes, Blume said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag published Sunday. The brand’s Taycan model currently needs 22 1/2 minutes to charge the battery to 80% from 5%, he said.
Porsche will use silicon as anode material for higher energy density and more compact batteries. BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) has been tapped as a development partner and will supply cathode materials. The new factory outside Stuttgart will have an annual capacity of at least 100 megawatt hours, enough to make cells for about 1,000 sports cars a year. The initial workforce of 13 people will be expanded to as many as 80 by 2025.
Porsche development chief Michael Steiner said the company will continue to test its battery technology in motorsports, with experience from the race track helping to refine technology for the Taycan that was introduced in 2019.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s most profitable brand added a more spacious version of the Taycan to its lineup this year and anticipates more than 80% of global deliveries will be fully or partly electric in 2030. The Taycan may soon eclipse Porsche’s 911 model in global sales, and a fully electric version of the best-selling Macan SUV is due to hit showrooms in 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45% by 2030 to have any hope of meeting Paris Agreement targets for the middle of the century and averting catastrophic warming.
Yet 41 of the world's 250 biggest corporate emitters - or 16% - are only just starting to assess their emissions, with no reduction targets set for any year, an analysis of data from research firm Signal Climate Analytics found.
And while many of the 250 companies have set targets for 2050, only 27 - or 11% - have laid out shorter-term plans to make major cuts by 2030, according to the data, compiled from corporate reports and other public disclosures.
This refers to reductions to their biggest source of emissions, often from the use of their products, or so-called Scope 3 emissions.
The 250 companies together account for more than a third of global emissions. Many campaigners say it is crucial for big polluters to set such interim targets so that authorities can gauge and drive global progress towards the Paris goals.
To try and accelerate action, the G7 group of wealthy nations this month backed moves to force companies to disclose their exposure to climate-related risks, raising pressure on them to put a plan in place to mitigate them.
""Without more incentives for 80% of the companies in these key sectors to disclose basic plans, we are unlikely to have the information necessary for markets and regulators to act constructively,"" said Tim Nixon, chief executive of data research firm Signal Climate Analytics.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice's (CD&R) pursuit of British supermarket group Morrisons has set up an intriguing clash of former Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) colleagues.
Morrisons, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain by sales behind market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, on Saturday rejected a proposed 5.5 billion pound ($7.6 billion) cash offer from CD&R.
The offer was described by Morrisons as far too low, but British takeover rules give CD&R until July 17 to come back with a firm offer.
CD&R is being advised by Terry Leahy, the man who transformed Tesco into Britain's dominant supermarket group and the world's third-largest retailer as chief executive for 14 years to 2011.
The private equity firm's offer pits him against Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and CEO David Potts, two of Leahy's closest lieutenants at Tesco.
Higginson spent 15 years on Tesco's main board, first as finance and strategy director and later as CEO of the company's retailing services business before leaving in 2012.
Potts joined Tesco as a 16-year-old shelf-stacker before working his way up to become CEO of Tesco's Irish business, its UK retail stores business and then CEO of Tesco Asia.
He left in 2011 after being passed over for Leahy's job.
That job went to Philip Clarke, who was sacked in 2014, shortly before an accounting scandal plunged Tesco into its biggest crisis, raising questions over Leahy's legacy and tarnishing his reputation.

Potts and Higginson are not the only Tesco alumni to have ended up at Morrisons.
Finance chief Michael Gleeson and Trevor Strain, Morrisons' chief operating officer and the hot favourite to succeed Potts, were also at Tesco during the early stages of their careers.

Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint Stock Bank, Saigon - Hanoi Commercial Joint Stock Bank and SeABank would make the interest-free loans this month and early next month, the Lao Dong newspaper cited the central bank as saying.
Vietnam Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The airline, which is 86% owned by the government, reported a net loss of 4.97 trillion dong in the first quarter.
State media last week cited the Ministry of Planning and Investment as saying the airline would likely make a net loss of 10 trillion dong in the first half of this year and was on the brink of bankruptcy.

Vietnam Airlines earlier this month said it would sell 11 Airbus A321 aircraft through an auction.

""Working closely with Northvolt will also allow us to strengthen our in-house development capabilities,"" said Håkan Samuelsson, chief executive at Volvo Car Group. 
Northvolt will become Volvo Cars' exclusive battery cell production partner in Europe.
The gigafactory will be powered by clean energy and is expected to employ around 3,000 people. The location of the plant has yet to be decided.
Northvolt raised https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/battery-maker-northvolt-raises-275-bln-expand-factory-2021-06-09 $2.75 billion in equity this month to expand capacity at the factory it is building in northern Sweden, and Volvo plans to source battery cells from that battery plant starting in 2024.
German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is Northvolt's biggest shareholder and the battery maker has also got contracts worth billions from the likes of BMW and Scania.
Battery makers are scrambling to keep up with demand as carmakers switch to electric in order to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions. 

Volvo Cars aims to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade, and by 2030 it aims to sell only fully electric cars.
Electric successor to Volvo's XC60 model will be the first car to feature battery cells developed through the joint venture.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Dubai Airshow, this year's biggest aerospace trade show and a spectacle for business deals worth billions of dollars, will be held under capacity restrictions in November due to the coronavirus pandemic, its organiser said.
Even though few deals are expected as the industry seeks to preserve cash, the show is seen as a psychological boost for airlines and planemakers to reset an industry battered by the health crisis. 
It will also take the temperature of regional conflicts and tensions between the United States and Iran.
The Dubai Airshow, scheduled for Nov. 14-18, will be the largest aerospace trade event to be held since the pandemic forced the cancellation of European shows Farnborough and Le Bourget in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
It is a magnet for tens of thousands of visitors including planemakers, their suppliers, airlines, arms firms and military officials from around the world. Over the years it became a key industry summit as state carriers like host Emirates reshaped international travel through their Gulf hubs.
Timothy Hawes, managing director of organiser Tarsus F&E, said the number of exhibitors who had signed up for this year's show was so far the same as when it was last held in 2019.
""We are confident as we stand at the moment that the interest is there,"" Hawes told Reuters in an online interview.
The five-day show in 2019 welcomed over 84,000 visitors and 1,200 exhibitors, according to the organiser.
Exhibition stands are to be spread further apart from each other this year than in previous shows to maintain distancing between attendees, Hawes said.
Stands and the show as a whole will also have limits on how many visitors can be in attendance at any single moment, he said. However, those limits fall within previous attendance levels.
Wearing of masks is expected to be compulsory.
""We are very much ready to showcase and bring people together again. It's been a long time of people (not) meeting face-to-face,"" Hawes said.
A decision had yet to be made on whether attendance would be limited to those vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or those who had recently tested negative for CVOID-19, he said.
""We expect that as it stands there is an opportunity to run a show without it looking too different to previous years.""

The show will also feature Israeli companies after the UAE and Israel last year established ties which has since led to a number of business deals including in the aerospace sector.
The UAE, with a population of about 9 million people, has one of the world's highest rates of COVID-19 vaccinations. It is currently reporting around 2,000 new infections each day, down from a peak of almost 4,000 in February.

The bank is to offer companies in Britain cash management services such as payment processing and payroll as it continues to grow in the country having launched its retail brand Marcus there in 2018.
Goldman Sachs said its transaction banking business in the United States has attracted more than 250 clients since June last year, taking in more than $35 billion in deposits and processing trillions of dollars through its systems

Britain is proving a popular place for U.S. banks to expand, with JPMorgan gearing up to launch a digital bank in the country. Last week it bought British roboadvisor Nutmeg which will form the basis of its retail digital wealth management offering internationally.

""As announced, the transaction is based on an enterprise value of 35 billion euros ($41.55 billion) for 100% of UMG's share capital,"" Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) said. 
UMG, which is being spun-off by France's Vivendi, will complete its planned Euronext Amsterdam listing in late September, the media group said. 
Tontine said it will distribute UMG shares to its shareholders only after the completion of listing. ""Promptly following the completion of the listing and the effectiveness of the registration statement, the UMG shares acquired by PSTH will be distributed to our shareholders."" 
Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, is planning to cash in on its UMG crown jewel by spinning off the entity to existing shareholders.
Earlier this year, the consortium led by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd purchased an additional 10% stake in UMG making the total equity stake controlled by the Chinese tech giant to 20%. 
""The arrival of major American investors provides further evidence of UMG's global success and attractiveness,"" Vivendi said.
Tontine said it will continue to exist as RemainCo after the transaction with an access to about $2.9 billion in cash and intends to pursue a business combination with an operating business promptly.
The blank-check firm, in its statement, pointed to UMG's operating profit growth of more than 20% per annum since 2017 and analysts' estimation of operating profit of 1.5 billion euros ($1.78 billion) for 2021.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Monday morning. Investors turned away from the reflation trade thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s surprise hawkish turn in its latest policy decision.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.27% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.04%. The People’s Bank of China set its loan prime rate earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.66%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 3.59% in its biggest slide in more than a month. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.09%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 slid 1.85%, after the release of May retail sales figures earlier in the day.
U.S. shares fell, with the benchmark S&P 500 retreating during the previous session. Commodities such as copper also dropped as the dollar climbed to a two-month high.
Investors continue to digest the impact of the Fed policy decision, handed down during the previous week. A flattening U.S.Treasury yield curve was also indicative of retreating reflation bets, with the benchmark 10-year yield declining to 1.42% and the 30-year rate falling below 2%.
Shorter maturity yields climbed upwards, however, after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said inflation risks may warrant higher interest rates in 2022. A slew of Bullard's colleagues, including Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB), are also due to speak throughout the week.
Investors will also be looking to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. Powell will update the committee on the Fed’s COVID-19 emergency lending and its asset purchase programs.
“The shift toward tapering and a pull forward in first rate hikes may cause bouts of nervousness in markets with shares vulnerable to a decent correction,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said in a note.
“But note that tapering is not monetary tightening, it’s just slower easing and rate hikes are still a fair way off in most developed countries,” the note added.
In other central bank news, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will address the European Parliament later in the day, while the Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
Meanwhile, oil climbed to about $72 a barrel. Talks to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal hit the pause button after Ebrahim Raisi won a landslide victory in Iran's presidential election during the previous week."

(Reuters) -Australia's Boral (OTC:BOALY) Ltd said it would sell its North American building products business to a unit of NYSE-listed  Westlake Chemical  (NYSE:WLK) Corp for $2.15 billion, throwing a spanner in the works of a takeover bid by Seven Group.
Boral's shares rose as much as 4% to A$7.06, their highest since October 2018, after the building and construction materials supplier revealed its deal to sell the U.S.-based business in a disclosure responding to Seven's bid. 
Boral had already asked shareholders to reject an off-market zero premium bid by Seven Group, a conglomerate controlled by Australian media owner Kerry Stokes, saying it undervalued the company.
Seven owns 23.18% of Boral, and made the offer in May after failing to raise its stake to 30% due to regulatory setbacks. 
Seven Group said the business had been sold for a loss in a rushed response to their offer. 
""Our view is that Boral should have secured more. This business has been outperforming while the Australian business is under-performing,"" a Seven spokesperson said in an email. 
One analyst said the U.S. deal would not have a great impact on Seven's takeover attempt. 
""Seven Group made a bid that was expected to get turned down to clear the way for them to keep buying more,"" said Mathan Somasundaram, CEO at Deep Data Analytics.
""Seven Group's historical trend in these scenarios suggests that they will get as much as they are allowed and stay there as a blocking stake. When the cycle turns weak, they will move in and take control gradually,"" he said. 
Boral's shares have surged more than 30% this year, as monetary and fiscal stimulus helped Australia's property market rebound from last year's pandemic lows. 

Boral CEO Zlatko Todorcevski said the company expected significant surplus to be returned to shareholders from the sale, with its net debt target falling from A$1.5 billion to A$1.3 billion.

CD&R now plans to wait to gauge investor reaction and signs of any political pushback before deciding on its next steps, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.
The board of Morrisons will seek assurances from any potential buyer on the future of its workforce, manufacturing and pensions as the supermarket group prepares for rival bids, the Times newspaper reported https:// on Monday.
The move from CD&R could spark a bidding war from rival private equity firms or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has an online partnership with the grocer, the Times said. 
The Labour Party warned on Sunday that a private equity acquisition of Morrisons, Britain's fourth biggest grocer, would put jobs at risk, but it is unlikely that the government would look to intervene, the Times added. 

CD&R and Morrisons did respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Morrisons had rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pound ($7.62 billion) cash offer from CD&R on Saturday, saying it was far too low.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2021 08:16PM ET</span>","In Indonesian banking, rise in religious conservatism ripples across sector","By Gayatri Suroyo and Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - A rise in religious conservatism in Indonesia is drawing talent away from what some view as un-Islamic jobs in banking, industry professionals say, creating hiring woes for conventional banks but a boon for the country's fledgling sharia finance sector.
The trend comes amid broader societal change in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, driven by millions of young, 'born-again' Muslims embracing stricter interpretations of Islam. [https://reut.rs/3aMab6D]
Reuters spoke to a dozen industry sources over how concern about Islamic law barring exploitative interest payments, known as ""riba"", is reverberating through the world of Indonesian finance.
Since 2018, hiring for banks and fintech companies in peer-to-peer lending, payments and investment platforms has been more challenging, said Rini Kusumawardhani, a finance sector recruiter at Robert Walters Indonesia.
""Roughly speaking 15 out of 50 candidates"" would refuse a job within conventional banking and peer-to-peer lending, she told Reuters. ""Their reason was quite clear-cut. They wanted to avoid riba."" 
Islamic scholars do not all agree on what constitutes riba. Some say interest on a bank loan is an example, but others say that while such loans should be discouraged, they are not sinful.
""It's so common that the stigma is if one borrows it's identical with riba,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a webinar on the Islamic economy earlier this year. ""But loans are allowed in the Koran as long as they're taken carefully and they're recorded correctly.""
Islamic banking accounts for just over 6% of the roughly $634 billion assets in Indonesia's banking industry - but has seen tremendous growth in recent years. Savings in Islamic banks jumped 80% from end-2018 to March 2021, outstripping the 18% growth in conventional counterparts, while financing also grew faster than conventional loan growth.
WORSE THAN ADULTERY
Exactly how many have left Indonesia's conventional banking sector is unclear. Statistics show a gradual employment drop, but this may also reflect digitalisation or coronavirus pandemic-related layoffs. 
As of February, there were 1.5 million people overall employed in finance and the sector offered Indonesia's third-highest average salary, government data showed. The sector employed 1.7 million in 2018.
For 36-year-old Syahril Luthfi, finding online articles labelling riba as ""tens of times more sinful than committing adultery with your own mother"" was enough to persuade him to quit his conventional bank job and move to an Islamic lender, he said.
Concerns over the issue have helped create online support groups for former bankers, including XBank Indonesia, which claims nearly 25,000 active members on a messaging platform and has an Instagram account with half a million followers.
Its chairman, El Chandra, said in an email the community was founded in 2017 to support those facing challenges quitting a financially supportive, but un-Islamic job.
""To decide to quit a riba-ridden job is not easy, many things must be taken into consideration,"" said Chandra, who said some branded those who quit as stupid or radical. 
XBank Indonesia advises people against taking out mortgages and other loans. But it's hard to measure the impact on demand for banking products among the so-called ""hijrah"" movement of more conservative young, middle-class Indonesians now embracing Islam - many already didn't use banks to the extent Western peers might.
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES
Sunarso, president director of Indonesia's biggest lender by assets, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), acknowledges people had left jobs at financial institutions he has worked at for religious reasons. 
However, he views the hijrah trend as an opportunity for sharia finance, explaining how it determined a decision to merge the Islamic banking units of BRI and two other state-controlled lenders in February to form the country's biggest Islamic lender, Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI).
BSI's chief executive Hery Gunardi told Reuters it planned to cater to the growing community of more religious millennials in a bid to double its assets.
In fintech, some startups have also been trying to align with Islam, to tap a bigger slice of Indonesia's multi-billion dollar internet economy.
Dima Djani, founder of Islamic lending startup ALAMI, expects Islamic financial products to really take off in two to three years as the hijrah movement matures, impacting people's ""lifestyle, their looks, their food and their travel"" as they learn more about their religion.

""But in the end, as they continue to learn and shift their behaviour ... they will shift their finances,"" added Dima, who previously worked at foreign banks. He said due to high demand, he planned to expand ALAMI into an Islamic digital bank later this year.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Fed shift causes rally in value stocks to wobble,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve's hawkish shift is forcing investors to reevaluate the rally in so-called value stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days after ripping higher for most of the year. 
Shares of banks, energy firms and other companies that tend to be sensitive to the economy’s fluctuations have tumbled following the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank surprised investors by anticipating two quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2023 amid a recent surge in inflation.
The Russell 1000 Value Stock Index is down 4% from its June peak, though still up 13.2% this year. Its growth counterpart is up 9.1% year-to-date. 
One factor driving the move is the idea that a Fed more strongly focused on preventing the economy from overheating may begin unwinding easy-money policies sooner than previously expected. On Friday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank’s shift was a ""natural"" response to economic growth and inflation moving quicker than expected, bolstering that view.
“Value stocks had gotten ahead of themselves, particularly in energy and financials, and the folks that are caught offsides are starting to unwind those trades,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
The post-Fed meeting slide in value has been accompanied by a retreat in some commodity prices, a surge in the dollar and a rally in U.S. government bonds that dragged down yields on the benchmark U.S. Treasury to around 1.44% on Friday afternoon.
Investors will be keeping a close eye on next week’s economic data for clues on whether the recent surge in inflation -- which saw consumer prices accelerate at their fastest pace in 12 years last month -- will persist. 
New home sales and mortgage applications are due out June 23, while May consumer spending numbers are expected on June 25.
Investors piled into value stocks in the latter half of 2020, as signs of breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19 bolstered the case for a powerful economic rebound in 2021. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by nearly 7 percentage points since the start of November 2020, bucking a trend that saw technology and other growth sectors regularly outshine value over the last decade. 
An unwinding of the heavy positioning in value shares could exacerbate the recent slide. Mutual funds are overweight value names to a larger degree than any time in the last eight years, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report published on June 9. 
Some big-name investors such as Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund last year, have suggested that growth stocks will resume their market outperformance as investors rotate away from value sectors such as energy that are up 38.5% since the start of the year. [L2N2NQ273] Wood’s flagship ETF is down 4.8% year-to-date.
Others, however, believe the recent wobble in value stocks is a pause, rather than a turning point. 
Cyclical companies remain the least over-valued in the U.S. stock market, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). High sales-growth companies are trading at valuations nearly double their 10-year averages, while cyclical companies are trading at valuations approximately 40% more than their historical levels, he wrote in a research note.
The prospect of rising interest rates should also benefit higher quality value stock names that held up better in last year's downturn but have lagged during the recovery, said John Mowrey, chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group. 
He has been increasing his positions in utility and consumer staples stocks that have underperformed value stocks as a whole, betting that they will increase their dividend payouts, which would make them more attractive even if Treasury yields eventually rise. 

Among his holdings are consumer companies  Church & Dwight  (NYSE:CHD) Co, which is down 4% for the year to date, and McCormick & Company (NYSE:MKC) Inc, which is down 9.7% for the year to date.
""The idea of dividend growth has been largely sidelined because we’ve all been enjoying stock appreciation,"" he said. ""We think this will be the next leg of the value stock rally.""

Travel companies, whose finances have been stretched to breaking point during the pandemic, are desperate to avoid another summer lost to COVID-19. But with Britain's strict quarantine requirements still in place that now looks likely. 
As the clock ticks down to July, Europe's biggest airline Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group on Thursday launched legal action to try to get the government to ease the rules before the industry's most profitable season starts.
On Wednesday, June 23, pilots, cabin crew and travel agents will gather in Westminster, central London, and at airports across Britain to try to drum up support. 
Britain's aviation industry has been harder hit by the pandemic than its European peers, according to data published by pilots trade union BALPA on Sunday.
That showed daily arrivals and departures into the United Kingdom were down 73% on an average day earlier this month compared to before the pandemic, the biggest drop in Europe. Spain, Greece and France were down less than 60%. 
UK airports were also badly affected, with traffic in and out of London's second busiest airport Gatwick down 92%, according to the data.
The government had to balance the risks of foreign holidays bringing new variants of the virus into Britain, justice minister Robert Buckland told the BBC. Public Health England official Susan Hopkins said people should predominantly holiday at home this summer while the population is vaccinated.
But time is running out for the industry, said the union. 
""There is no time to hide behind task forces and reviews,"" said BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton.

""BALPA is demanding that the UK Government gets its act together and opens the U.S. routes and European holiday travel destinations that it has blocked with no published evidence at all.""
Over 45,000 jobs have already been lost in UK aviation, with estimates suggesting that 860,000 aviation, travel and tourism jobs are being sustained only by government furlough schemes.

The partnership with Customcells, a company in southern Germany specialising in lithium-ion cells, will aim to produce car batteries with higher energy density than prototypes used in Porsche's current electric cars, the company said in a statement.
European carmakers are pushing to reduce their dependence on Asia for batteries as they roll out all-electric models to meet stricter emissions targets in the European Union.
In addition to cutting charging time, improving energy density will mean reducing the amount of raw material needed in batteries to achieve the same range. It will also cut battery production costs, making electric cars more affordable.
Porsche said it will invest a high double-digit million euro sum in the joint venture in which it will hold 80%.
The production facility aims to have a capacity of 100 kilowatt hours, which will translate into about enough batteries for 1,000 cars a year.
Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume said in April the company wanted to speed up its e-mobility drive with plans for a German factory in Tuebingen to manufacture battery cells. At that time he did not say if Porsche would seek a joint venture partner.

Customcells is based in Tuebingen.
Porsche's parent company Volkswagen has said it plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants across Europe and expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles globally.

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Morrisons has rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pound ($7.62 billion) cash offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), saying it is far too low.
Britain's fourth largest grocer by sales after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda, said it received the ""unsolicited, highly conditional non-binding"" proposal of 230 pence a share on Monday.
The board of Bradford, northern England-based Morrisons rejected the proposal on Thursday.
""The board of Morrisons evaluated the conditional proposal together with its financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, and unanimously concluded that the conditional proposal significantly undervalued Morrisons and its future prospects,"" the group said in a statement on Saturday.
Shares in Morrisons, down 5.5% over the last year, closed on Friday at 182 pence, valuing the group at 4.33 billion pounds.
Morrisons said CD&R's proposal provided for Morrisons shareholders to also still receive a final ordinary dividend of 5.11 pence per share announced on March 11.
CD&R had earlier on Saturday said it was considering a possible cash offer for Morrisons.
Under British takeover rules CD&R has until July 17 to announce a firm intention to make an offer.
APPETITE FOR SUPERMARKETS 
CD&R's approach underlines private equity's growing appetite for UK supermarket assets, attracted by their cash generation and freehold assets.
In February, Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital purchased a majority stake in Asda from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in a deal valuing the UK supermarket group at 6.8 billion pounds.
That deal followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda after an agreed deal was blocked by Britain's competition regulator in 2019.
Morrisons has a partnership agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and there has been speculation it could emerge as a possible bidder.
A formal bid from CD&R could involve Terry Leahy, the former Tesco CEO who is a senior adviser to CD&R.
When at Tesco, Leahy was the boss of Andrew Higginson and David Potts, who are now Morrisons' chairman and CEO respectively.
Morrisons, unique among British supermarket groups in making over half of the fresh food it sells, trades from about 500 stores and has 118,000 staff, making it one of the country's biggest private sector employers.
In March, the group reported a halving of annual profit due largely to costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, but forecast a bounce back in the 2021-22 year.

Earlier this month, Morrisons was rebuked by investors over executive pay, with more than 70% of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting rejecting its pay report.

(Reuters) - Long-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc executive and president Jerome Guillen, who left the company earlier in June, has sold an estimated $274 million worth of shares after exercising stock options since June 10, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The filing, which was submitted to the SEC on Tuesday, said that Guillen expected to sell 215,718 shares for $129 million that day, and that he offloaded 145,289 shares worth $89.6 million on June 14, and 90,111 shares worth $55 million on June 10. 
Guillen, a former Mercedes engineer who was with Tesla since 2010, oversaw the company's entire vehicles business before being named president of the Tesla Heavy Trucking unit in March. He left the company on June 3.
The departure of Guillen, one of Tesla's top four leaders, including Chief Executive Elon Musk, has sparked market concerns about Tesla's future vehicle programs like the Semi electric truck and new batteries called 4680 cells. 
Gordon Johnson, an analyst at GLJ Research, estimated that Guillen has cut his exposure to Tesla from 1.3 million shares a weak ago to about 150,000 as of Friday. 
“Should TSLA be on the verge of technological and autonomous breakthroughs and breakout 2Q21E deliveries/earnings, as well as EV domination, why has what many assumed was the second most important person at the company (i.e., Jerome Guillen) sold $274mn worth of TSLA stock,"" he said in a report. 
""It could raise some eyebrows for investors,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said, adding that investors are going to watch closely to see if he sells more. 

Stock options give employees and executives the right to buy their company's stock at a specified price for a certain period of time. When share prices rise above the exercise price, they can buy the stocks at discounted prices. 
It was not immediately known how much Guillen paid to exercise the options.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>","Apple Daily editor, CEO denied bail in Hong Kong","By Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Two executives of Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, charged under a national security law, were denied bail on Saturday in a case that has drawn international condemnation and stoked fears over media freedoms in the financial hub.
Editor-in-chief Ryan Law 47 and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung 59 were among five Apple Daily executives arrested on Thursday when 500 police also raided the outlet's newsroom, which authorities described as a ""crime scene.""
Police said on Thursday dozens of the newspaper's articles were suspected of violating the national security law. It was the first case in which authorities have cited media articles as potentially violating the contentious legislation. 
Law and Cheung, who are charged with ""collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security"" appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Saturday and were denied bail by Judge Victor So. 
They will next appear in court on August 13. 
The pair are accused of colluding with Apple Daily owner and staunch Beijing critic Jimmy Lai between July 1 2020 and April 3 April 2021 to request a foreign country, person or organisation ""to impose sanctions or blockade or engage in other hostile activities against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or the People's Republic of China,"" according to a charge sheet. 
The National Security Law came into force in Hong Kong just before midnight on June 30, 2020. 
Judge So said Law and Cheung were denied bail because there was insufficient evidence to believe they would not endanger national security.
Under the security law, the onus is on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.
As part of their bail application, Law and Cheung had offered to resign their roles at Apple Daily, not speak to media and foreign politicians and pay cash bail - HK$3 million ($386,463.47)for Cheung and up to HK$200,000 for Law. 
Three companies related to Apple Daily that are also being prosecuted for collusion with a foreign country appointed people to represent them in court. Authorities have frozen HK$18 million ($2.32 million) of the companies' assets.
The other three executives arrested on Thursday, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Puiman and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai, were released on bail late on Friday, according to Apple Daily.
""We will still publish the newspaper tomorrow. We will try our best to keep running,"" said Chan, who attended Saturday's hearing and was speaking outside the court after bail had been denied. 
Earlier on Saturday, crowds had gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing, some holding yellow umbrellas or wearing Apple Daily T-shirts saying, ""No fear, fight on."" 
The National Security Law punishes what Beijing broadly refers to as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The arrests and scale of the Apple Daily raid have been criticised by Western nations, global rights groups, press associations and the chief U.N. spokesperson for human rights. 
Apple Daily and its listed publisher Next Digital have come under increasing pressure since Lai was arrested last year under the legislation.
Lai, whose assets have been frozen under the security law, is already in jail for taking part in unauthorised assemblies and awaiting trial in his national security case.

As investigations into Apple Daily and its senior executives ramp up, some employees and observers have expressed deepening concern over the newspaper's future.

RENTON, Wash. (Reuters) -Boeing Co's 737 MAX 10, the largest member of its best-selling single-aisle airplane family, took off on its maiden flight on Friday, in a further step toward recovering from the safety grounding of a smaller model.
The plane completed a roughly 2-1/2-hour flight over Washington State, returning to Renton Municipal Airport near Seattle at 12:38 p.m. 
The first flight heralds months of testing and safety certification work before the jet is expected to enter service in 2023.
In an unusual departure from the PR buzz surrounding first flights, the event was kept low-key as Boeing (NYSE:BA) tries to navigate overlapping crises caused by a 20-month grounding in the wake of two crashes and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Boeing's 230-seat 737-10 is designed to close the gap between its 178-to-220-seat 737-9, and Airbus's 185-to-240-seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the narrowbody jet market, worth some $3.5 trillion over 20 years.
However, the market opportunity for the 737 MAX 10 is constrained by the jet's range of about 3,300 nautical miles (6,100 km), which falls short of the A321neo's roughly 4,000 nm. 
Boeing must also complete safety certification of the plane under a tougher regulatory climate following two fatal crashes of a smaller 737 MAX version grounded the model for nearly two years - with a safety ban still in place in China. 
Boeing has carried out design and training changes on the MAX family, which returned to U.S. operations in December.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said the company is producing about 16 737 MAX jets a month at its Renton factory. 
Boeing is working on safety enhancements for the 737 MAX 10, including for its air data indication system and adding a third cockpit indication requested by European regulators of the ""angle of attack,"" a parameter needed to avoid stalling or losing lift. Deal’s comments were provided to the media via a pool reporter inside a Boeing aircraft delivery center. 
""We're going to take our time on this certification,"" Deal said. 
While the smaller MAX 8 is Boeing's fastest-selling jet, slow sales of the MAX 9 and 10 models have put Boeing at a disadvantage to the A321neo.
Boeing has abandoned plans to tinker with the 737 MAX 10 design, but is weighing a bolder plan to replace the single-aisle 757, which overlaps with the top end of the MAX family.
Even so, Boeing says it is confident in the MAX 10, and it is stepping up efforts to sell more of the jet, with key targets, including Ireland's Ryanair. 
Customers include United Airlines with 100 on order. Although sources say United is weighing a new order for at least 100 or even up to 200 MAX, its requirement for large single-aisles will be served by Airbus - reinforcing the market split.

The flight, watched by dozens of employees but virtually no visitors as Boeing sought to downplay the event, showcased a revamped landing gear system illustrating an industry battle to squeeze as much mileage as possible out of the current generation of single-aisles. 
It raises the landing gear's height during take-off and landing, a design needed to compensate for the MAX 10's extra length and prevent the tail scraping the runway on take-off.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 07:01PM ET</span>","Dow, S&P post worst week in months after hawkish Fed spooks investors","By David French
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 posting their worst weekly performances in months, after comments from Federal Reserve official James Bullard that the U.S. central bank might raise interest rates sooner than previously expected spooked investors.
The blue-chip Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 started the week at record closing levels, but ultimately fell by their most in any week since late October and late February, respectively.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also closed lower despite posting its two highest ever finishes in the last five days.
Investor confidence in their existing positions was initially dinged by the Fed's policy meeting, where it projected interest rate hikes would happen sooner than anticipated, and signaled it was reaching the point where it could begin talking about tapering its massive stimulus - as opposed to just thinking about it.
This was compounded by Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, saying Friday he was among the seven officials who saw rate increases beginning next year to contain inflation.
Inflation, and how the U.S. central bank will tackle it as the country comes out of the pandemic, had been front-and-center of investors' minds in the run-up to the policy meeting, which ended on Wednesday.
""I'm not surprised to see the market sell off a little bit. I'm never surprised, given the strong run we've had for such a long period of time, when you see some periods of profit-taking,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, closed Friday at a four-week high.
""Next week, you will have various Fed governors give speeches, and we'll have the same thing: some governors will be more hawkish, and some will be more dovish, so you'll see some back-and-forth,"" Ghriskey added. 
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 533.37 points, or 1.58%, to 33,290.08, the S&P 500 lost 55.41 points, or 1.31%, to 4,166.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 130.97 points, or 0.92%, to 14,030.38.
The U.S. dollar strengthened after Bullard's comments, pushing the index which tracks the greenback against six major currencies to its highest level since mid-April.
While U.S. crude prices - which traditionally suffer from a strong dollar - initially fell on Friday, they rebounded after OPEC sources said the producer group expected limited U.S. oil output growth this year. [O/R]
The upward commodity move didn't translate into positive sentiment for U.S. energy stocks, with the sector's index the worst performer on the day. The utilities and financials indexes also fell by more than 2%.

Friday was also ""quadruple witching day,"" the quarterly simultaneous expiration of U.S. options and futures contracts. It was the largest options expiration in history, noted Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.97 billion shares, compared with the 10.96 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 06:41PM ET</span>","Exxon, union try new approach to resolve increasingly bitter dispute","By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) hope to break an increasingly bitter dispute over a Texas refinery contract next week by taking a different approach of sending one negotiator each to contract talks instead of a whole team, company and union officials said on Friday.
Exxon seven weeks ago locked out 650 union workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery and lubricants plant after failing to reach agreement on a new contract. On Thursday, negotiators met for only the second time since the lockout but failed to make any headway and stopped talks after about two hours.
Talks have turned fractious. The union has accused Exxon of trying to dissolve seniority provisions, colluding to break the union and falsely claiming the union's seniority terms are unique. 
After Exxon tweeted the job-seniority terms it wanted were no different than those at the company's Baytown, Texas, refinery, local 13-2001 union President Ricky Brooks called the tweet ""factually untrue."" 
Exxon said the USW has failed to negotiate seriously on its proposal. ""We expect the union to come prepared to bargain in good faith,"" the company said ahead of Thursday's talks. 
The USW has filed a complaint with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming Exxon violated labor laws by improperly monitoring employees and used company resources to launch an effort to dissolve the union. 
An employee has circulated information to gain support for a petition to decertify the USW local that represents Beaumont workers, according to the NLRB complaint. Exxon told employees seeking information to contact its human resources department or the NLRB. A vote can be called if 30% of covered employees sign a petition and file it with the NLRB.
""We continue to meet and bargain in good faith with the union,"" said Exxon spokeswoman Julie King. ""The company has at all times acted lawfully and will continue to do so.""

In another sign of tensions, the USW this month filed a federal lawsuit in Houston claiming Exxon refused to accept an arbitrator's decision involving two workers. 
The lawsuit asked the U.S. court to enforce a ruling calling for two union workers fired from its Baytown refinery to be reinstated and given back pay.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>","Fed update weighs down Wall Street, adds fuel to the dollar","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -All three main indices on Wall Street dropped Friday with investors wary of a more hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, while the dollar posted the strongest gains in over a year and oil prices continued a steady climb. 
After starting the week near record highs, U.S. stocks have steadily dropped since Fed officials projected Wednesday that interest rates may rise sooner than previously expected. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 533.37 points, or 1.58%, marking the worst week for the blue-chip index since January. The S&P 500 lost 55.41 points, or 1.31%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 130.97 points, or 0.92%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 8.87 points or 1.24%.
Stocks were trending downward after the Wednesday policy update from the Fed, but that decline became sharper after Friday morning comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he thought the Fed could raise rates as soon as next year.
Those comments were offset somewhat later in the day by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who said he didn't see interest rate hikes until 2024.
The Fed maintained it planned to keep up unprecedented monetary support until the jobs market had fully recovered, and that any acceleration of a stimulus exit is due to the strong gains expected from the U.S. economy coming out of the pandemic.
But the prospect of earlier interest rate hikes helped nudge investors away from a stock market that had been near record highs at the start of the week.
""I'm not surprised to see the market sell off a little bit. I'm never surprised, given the strong run we've had for such a long period of time, when you see some periods of profit-taking,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
The Fed stance provided fuel to the U.S. dollar, as the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, jumped 0.43% on Friday to 92.314, its highest price since mid-April. The index is on pace for its strongest weekly gain in roughly 14 months, as investors seek some safety in the dollar from other currencies after a light surprise from the Fed.
Oil shook off earlier losses to add to its recent gains following reports OPEC expected limited U.S. oil output growth this year. 
Brent crude futures rose 43 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $73.51 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 60 cents, or 0.8%, to $71.64 a barrel. Both benchmarks were headed for a weekly gain of about 1.1%.
""Despite a complete return to pre-pandemic life in the US, energy companies are cautious over keeping their balance sheets in order and will remain disciplined over making commitments over new wells,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. ""The oil market does not have to worry about oversupply concerns anytime soon and that is keeping crude prices supported despite a broad selloff with commodities.""

Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell Friday as the bond market absorbed the Fed news, with the yield curve flattening on the bet the Fed will move more quickly to tackle persistent inflation pressures. The benchmark 10-year notes were last at 1.445%. [US/]
The Fed took its toll on safe-haven gold this week. Spot gold was down 0.61% to $1,762.63 per ounce, with prices down roughly 5.7% on the week. U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% down at $1,769 an ounce.

However, its lofty valuations are not in sync with its fundamentals. So, it’s better to bet on established and fundamentally-sound software companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and VMware (NYSE:VMW) to cash in on industry tailwinds.Being one of Reddit favorites, shares of software company BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) soared to hit its 52-week high of $28.77 on January 27, 2021. In fact, the stock rallied 103.8% year-to-date and 59.1% over the past month. However, BB is currently trading at an expensive valuation which doesn’t justify its fundamentals. In terms of forward EV/EBITDA, BB’s 159.50x is 835.3% higher than the industry average of 17.05x. Its forward P/CF of 75.06x is 227.3% higher than the industry average of 22.93x. So, they could be due for a pullback.
While BB may not be a good bet right now, the solid growth prospects of the software industry owing to increasing demand for advanced software in almost every industry should drive the performance of many fundamentally-sound software stocks in the near term. According to Grand View Research, the global business software and services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% between 2021 and 2028.

The growth potential of this industry should allow low-priced stocks such as United Microelectronics (UMC) and Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) to grow in the near term.The global semiconductor shortage is a grave challenge faced by countries worldwide, as the low supply is creating negative spill-over effects in the majority of tech-savvy industries. As a result, governments and corporations alike are spending heavily on this industry to expand the total production capacity.
President Biden’s proposed infrastructure plan includes a provision of $50 billion investment to revive the American semiconductor industry. Comparatively, the European Union announced its aim to boost its chip production to account for 20% of the global output by 2030, while South Korea recently announced a $452 billion investment in this industry over the next nine years. On the corporate front, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, has responded to this shortage by increasing its capital spending budget to $28 billion in 2021.
Such investments should boost the production, and thereby supply of semiconductors globally. According to Statista, the global semiconductor industry is expected to grow 11% year-over-year in 2021. Moreover, the Semiconductor Industry Association projects the annual global sales to increase 19.7% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2022.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at nearly one-month lows Friday as St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard spooked the market after making a case for an earlier-than-expected rate to keep handle on inflation. 
S&P 500 fell 1.37%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.58%, or 553 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.92%.
Bullard, a non-voting Fed member, said he expected the first rate hike by the end of the 2022, earlier than the Fed’s current projections, which indicate lift in 2023.
“I put us starting in late 2022,” Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC. ""[M]y forecast said 3% inflation in 2021 -- core PCE inflation -- and 2.5% core PCE inflation in 2022."".
""To me, that would meet our new framework where we said we’re going to allow inflation to run above target for some time, and from there we could bring inflation down to 2% over the subsequent horizon,"" he added.
The Fed's fingerprints - with a helping effort from fiscal stimulus - were all over the recent rally, and now that the central bank is looking to drain the well of stimulus, growth will slow -- and risk markets are taking note. 
""Investors are already grappling with the notion that the economy has been propped up markedly, thanks to monetary and fiscal support, but now market participants must accept the fact that the time has come to begin to remove – or at least talk about removing – the punch bowl, returning the economy to more organic means,"" Stifel said in a note.
""[In] the absence of trillions in spending and record low rates, no matter how solid the fundamentals, the economy is poised to slow from a more robust profile at the start of the year looking out to 2022 and beyond.""
The week ahead promises to deliver yet more talk on tapering and inflation as several Fed members are slated to speak.
The hawkish talk from the Federal Reserve hasn’t spooked bond prices as yields, or rates, slipped.
The slip in rates took some by surprise, but it likely signals that the bond market is backing the Fed’s call that inflation will be transitory.
The move in bond yields is “more likely the bond market is buying into the Fed’s notion of inflation-dismissal rhetoric; the Fed has been clear it expects the recent bout of inflation to prove temporary, and as we move to the end of the year and into 2022, price pressures will expectedly ease,” Stifel added.
Banking stocks bore the brunt of the move in lower in rates, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) closing lower, and the latter down more than 3%.
Tech, usually a fan of falling rates, failed to take advantage of the move lower, though it did outperform relative to other sectors. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended below the flatline.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, are set for a second-weekly loss, falling nearly 4% even as the oil prices remained firm.
In other news,  Smith & Wesson  Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI) jumped more than 17% after hiking its dividend by 60% and approving a $50 million stock buyback following better-than-expected quarterly results."

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell again Friday, as St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard forecast that the central bank could hike rates sooner than expected to keep a hold on inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 1.14%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.4%, or 458 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.03%.
Bullard, a non-voting Fed member, said he expected the first rate hike by the end of the 2022, earlier than the Fed’s current projections, which indicate lift off to occur in 2023.
“I put us starting in late 2022,” Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC. ""[M]y forecast said 3% inflation in 2021 -- core PCE inflation -- and 2.5% core PCE inflation in 2022."".
""To me, that would meet our new framework where we said we’re going to allow inflation to run above target for some time, and from there we could bring inflation down to 2% over the subsequent horizon,"" he added.
The Fed will start to drain the well of liquidity before lifting rates, however, with some on Wall Street betting that the central bank could begin to taper its monthly bond purchases by year-end.
The week ahead promises to deliver yet more talk from the Fed on tapering and inflation as several Fed members are slated to speak.
The hawkish talk from the Federal Reserve hasn’t spooked the bond prices as yields, or rates, slipped.
The slip in rates took some by surprise, but it likely signals that the bond market is backing the Fed’s call that inflation will be transitory.
The move in bond yields is “more likely the bond market is buying into the Fed’s notion of inflation-dismissal rhetoric; the Fed has been clear it expects the recent bout of inflation to prove temporary, and as we move to the end of the year and into 2022, price pressures will expectedly ease,” Stifel Economics said in note.
Banking stocks bore the brunt of the move in lower in rates, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) falling more than 2%.
Tech, usually a fan of falling rates, failed to take advantage of the move lower in rates, though did fare relative to other sectors/ 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were below the flatline.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, are set for second-weekly loss, falling more than 1% even as the oil prices remained firm.
In other news,  Smith & Wesson  Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI) jumped more than 16% after hiking its dividend by 60% and approving a $50 million stock buyback following better-than-expected quarterly results."
1090,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 03:10PM ET</span>",PayPal overhauls U.S. rates as payments rivalry heats up,"By Anna Irrera and David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.
The strategic shift reflects PayPal's growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.
The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.
""We are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,"" Dan Leberman, PayPal's senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.
""The wallet is of tremendous value; the card processing is commoditized.""
PayPal shares were up 2.5% late Friday afternoon.
PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.
The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.
PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.
It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.
""PayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.""
Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.
In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.
Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.
""We think it's a bold price to come out with,"" he said.
As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.
The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015.
Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).
For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.
PayPal's business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. It processed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.

""It's more than just pricing,"" said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. ""They are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.""
""Especially post pandemic, that has become very, very important.""

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 03:01PM ET</span>",U.S. companies rush to change their calendars for new Juneteenth holiday,"(Reuters) -U.S. companies scrambled to put in place policies that would allow employees to take a day off after President Joe Biden signed a bill late on Thursday to recognize June 19, or ""Juneteenth"", as a federal holiday.
Juneteenth has been a holiday in some U.S. states, but the move has pressured more companies to declare the day a holiday. With Juneteenth, the first new federal holiday created in nearly four decades, falling on a weekend, some companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), have allowed U.S. employees a floating day off. 
Many U.S. companies had observed Juneteenth last year, when the United States was rocked by protests against racism and policing following the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a Minneapolis police officer.
More than 800 companies said they would offer employees a paid day off for Juneteenth as of Friday morning, said Hella Creative, which started an online signature campaign for firms recognizing the holiday.

Retailer  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) said the day would remain an annual company holiday moving forward, while it would be a paid holiday at  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP).  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) said it would close all U.S. operations, like it did in 2020. 
Coffee chain  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) said its stores would remain open, but hourly workers would be paid at 1.5 times their regular rate and salaried staff will receive a holiday in lieu.

Preliminary findings of an independent investigation presented on Wednesday showed the collapse of a section of the Metro 12 Line was caused by a structural failure.
The line was built by a consortium of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's Grupo Carso, Mexico's ICA, and French trainmaker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA.
""We want them to participate in the rehabilitation in economic terms. That is part of what we are proposing,"" Sheinbaum said at a news conference, without giving details of whether the firms would be asked to only rebuild the collapsed section or the whole line.
The Civil Engineering Corps of Mexico said on Thursday that after a physical inspection of the metro line it found evidence of other deficiencies and vulnerabilities that require further analysis.

Sheinbaum said she had spoken by phone this week with representatives of ICA and Grupo Carso and would be talking shortly with Alstom. She plans on meeting with company representatives in person next week.
ICA and Grupo Carso did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 02:54PM ET</span>","Bank of America Makes Juneteenth a Holiday, Joining JPMorgan, Wells Fargo","(Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). joined JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in closing branches and offices for Juneteenth starting next year after President Joe Biden signed the federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S. into law.
The banking giants told U.S. employees they’ll receive a floating paid day off to mark the occasion this year, with June 19 falling on a Saturday. The companies both will add Juneteenth to their regular holiday schedules starting next year, they said in memos to their staffs, with bank branches and other facilities closed the day the federal holiday is observed.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. is observing Juneteenth as a federal holiday starting in 2022, and “will provide additional information” on its closing plans later, a spokesman said.
While banks making Juneteenth a holiday is key “from a symbolic perspective, it is an important reminder that much work needs to be done in the 21st century to make sure that all the vestiges of slavery are eradicated in our lifetime,” said Dorothy Brown, an Emory University law professor and former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banker. “Do they promote diverse employees? Do they put diverse employees on the biggest deals?”
Most government workers will be granted paid time off Friday. The Federal Reserve Board’s offices in Washington will be closed Friday, while its financial services operate normally. The central bank said earlier that it will “determine how to adjust our schedule to reflect the new federal holiday in the years to come.” The Securities and Exchange Commission also said its offices will close.
The same won’t be true for the financial markets. Before deciding whether to close, U.S. exchanges -- primarily the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq -- rely on input from several participants including banks, broker-dealers and regulators. The Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association, an industry trade group, said it won’t recommend that fixed-income markets close as the Fedwire settlement system will remain open.
Any decision about whether to make Juneteenth a market holiday “will be part of our annual calendar review during which we consult with stakeholders,” Katrina Cavalli, a Sifma spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), the world’s largest futures exchange, will follow Sifma’s lead, a spokeswoman said. The holiday also falls on a weekend in 2022.
At Bank of America, the company is “honoring Juneteenth with broad, robust resources to empower employees to continue our courageous conversations” and to “take action as a company and a catalyst for others in support of racial equality and economic opportunity,” it said in a memo Friday.
JPMorgan “is committed to putting an end to discrimination of any kind, against any group, anywhere it exists in society today,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Brian Lamb, the bank’s global head of diversity and inclusion, said in a company memo Thursday. “This week’s milestone serves as reminder for each of us to rededicate our actions to the pursuit of equality for every community.”
Paid Holiday
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). told employees last year that they could take an extra paid “Heritage Day” holiday each year on a day of their choosing, in coordination with their managers, including Juneteenth.
“The celebration of Juneteenth also serves as a reminder of the hard work that remains to address the terrible legacy of slavery,” Sara Wechter, Citigroup’s head of human resources, said in a memo to U.S. staff Thursday. “Today, and every day, our Citi team is working to build a more equitable society for all.”
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) also will give U.S. workers a floating paid holiday. A  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) spokeswoman said the firm told employees they can step away from work at midday Friday, urging them to “consider taking time for any activities that are meaningful to you.”
The legislation to make June 19 a federal holiday had long languished in Congress, but it gained more support after the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer last year. Floyd’s death set off a flurry of actions on Wall Street to respond to racial inequality in the country and within its own ranks.
While recognition of Juneteenth is “a good first step,” there is a risk that banks are “just checking a box,” said Bevon Joseph, co-founder of the Greenwood Project, which works to get minority students into the financial industry.
“The holiday is becoming part of the historical narrative,” Joseph said. “That’s a great thing. But, again, where is the action?”
U.S. markets are sometimes slow to catch up with Congress. While Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday became a federal holiday in 1983, it took 15 years for the major exchanges to close in observance.
Juneteenth marks the day when enslaved African Americans were ordered to be freed after Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, three years after the emancipation proclamation. Momentum for the holiday built quickly through the week, after the Senate passed the legislation without dissent on Tuesday and the House followed with a 415-14 vote the next day.
The law had long been championed by Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, in addition to Democrats. Cornyn has sponsored a resolution to commemorate Juneteenth every year since 2011. He co-sponsored legislation to make the date a federal holiday last year, but it was blocked by Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, who objected to the cost of giving federal workers another paid holiday.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google's adtech business set to face formal EU probe by year-end - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google could face its biggest regulatory threat, with EU antitrust regulators set to open a formal investigation into its lucrative digital advertising business before the end of the year, said people familiar with the matter.
It would mark a new front by the EU competition enforcer against Google. It has in the last decade fined the company more than 8 billion euros ($9.8 billion) for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising. 
An EU probe would focus on Google's position vis-a-vis advertisers, publishers, intermediaries and rivals, one of the people said, indicating deeper scrutiny than the French antitrust agency's case concluded last week.
Google made $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world. Ads on its properties, including search, YouTube and Gmail, accounted for the bulk of sales and profits. 
About 16% of revenue came from its display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.
Both units are under fire. The U.S. Justice Department, joined by some states, sued Google last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house. 
France last week settled with Google for $268 million and various commitments over similar allegations related to the network business, and the unit also must work closely with Britain's competition regulator on upcoming software changes as part of a settlement reached days later. 
The Commission declined to comment. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google's ad empire. Market researcher eMarketer expects Google to control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display. 
While the numbers may not look monopolistic at first blush, advertisers and rivals contend that Google's various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid. 
They say Google takes advantage of the dependence buyers, sellers and intermediaries have on it to extract high fees from all sides and block rivals from fairly competing with it.
In a questionnaire sent to Google rivals and third parties earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog asked if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.
The Commission should conclude ongoing cases before starting new ones, said Thomas Hoppner, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, and who advises several complainants against Google.

""From the practitioner's point of view and from the industry's point of view, it appears equally important to bring investigations into local search and Google's job search to an end when other authorities have opened investigations into Google's adtech,"" he said.

(CLOV) went public on January 8, 2021, after merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp III (IPOC), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. However, on February 4, Hindenburg Research published a report revealing that CLOV didn’t disclose of it being under an active investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for issues including deceptive sales practices and undisclosed third-party deals, before the merger.
Such negativity surrounding CLOV and high short interest in the stock attracted the attention of the subreddit WallStreetBets. A lot of discussion on the stock on the online forum and consequent action of retail traders made the stock skyrocket lately. This meme stock hit its 52-week high of $28.85 on June 9. While the stock gained 84.2% over the past month and closed yesterday’s trading session at $12.56, Wall Street analysts expect the stock to hit $9.67 in the near term, indicating a potential downside of 23%. This reflects analysts’ concerns over its poor financials and illegal practices. Therefore, we believe the stock is best avoided now.
However, the health insurance industry has witnessed a huge number of customers taking policies upon pandemic-driven awareness. Many health insurers have upgraded their policies with various premium options, attractive reimbursement policies, adding coverage of various diseases into plans, and favorable contracts with healthcare providers to capitalize on the growing demand. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act backed by the Biden administration in ensuring lower healthcare costs and expanded insurance coverage makes the prospects bright for the industry. The global health insurance market is expected to grow at a 5.5% CAGR over the next seven years to reach $3.04 trillion by 2028.

Given this backdrop, we believe Flowserve (FLS), Enable Midstream (NYSE:ENBL), and Star Group (SGU) are ideal investment bets for the second half of the year.After hitting record lows back in April 2020, oil prices made a stellar comeback to hit new highs lately, backed by production cuts by major oil-producing countries across the globe and rising demand from the reopening economic activities. OPEC plans to ease its production cuts by 2.1 million barrels per day between May and July, with a strong forecast that the demand would rise by 5.95 million barrels per day (BPD) this year, or 6.6%.
So, oil and gas companies engaged in midstream activities should witness solid growth with upward pressure on oil prices. The renewed investor optimism is evident from the Global X MLP & Energy Infrastructure ETF’s (MLPX) 36.9% returns year-to-date compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 12.9% gains.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 02:26PM ET</span>",Investors brace for annual Russell index rebalancing with pandemic imprint,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Market participants are girding for probably the biggest trading event of the year next Friday, as FTSE Russell stages the final reconstitution of its indexes, and trillions of dollars in investments could be influenced by the event that will reflect a wild trading year marked by the pandemic and the ""meme"" stock craze.
On the last Friday every June, FTSE Russell refreshes the components in its range of indexes, such as the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks and Russell 1000 index of large-cap names. Together they make up the Russell 3000 index. There are also style indexes such as the Russell 1000 growth and Russell 2000 value.
It is often the heaviest trading volume day of the year, as investors and fund managers scramble to buy or sell shares to dozens or even hundreds of companies to reflect changes in indexes. Many this year will be watching ""meme stocks"" like GameStop (NYSE:GME) or AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) whose value soared. Companies that went public through mergers with a Specialty Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) will also be on the radar.
As of the end of 2020, about $10.6 trillion in investor assets was benchmarked to Russell's U.S. indexes, according to FTSE Russell. 
While FTSE Russell has occasionally tweaked its rules for inclusion in its indexes, such as allowing companies with multiple share classes to remain in or be permitted for inclusion, this year's reconstitution has no methodology changes. 
""Our policy team obviously regularly talks to the market participants and our committees and there were no new rules identified that were needed,"" said Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell Director of Product Management. 
Market capitalization for the Russell 3000 index vaulted from $31.4 trillion in 2020 to $47.7 trillion as of Russell's ""rank day"" on May 7, 2021. 
Stock market volatility took the index on a wild ride in the past two years. In early 2020, stocks sold off when the pandemic hit but then rebounded late in the first quarter to remain about flat from the previous year. This year the market cap for the index surged as stocks have rebounded along with vaccine distribution and a reduction in pandemic-induced lockdowns. 
Graphic: Performance of Russell indexes between rank days - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkxwndpm/Pasted%20image%201624033482199.png 
""It’s more assets, more appreciation, you’ve got some stocks that have gotten bigger weight changes so they are going to see more trading volume because there is jumping around, so this is a bigger trade this year than it has been in previous years"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York. 
The market cap breakpoint Russell uses to determine inclusion in the large-cap Russell 1000 or the small cap 2000 also increased to $5.2 billion in 2021 from $3 billion in 2020. 
Perhaps no group of stocks exemplified the pandemic trading environment more than the so-called ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment. 
Shares for those companies had languished and even been shorted by many institutional investors due to poor fundamentals. They took off like a rocket as retail investors using commission-free trading services looked for places to invest government stimulus checks. 
The market cap of AMC, for instance, stood at $4.3 billion on the May 7 rank day, but has surged to over $30 billion by June 17, well above the top end of the market cap band for the Russell 2000 index of $7.3 billion set by Russell. 
GameStop is expected to graduate to the Russell 1000 large cap index. Managers who have chosen not to own those stocks prefer they stay within the index so as not to disrupt their performance versus the benchmark. 
""Where those stocks move will dictate a lot of active manager’s relative performance over the following six, eight or 10 months after the rebalancing,"" said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
""I would rather have AMC in the benchmark because obviously since I don’t own it I think it is overvalued."" Therefore, if AMC falls, his investments would look better against the benchmark.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects 255 additions to the Russell 3000 and 295 deletions, and expects 57 stocks will enter the Russell 1000, including 34 currently in the Russell 2000. Goldman anticipated a total of 279 stock will enter the small cap index, comprised of 232 new components and 47 being knocked down from the large cap index. 
A big portion of expected adds will be companies that went public through a merger with a SPAC. Jefferies' DeSanctis estimates over 25% of additions to the Russell 3000 are SPAC companies.
""It is the year of the SPAC, the year of the meme stock - and here they are having ramifications on real money,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. 
During the event every year, volume surges near the close, often resulting in the biggest trading volume day of the year. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange have contingency plans for the event. 

KBW analyst Melissa Roberts expects the bulk of passive fund trading related to the reconstitution will occur in the last 15 minutes or so of the session and estimates the net trade will total nearly $75 billion.
""Let’s face it, for the New York Stock Exchange - Russell reconstitution, from a trading standpoint, is the greatest show on earth, that’s where it all comes down,"" said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","Trump, House Democrats working to resolve dispute on Deutsche Bank subpoenas","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives remain in talks to resolve disputes concerning congressional subpoenas of the former U.S. president's financial records from  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB), their lawyers said on Friday.
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), long Trump's main bank, has taken no position on the subpoenas and said it would comply with the law.
A joint status report filed in Manhattan federal court did not say whether Trump and the Democrats, who control the House, still believed they were ""close to an agreement,"" as they had been when filing a similar report on May 17.
The lawyers said all parties, including Deutsche Bank, are addressing matters concerning ""the scope, logistics, and other factors implicated by the proposed terms of any such resolution to determine the best procedure to move this case forward."" They asked a judge for another 30 days to continue talks.
Lawyers for Trump and the Democrats did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Two House committees had in 2019 subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for years of banking records concerning Trump, his adult children and his businesses.
The House Financial Services Committee was examining possible money laundering in U.S. property transactions, while the House Intelligence Committee was probing whether Trump's dealmaking left him vulnerable to foreign government influence.
Trump opposed the subpoenas, citing the powers he then had as president. Unlike several recent presidents, he declined to make his tax records public.
Last July, the U.S. Supreme Court said Trump did not have an absolute right to block Congress from seeing his records, but said a lower court failed to adequately consider whether lawmakers' demands were overbroad or too intrusive.

The 2019 subpoenas have expired but an agreement on Deutsche Bank's records would eliminate a need for new subpoenas.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has eight years of Trump's tax returns for a criminal probe into the former president and his businesses, after the Supreme Court separately rejected Trump's effort to keep Vance from seeing them.

So, both Airbnb (ABNB) and Choice Hotels International (NYSE:CHH) might witness a solid recovery this year. But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) and Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH) are two of the emerging players in the hospitality industry offering accommodation-related services. ABNB’s marketplace model connects hosts and guests online or through mobile devices, offering the facilities to book accommodations, including private rooms and luxury villas. CHH operates as a hotel franchisor worldwide operating under brands such as Comfort Suites, Clarion, WoodSpring Suites, and Cambria Hotels.
The hotel industry was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic last year witnessing low occupancy and hotel closures. Even though the industry is far from returning to the pre-pandemic levels, it has been gradually recovering as the vaccine rollout continues and restrictions continue to be lifted. Several new methods such as contactless check-ins are further expected to help the industry revive in the post-pandemic scenario. According to a Lodging Analytics Research & Consulting (LARC) report, the United States’ RevPar is expected to increase by 30.6% in 2021.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union on Friday lost its bid to speed up deliveries of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccines, the first of its legal challenges against the drugmaker that rocked the bloc as it scrambled to shore up supplies.
AstraZeneca said the EU had lost its legal case, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the court ruling supported its view that the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant had failed to honour its commitments.
The row plunged the EU into crisis earlier this year as states, under pressure to speed up vaccinations, scrambled for shots. Brussels has since largely cut ties with AstraZeneca, choosing not to buy any more of its vaccines for now. 
The drugmaker had committed to do its best to deliver 300 million doses to the 27-nation bloc by the end of June, but production delays led it to revise this to 100 million vaccines.
This delayed the EU's vaccination drive as the bloc had initially bet on AstraZeneca to deliver the largest volume, sparking a bitter row and EU legal action to get at least 120 million doses by the end of June.
However, the judge ruled that AstraZeneca must deliver only 80.2 million doses by a deadline of Sept. 27. The drugmaker said it would ""substantially exceed"" that by the end of June.
The court said in a statement that AstraZeneca must deliver 15 million doses by July 26, another 20 million by Aug. 23 and a further 15 million by Sept. 27, to reach a total of 50 million doses, which are in addition to 30 million that had been given to the EU when the legal case began.
Should it miss the deadlines in the ruling, AstraZeneca would face a penalty of ""10 euros ($11.8) per dose not delivered"", the judge said, less than the 10 euros per dose per day fine the EU had sought in bringing its legal action.
AstraZeneca will remain bound to do its best to deliver 300 million doses to the EU, and a new hearing is to be held in September when compliance with the contract will be assessed again, the ruling said.
The EU had asked all 300 million doses to be delivered by the end of September, but the court did not set a deadline. 
EU data shows the company has already shipped nearly 70 million doses, more than half of which were delivered after the start of the legal proceedings. 
This brings AstraZeneca close to already meeting the court's requirement of 80 million doses in total by Sept. 27. 
SERIOUS BREACH
An EU lawyer also said the judgment meant that as a proof of best effort, AstraZeneca will have to deliver COVID-19 vaccines from a factory in Britain, if needed to meet its EU commitments.
The company had said it could not immediately deliver to the EU doses from an Oxford BioMedica factory because it had to supply Britain first.
The ruling said that AstraZeneca may have committed a serious breach of the contract by reserving Oxford BioMedica's output for the British market. However a final decision on this will be made in a second legal case. 
AstraZeneca said the court had found that the EU had no exclusivity or right of priority over other parties.
""The judgment also acknowledged that the difficulties experienced by AstraZeneca in this unprecedented situation had a substantial impact on the delay,"" it said in a statement. 

""AstraZeneca now looks forward to renewed collaboration with the European Commission to help combat the pandemic in Europe.""
The EU last month launched a second legal action against AstraZeneca over an alleged breach of the supply contract, which will continue after the summer. Friday's ruling was over whether AstraZeneca must speed up vaccine deliveries.

Investing.com – Shares of integrated oil companies as well as standalone refiners and marketers fell Friday as the dollar strengthened and so did crude prices even though other commodities fell.
The dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, is on course for the largest weekly gain since September.
A rising dollar makes oil more expensive in other currencies, curbing demand.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), BP (NYSE:BP) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) fell 2% each and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) was 1.5% lower. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) lost 4% in the session underway.
U.S. Federal Reserves’ hawkish tone on Wednesday on inflation has spooked investors even as the central bank ruled out a rate hike until at least 2023. Conflicting data points and breakdown of traditional thumb rules are also causing investor anxiety.
At 1255 ET, U.S. crude Crude Oil WTI Futures was up 0.9% at $71.67 a barrel, while Brent Brent Oil Futures was up 0.5% at $73.47. On Wednesday, Brent settled at its highest price since April 2019, while WTI settled at its highest since October 2018.  
Earlier Friday, OPEC officials received information that indicated U.S. oil output growth will likely remain limited in 2021 despite rising prices, Reuters reported.
Higher oil prices, while being an incentive for all explorers, are of particular significance to U.S. shale gas producers given their cost of production for every barrel is higher and elevated prices make it more attractive for them to extract.   
U.S. producers are instead choosing to focus on capital discipline and investor returns, rather than expanding supply, the OPEC's Economic Commission Board heard, according to a Reuters report.

(Reuters) - A near-record dollar amount of single stock equity options -totaling $818 billion - is set to expire at the close of trading on Friday afternoon, potentially driving sharp moves in some stocks throughout the day, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote.
A recent surge in interest in options trading, fueled in part by droves of retail traders looking to place wagers on the swings in so-called meme stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, has boosted trading in U.S. single stock options to record highs this year.
Single stock open interest now stands at nearly $3 trillion in notional terms, close to the highest level since Jan. 15, according to the report, which was authored by analysts Vishal Vivek and John Marshall and published on Friday morning. 
The sheer volume of trading in some of these options is enough to move the stocks, analysts say.
""We know that the activity in the equity options from a lot of the younger meme traders and speculative trade is very high,"" Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas, said.
Price action in GameStop and AMC was comparatively muted, with the companies' shares down 3.52% and up 0.74%, respectively, on Friday afternoon. The S&P 500 was off 0.90%.
Friday also marks ""quadruple witching day,"" the quarterly simultaneous expiration of U.S. options and futures contracts, a market event that has in the past spurred record trading volumes as investors and dealers buy and sell derivative contracts and shares to replace expiring positions.

Stocks where a large percentage of contracts, relative to their average daily volume, are set to expire on Friday are worth watching, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
 Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc,  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) , were some names to focus on, the report said.

Investing.com --  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was named a top pick among large cap social media stocks by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Shares nonetheless dropped more than 1%. 
The company's  investments and monetization efforts offset any near-term engagement drop-offs as the pandemic nears an end, the firm said, according to CNBC.
“We remain most positive on FB within the large cap social media names as we see their leading ROI, product innovation, and monetization call options (Reels, Marketplace, Shopping, etc) enabling them to navigate through difficult near-term engagement headwinds,” the firm said.
Morgan Stanley also sees Facebook driving ad growth, helping the social media giant navigate through near-term engagement headwinds.
“We also note that even a slight increase in News Feed ad load could offset any engagement decline. In our view, the extent to which FB can deliver on topline can lead to $16+ of free cash flow per share next year, painting a path toward our $440 bull case (~30% upside),” the analysts said.
Less time on social media as a result of Covid-19 restrictions being lifted means innovation and ad pricing become more important, Morgan Stanley said. That will help drive ad growth and allow the company to beat estimates in the second half of this year and next.
“It will be increasingly important for social platforms to continue to develop products (social shopping, short-form video, maps, etc) that drive engagement and deliver measurable ad ROI directly linking ad dollars to transactions,” the analysts said.

However, I believe investors are underestimating the challenge that rising costs will create for companies like Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Cruises (CCL), and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H).Most analysts expect the second half of the year to be quite strong as the economy gradually returns to normal. The biggest beneficiary will be the travel and tourism sector which has been offline for much of the past 15 months. Companies in these sectors will certainly benefit from pent-up demand over the next few quarters which should lead to higher revenues and more pricing power.
However, these companies do face a notable challenge. In order to meet this demand, they will need to aggressively hire workers which is proving to be difficult for many businesses especially without meaningfully raising wages. Many workers left the industry to pursue work in other sectors which were hiring over the last year. Many older workers seem to have permanently left the workforce. 
Most likely, these companies will have to significantly raise wages and offer additional benefits to attract workers. This will inevitably eat into margins. I don’t expect this to matter in the near term given the surge in demand, but I do think on a longer-term basis, it will lead to lower multiples. Of course, the same circumstances are playing out with other costs such as food and energy. Therefore, investors should be wary of the following stocks: Shake Shack (SHAK), Carnival Cruises (CCL), and Hyatt Hotels (H).

The Berlin-based biotech startup, which is exploring the use of psychedelic treatments for mental illnesses, raised $225 million from selling 15 million shares in its upsized initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday.
The company's shares opened at $21, higher than the IPO price of $15, but gave up early gains to trade flat by 1600 GMT. 
Atai was co-founded in 2018 by German investor Christian Angermayer, an advocate of the benefits of using psychedelics such as psilocybin to treat depression, anxiety and substance use disorders. The German startup has backed several companies developing such therapies.
Psilocybin, the psychedelic active compound in magic mushrooms, was found to be at least as effective as escitalopram, a leading antidepressant drug, in a study by British scientists.
Atai was considering floating its shares in the United States in May, Reuters reported in March, citing a source close to the matter.
Its debut comes at a time when U.S. IPOs have already raised $171 billion in the first six months of the year, scorching past the 2020 record of $168 billion, according to data from Dealogic.
Angermayer has backed about 30 biotech companies, including immunotherapies firm Sensei Biotherapeutics, mental healthcare company Compass Pathways and artificial intelligence-powered drug discovery platform AbCellera Biologics, all of which listed in the United States in recent months.

Germany-based laser communication technologies firm Mynaric and data center operator Northern Data, both partially owned by Angermayer, are also planning to list on the Nasdaq later in 2021 or in 2022, Reuters reported on Thursday.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Cowen and Berenberg were the lead underwriters for the offering.

His comments came after the Fed signalled a hawkish tilt earlier this week, which had rattled risk-driven markets.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>","Facebook's 'Neighborhoods' faces crowded niche market, profiling concerns","By Elizabeth Culliford and Moira Warburton
(Reuters) - When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) began testing its new ""Neighborhoods"" feature in Canada last October amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the tech giant described it as a dedicated place for people to connect with their local communities. 
Here, in a corner of the world's largest social network, people met neighbors, shared banana bread ingredients, helped locate missing cats and swapped local business recommendations, the feature's product manager Reid Patton said in a recent interview.
But Facebook, which is rolling out the feature in four U.S. cities - Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; Newark, New Jersey; and San Diego, California - is already playing catch-up in the red-hot market for local social apps. Community site Nextdoor has emerged as a key player along with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Ring's Neighbors and crime-tracking app Citizen. Nextdoor, which saw usage surge during lockdowns, reported 50% annual growth in daily active users last year.
Facebook has in recent years focused on on-site communities that matter to its users as a tactic to drive engagement. The company, which made the vast majority of its almost $84.2 billion ad revenue last year from smaller businesses, many of whom court local users, also said users' activity and information in Neighborhoods may be used to personalize their experience and ads across Facebook.
Neighborhoods users are prompted to introduce themselves, log interests and answer ice-breaker questions, like favorite DIY projects. People can take roles like ""socializer"" or ""helper"" and their profile information populates a directory that even identifies local pets by name, Patton said.
But Facebook, long under fire for its moderation and design decisions, will likely contend with challenges that have bedeviled rival hyperlocal platforms, such as misinformation, racial profiling and privacy concerns, say civil rights groups and social media researchers.
Facebook is already under scrutiny from lawmakers over its Groups feature, which it says is used by more than 1.8 billion people every month, including to connect with their local communities. Researchers identified Facebook Groups as a source of false claims and violent incitement ahead of the U.S. Capitol riot.
""Online rhetoric can lead into offline antagonism and violence really quickly,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center who has researched how Facebook Groups have been used to push conspiracies. ""Facebook's moderation of Groups leaves a lot to be desired.""
Facebook's Patton said the team designing Neighborhoods took into account problems in Groups: ""We've tried to learn from across Facebook products and beyond, and build an experience that does make people feel safe.""
A Neighborhood largely relies on multiple unpaid community moderators, offered the role by Facebook after it assesses how active they are in other communities and screens rule-breakers. It is also developing moderator training on sensitive issues. All Neighborhoods users must be over 18 and new accounts or repeat rule-violators are not allowed.
As designed, recent traffic on some Neighborhoods showed typical local community messages. In San Diego, residents shared dog photos and alerts for lost house keys. In Toronto, posts ranged from a poll about dating in the pandemic to pictures of a stolen bike.
Facebook has not marketed public safety as a focus of Neighborhoods, but Reuters found the citizen crime warnings endemic in community apps are already showing up. In Vancouver, users commented on a photo of a man said to have been following women in the area, while someone else described an encounter with someone breaking into their house. Stills were shared from security cameras of a ""suspicious person"" looking at a property and kids who allegedly stole packages. On the last post, a user advised saving a box and putting dog feces in it. 
Patton said Neighborhoods has no features involving law enforcement. Nextdoor has yanked a tool for users to forward their posts to police and Amazon Ring's Neighbors is now making police requests more transparent.
Though Neighborhoods' community guidelines instruct users to be inclusive and kind, surveillance researchers argue fast-growing local platforms do not focus enough on potential harms, like racial profiling and misinformation. Citizen made headlines last month when it put out a $30,000 bounty to find a homeless man it wrongly accused of starting a wildfire. 
""I would not be surprised if (Facebook) cared a little bit less about the kindness you show to the people you suspect are stealing your packages,"" said Matthew Guariglia, a surveillance analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Facebook's biggest challenge in the hyperlocal market is overcoming the head start of its competitors. Nextdoor said it covers a third of U.S. households, operates in 276,000 neighborhoods globally and is planning expansion in more countries. 
Facebook's arrival ""doesn't really mean anything. It means eyes on the prize,"" Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar said in an interview. ""From a broader perspective it certainly, I think, proves our point that local has never mattered more.""

Investing.com – AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shares fell more than 1% Friday after a Brussels judge’s ordered it to deliver millions of doses of its Covid-19 shots to the European Union, with a penalty if it is unable to do so.
According to an AP report, the European Commission said that the judge had ordered the company to respect a delivery schedule of 15 million doses by July 26, 20 million doses by August 23 and 15 million doses by September 27.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told AP the decision confirms the company had failed to honor its commitments.
The judge also ordered a fine of 10 euros ($12) for every dose not delivered.
The company also claimed victory. “All other measures sought by the European Commission have been dismissed, and in particular the Court found that the European Commission has no exclusivity or right of priority over all other contracting parties,” AstraZeneca said in a note.
The vaccine-maker said the company has supplied more than 70 million doses to the EU and will substantially exceed 80.2 million by the end of this month.
AstraZeneca was seen as the backbone of the EU’s vaccine rollout. Its contract with the European Commission foresaw 300 million doses being distributed initially, with an option for another 100 million, but the speed of deliveries was far slower than the company originally thought.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 11:53AM ET</span>",Two Apple Daily executives charged with collusion with foreign country,"By Jessie Pang and Sara Cheng
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong police charged the chief editor and chief executive of pro-democracy tabloid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily on Friday with collusion with a foreign country, a national security case that has sent chills through the city's media. 
Some 500 police raided the media outlet on Thursday and five Apple Daily executives were arrested on suspicion that dozens of its articles violated Hong Kong's new security law.
Police said they charged two of the five on Friday, identified by Apple Daily as editor-in-chief Ryan Law and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung. 
The other three, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Puiman and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai, were released on bail late on Friday, according to Apple Daily.
The exact terms of their bail were not immediately known, but it appeared the three had not been charged.
""I know that there are still two other colleagues who cannot come out yet. They are being charged under the national security law. I am very upset. I hope they can be bailed out soon,"" Chan said as she left the police station. 
""I know the company and Apple Daily colleagues continue to uphold their duty professionally, continue to report the news. I am proud of them. I am very touched. We will try our best.""
Earlier, police also said they would prosecute three companies related to Apple Daily for the same offence after freezing HK$18 million ($2.32 million) of their assets.
The arrests have raised further alarm over media freedom in Hong Kong and have been criticised by Western governments and international rights groups and press associations.
The chief U.N. human rights spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said on Friday the raid ""sends a further chilling message for media freedom"".
The national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 on the former British colony has brought an authoritarian tone to most aspects of life in Hong Kong, including education and arts.
It was the first case in which authorities have cited media articles as potentially violating the security law, which was imposed after almost a year of mass pro-democracy protests. Beijing says the law was necessary to bring stability to the city after the sometimes violent unrest. 
Democracy supporters flocked to buy copies of Apple Daily on Friday to protest against the raid.
The popular 26-year-old paper, which combines liberal discourse with celebrity gossip and investigations of those in power, increased its Friday press run to 500,000 copies, up from 80,000 the previous day.
'HANG IN THERE'
In the Mong Kok district, queues formed at some kiosks at midnight, with some customers carting off hundreds of first editions on trolleys and suitcases.
""You never know when this newspaper will die,"" said one reader who only gave his last name, Tsang, because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""As Hong Kongers, we need to preserve the history. Hang in there as long as we can. Although the road is rough, we still need to walk it, as there's no other road.""
By the morning, some newsstands in central Hong Kong had already sold out. 
Tam, a 40-year-old banker, said he had bought his first newspaper in 20 years after hearing about the raid.
""I don't mean to do anything with the newspaper in my hand. It's just for my conscience,"" he said.
It was the second time police had raided the newsroom after the arrest last August of media tycoon Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy activist and staunch Beijing critic, who owns Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily. 
Lai's assets have since been frozen as he faces three charges under the security law. He is serving prison sentences for taking part in illegal assemblies.

Hong Kong officials have repeatedly said that media freedom and other rights will remain intact, but that national security is a red line.
China's Foreign Commissioner's Office said in a statement the national security law protected press freedom, while warning ""external forces"" to ""keep their hands off Hong Kong"".

Data from Refinitiv Lipper showed investors bought $386 million worth of U.S. equity funds in the week to June 16, with caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting outcome, capping further inflows. 
U.S. equity value funds attracted $1.7 billion worth of inflows, while growth funds received a net $1.85 billion, after facing outflows for the past two weeks.

Among equity sectors, U.S. real estate funds attracted purchases worth a net $528 million, in their third consecutive week of net inflows, bolstered by a surge in housing prices in the United States. 
Wall Street's main indexes were jolted earlier this week after the Fed unexpectedly signaled it could begin tapering its massive stimulus sooner than expected, setting the benchmark S&P 500 on course to snap a three-week winning streak.
The U.S. money market funds had $26.4 billion in outflows, the biggest in nine weeks.

Also, investors purchased a net $4.3 billion in U.S. bond funds, the lowest in three weeks. Both U.S. taxable bond funds and municipal bond funds witnessed the lowest net buying in three weeks at $2.7 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively. U.S. short and intermediate investment-grade funds attracted $2.63 billion in inflows, a 12% increase over the last week. Inflation-protected bond funds, with inflows of $0.8 billion, also lured investors for the seventh straight week.

Shares were little changed.
The firm placed a price target of $254 on the stock, a Street-high according to data complied by Investing.com. 
""Churchill Downs owns one of the most iconic assets in the United States, Churchill Downs Racetrack, home to the Kentucky Derby, the longest running sporting event in the country.

Churchill Downs is a racing, online wagering and gaming entertainment company, and owns and operates three pari-mutuel gaming entertainment venues in Kentucky, as well as TwinSpires, one of the largest online horse race wagering, online sportsbook and iGaming platforms in the U.S. The company also has about 11,000 slot machines and video lottery terminals and 200 table games in eight states.
Sales have recovered steadily throughout the pandemic after an initial hit.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Traders beef up U.S. renewable fuel teams as demand soars,"By Laura Sanicola and Devika Krishna Kumar
(Reuters) - Commodity merchants and investment firms such as Citadel, Gunvor and Trafigura are bolstering U.S. teams that specialize in trading renewable fuels as demand soars, according to people familiar with the matter.
Many trading firms already have an established presence in Europe, but the production of advanced biofuels that act as petroleum fuel substitutes has driven hiring in the United States in recent months, the sources said. Renewable fuels account for roughly 12% of U.S. energy consumption, according to government data, and are growing every year.
In April, hedge fund Citadel made its first entry in the U.S. renewable fuels trading space, a source close to the firm said. The firm brought in Jay McCall as head of North America Environmental Products Trading based in San Francisco, according to source familiar with the matter and his LinkedIn page. McCall previously was director of environmental commodities trading at DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) Trading.
In the same month, commodities trader Gunvor hired Shane Foster to its renewable energy division based in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Gunvor is already active in some U.S. renewables markets such as biodiesel and feedstocks and the company is actively seeking to expand across the renewables supply chain, three of the sources said. 
Rival trader Trafigura is looking to hire traders specializing in renewable natural gas, renewable diesel and feedstocks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Last year, Trafigura hired Scott Adair in Calgary, Alberta, to trade power, renewable energy and environmental commodities. 
Trafigura, Citadel and Gunvor declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Production of renewable fuels is rising as refiners look for ways to offset carbon emissions, and to take advantage of state and federal incentives such as California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard which makes such fuel production lucrative.
U.S. refiner  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO)'s renewable diesel segment reported a record operating income of $203 million in the first quarter of 2021, while its petroleum refining unit posted a loss.
Several U.S. petroleum refiners and other companies announced plans to produce more fuels from animal fats and soybean oils at their facilities, but the majority of those projects remain to be built.
Trading shops are also boosting efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.

DK Gunvor said in March that it aims to cut its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 40% in absolute terms by 2025. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, while Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Gunvor has also set up a new subsidiary to invest in non-hydrocarbon projects. 
Gunvor's new unit will invest in biofuel, renewable power projects such as solar and biomass, and the commercialization of alternative fuels like hydrogen and ammonia.

However, interest rates moved lower, and the yield curve flattened. Both are positive developments for gold. Taylor Dart identified 3 gold miners worth buying on the dip: Pretium Resources (NYSE:PVG), Newmont Corporation (NEM), and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM).After a brief period of outperformance vs. the major market averages, the precious metals complex has been hit hard again this week, with gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) down more than 5% for the week. This violent pullback is one of the worst we’ve seen in years, given its velocity. Fortunately, it’s provided a second opportunity to start positions in miners at very reasonable valuations. While the gold price falling $125/oz certainly doesn’t help margins for miners, it’s important to note that most miners are producing gold for less than $1,025/oz, still enjoying 40% plus margins at current gold prices. Let’s take a look at a few names that look compelling if this weakness continues:
The Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)) is one way that investors can play the precious metals sector to gain leverage on gold. However, I prefer individual names since the index often has many laggards that can impede its overall performance, and it doesn’t pay a material dividend. Three names that look like standouts among their peers are Pretium Resources (PVG), Newmont Corporation (NEM), and Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM), with the latter two being clear leaders in their sub-sectors. All three of these miners differ in size and risk, but all three look like solid bets as sellers rush for the exits following the recent beatdown in the gold price. Let’s begin with WPM:
Wheaton Precious Metals is one of the largest royalty & streaming companies globally and is one of the lowest-risk ways to play the sector, given that the company has extremely high margins above 70%. Its business model of financing miners to build or expand their projects and then take a cut of their production is superior to most gold miners. This is because the company has diversified revenue across dozens of assets and significant upside as new royalties come online, or mines are extended past their initial expectations. The company just came off a strong quarter in Q1 from a financial standpoint with a record revenue of $324.1MM, with the company benefiting from a 13% increase in its gold sales price and a 53% increase in its silver sales price. This has set the company up for a year of significant annual earnings per share [EPS], especially as its mines ramp back up after what was a disrupted 2020 due to some temporary COVID-19 related shutdowns.

Ahead of the meeting, investor advisory groups Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended shareholders vote against her re-election because of concerns over how Boohoo dealt with worker conditions in its supply chain and over executive pay.
Boohoo, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products targeted at 16- to 40-year-olds, said 11.96% of votes cast at its annual general meeting (AGM) were against the resolution to re-elect Kane, while 88.04% were in favour.
""The board is delighted that shareholders have recognised the important and very specific role Carol has on the board with a very strong vote in her favour,"" Boohoo said.
Boohoo's other co-founder Mahmud Kamani did not face a vote on his re-election this year.
In September, Boohoo accepted all the recommendations of an independent review that found major failings in its supply chain in England after newspaper allegations about working conditions and low pay in factories in the Leicester area.
The group pledged to fix the problems with its 'Agenda for Change' programme.
On Tuesday, Boohoo said the programme had made ""excellent progress"". It said it was on track to publish a global supplier list in September and continued to review its manufacturing supplier base.
Boohoo has also faced investor criticism over a bonus scheme which would pay up to 150 million pounds ($207.4 million) to its founders and executives if its share price rises 66% over three years from June 2020.
A separate bonus scheme for CEO John Lyttle could net him 50 million pounds if Boohoo's market value reaches 6 billion pounds by 2024.
At the AGM 20.2% of votes cast opposed Boohoo's pay report, an improvement on last year's 34.08% vote against.

""The remuneration committee looks forward to ongoing engagement with the group’s shareholders as it continues to shape the group’s future remuneration policy,"" Boohoo said.

The deal announced on Friday sees HSBC take another significant step in a wider retreat from slow-growing European and North American markets where it has struggled against larger domestic players.
Meanwhile Cerberus continues to snap up banks in Europe, where the U.S. based private equity fund already owns stakes in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The deal will see My Money acquire HSBC's 244 branches, around 3900 staff and 24 billion euros in assets, creating at a stroke what My Money described as a new challenger bank in France's crowded retail banking landscape.
""Our aim would be for the bank to return to profitability, three years after we have taken control of it,"" My Money Chief Executive Eric Shehadeh said in a statement.
HSBC shares were down 1.9% at 1339 GMT, after slipping ahead of the announcement of a deal that had been widely reported.
The sale price would be a nominal 1 euro, HSBC said, adding that the business would have a net asset value of $2 billion at the time the deal completes, with the British bank agreeing to make up any shortfall in that valuation if it declines.
CCF COMEBACK
My Money said it will resurrect the Credit Commercial de France (CCF) brand, which HSBC bought for some 11 billion euros 21 years ago as it attempted to gain a foothold in one of Europe's biggest markets. It also plans to invest 200 million euros in the HSBC unit's technology infrastructure. 
Under French law, the two parties have to consult employees on the deal, and if HSBC and My Money decide to proceed it could be signed in the third or fourth quarter of this year, with completion due in 2023.
Shehadeh said My Money was a ""responsible employer"" and that any job cuts would not happen until 2024 or 2025. 
HSBC will retain other parts of its French business including its investment and business banking units.
The deal marks HSBC's second exit from a major Western market this year after it sold its U.S. retail banking businesses, as Chief Executive Noel Quinn cuts his losses in markets where HSBC has long struggled to be profitable.
Low central bank interest rates and competition from domestic players have combined to make traditional deposit-taking retail businesses unattractive in many developed markets in recent years, especially where banks are subscale. 
HSBC put its French retail business under “strategic review” in September 2019, with a sale launched in December the same year, as it abandoned a long struggle to generate sufficient profits from the unit.
The business made a loss before tax of $288 million euros for the financial year ended 31 Dec 2020, HSBC said. 
HSBC struggled to attract interest as bidders fretted at the heavy restructuring assumed to be necessary, and complex talks with local regulators. French banks, which initially studied the dossier, all walked away.

Dutch bank ING said separately it had also placed its French retail banking business under strategic review.

The EU did not name the banks reinstated but a Commision source said Nomura, UniCredit, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) can take part in the next syndicated debt sale. The source said the reinstated banks were included in a request for proposals issued on Friday, a precursor to the next bond syndication for the recovery fund. 
The EU executive is still assessing the other two banks banned from the bond sale. Those banks, Natixis and NatWest declined to comment. 
The European Union on Tuesday raised 20 billion euros with the first sale of bonds backing its recovery fund which is set to turn it into a leading European debt issuer. 
But 10 of the bloc's biggest primary dealers were banned from working on the deal. 
The exclusion related to past breaches of antitrust rules, with the EU saying it wanted to see evidence they had taken remedial action before allowing them to take part.
""The eight banks have provided information that allow the Commission to conclude that their further exclusion from participation in syndicated transactions in EU bond issuance is not warranted,"" the Commission said in an email.
Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this week that the European Commission could soon give a green light for those banned banks to return after taking steps to alleviate EU concerns. 

The EU Commission has completed a quarter of about 80 billion euros of long-term bond issuance planned in 2021 to back the fund fundraising with Tuesday’s syndication, and two more syndications are expected by the end of July.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 09:21AM ET</span>","Ahead of pivotal AGM, Toshiba board chairman vows to be 'agent of positive change'","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama pledged to be ""an agent of positive change, not a protector of the status quo,"" as he sought support from shareholders ahead of a crucial vote on director nominees next week that is seen as difficult to call.
Nagayama has come under intense pressure to resign after an explosive independent investigation this month found that Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) colluded with the Japanese government to block foreign shareholders from having influence on the board.
""As the chairperson my priority is to provide Toshiba with the governance and leadership that you deserve,"" he said in an open letter to shareholders on Friday.
Shareholder advisory groups Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis have both recommended against his reappointment as has Toshiba's No. 2 shareholder, Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners. 
While Nagayama joined Toshiba in mid-2020 after the alleged pressuring of foreign shareholders took place, they argue that he should take responsibility for the board initially having resisted a shareholder's call for an independent probe.
At an extraordinary general meeting in March, Toshiba shareholders successfully voted for the probe into the allegations that the company sought to unduly influence some investors ahead of last year's annual general meeting. Gaining 58% of the votes, it was a landmark win for corporate governance in Japan.
But it is by no means clear that Toshiba's large activist shareholder base will win the day again next week. 
Toshiba's shareholder base has changed somewhat since the conglomerate was reinstated in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's TOPIX index in late February, bringing in index-linked funds. While many of those passive funds were not eligible to vote at the time of the March EGM, they now are.
That has made it difficult to assess whether activist or traditional shareholders will have the upper hand at the June 25 AGM.
In the letter, Nagayama reiterated plans to begin a thorough search for additional independent directors and accelerate the selection process for a new CEO.
Current CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa retook the helm in April after the company's previous leader left amid controversy over a $20 billion buyout bid from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners but has said he does not plan to stay on for too long.
Nagayama in Friday's letter also repeated promises to launch a strategic review committee immediately after the AGM and begin a new inquiry into the allegations.
He also said the board has hired Makinson Cowell, an independent global investor study firm owned by Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), to expand the scope of its survey of shareholder opinions while the company makes important strategic decisions.
Prior to joining Toshiba, Nagayama had a well-respected career as CEO of Chugai Pharmaceutical from 1992 to 2018. Chugai became part of the Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) group in 2002.

He was also a member of the board at  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp for nine years until 2019, coinciding with the electronic giant's emergence from a turbulent earnings period to a sharp recovery.
A Sony spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters: ""Nagayama, especially when he served as board chairman for six years since 2013, contributed to building up a governance system that improved corporate value through healthy checks and balances.""

Investing.com – Shares of Orphazyme (NASDAQ:ORPH) looked set for an even bigger fall Friday after an over 10% decline in the previous session as the Food and Drug Administration rejected the company’s experimental treatment, arimoclomol, for a neurodegenerative rare disease known as Niemann-Pick disease type C.
The shares were down more than 52% in premarket trading as the company seeks to reduce costs substantially and “freeze all company efforts not related to clinical and regulatory activities to support approval for NPC.”
With the Danish company’s initial outlook dependent on the regulatory decision, it has now been forced to lower that.
Orphazyme now expects operating loss of DKK 670 million to DKK 700 million (approximately $107 million to $112 million) for the full year.
It previously estimated the operating loss to come in the range of DKK 100 million to DKK150 million (approximately $16 million to $24 million).
Niemann-Pick disease type C mostly appears in childhood. The incidence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 100,000 live births and it is estimated that there are ~1,800 patients across U.S. and Europe, according to Orphazyme’s 2020 annual report.
In more aggressive forms, NPC is frequently fatal by the time patients reach their 20s.

Sternlicht’s Jaws Juggernaut Acquisition Corp. raised $240 million in its U.S. initial public offering after boosting the size of the deal by 20%, according to a statement late Thursday. The SPAC is the fifth in a series raised by Sternlicht since the beginning of last year -- all with “Jaws” in the name -- and he’s achieved the rare feat of upsizing every one of them.
It’s a sign that after a blowout 18 months for blank-check listings, in which record amounts of capital have been raised for deals across all major sectors, investors are starting to become more selective about where they place their bets and are focusing on serial dealmakers with proven track records.
Only 11% of the SPACs priced in the U.S. this quarter were upsized, down from nearly half of all offerings in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strong demand for the latest SPAC from Sternlicht, the founder of Starwood Capital, comes as the overall market slows after the glut of deals and recent regulatory crackdowns.
The listing also marks a return to the limelight for former Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. boss Paul Jacobs, who left the smartphone chipmaker in 2018. Jacobs serves as chief executive officer of the SPAC, which will hunt for acquisitions in the wireless communications industry.
Jaws Juggernaut says it’s already identified one potential target -- unusual for SPACs that usually start their search after listing. It may consider buying XCOM Labs Inc., the startup that Jacobs founded after leaving Qualcomm, and combining it with another company, according to the prospectus. That would technically comply with SPAC norms as the vehicle wouldn’t buy only XCOM.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG arranged the Jaws Juggernaut offering. Units of the SPAC start trading Friday on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the “JUGGU” ticker.
Some of Sternlicht’s previous blank-check companies have already sealed acquisitions. Jaws Spitfire Acquisition Corp., which has tennis legend Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) on its board, agreed in March to buy metal printing specialist Velo3D Inc. In June, medical provider Cano Health Inc. started trading on the New York Stock Exchange after completing a merger with Jaws Acquisition Corp.

CHENNAI (Reuters) -Shares of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani recorded their biggest weekly losses ever. The six stocks cumulatively lost 1.91 trillion Indian rupees ($25.83 billion) of value over five days through Friday. 
THE FUNDS 
Indian newspaper Economic Times reported on Monday the accounts of three Mauritius-based funds, which are among the top foreign investors in Adani group companies, had been frozen by the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL). 
The NSDL website showed accounts held by the three funds frozen as of May 31, among thousands of others, without citing a reason, according to a review by Reuters. The exact date of the freeze is unknown and the accounts remained frozen on Friday, according to the website.
DENIALS, CONTRADICTIONS
The Adani Group firms, in identical statements issued to stock exchanges, rejected media reports, including in the Economic Times, as ""blatantly erroneous.""
The companies, which are in the businesses of operating airports and ports, power generation and transmission, coal and gas trading, said the accounts in which the funds hold Adani shares were not frozen.
NSDL and India's securities regulator SEBI did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 
But a senior NSDL official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters on Monday the funds have multiple accounts and that the Adani shares were held in other accounts that were not frozen, adding that freeze was ""not new"".
The shares of the Adani companies however have continued to fall.
THE FUNDS
The three foreign funds - Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund - are all registered at the same address, according to the Mauritius financial regulator.
The funds cumulatively control 2.7% of all shares in the Adani Group companies as on June 11, calculations based on an e-mail sent by Adani executive to NSDL and reviewed by Reuters showed. 
Two other Mauritius-based funds that are also investors in Adani companies - LTS Investment Fund and Asia Investment Corp - are also registered at the same address.
Reuters was unable to find a website for all five funds, and calls to the phone numbers provided to Mauritius regulators went unanswered. 
The five funds deployed 94.4%-97.9% of their total capital in Adani companies' shares, data by Indian stocks analysis firm Trendlyne showed.
Reuters could not independently verify Trendlyne data.
Four of the six Adani stocks have a public shareholding of about 25% - the minimum level mandated by regulators for companies listed on Indian exchanges.
Indian stock exchange data shows most shares of Adani Group companies are held by trusts controlled by Adani. Foreign portfolio investors are the next largest shareholders, while retail and domestic investors typically control about 5%.
THE IMPACT
After falling 0.4-8.5% on Monday, the day of the Economic Times report, Adani group stocks fell between 7.1%-22.6% over the week compared with last Friday's close, wiping out nearly 22% of the gains in the year preceding this week. 
The decline saw the firms' cumulative market capitalisation decline by over a sixth.
Flagship Adani Enterprises rose 8.76% and Adani Ports rose 7.33% on Friday, but the four other Adani stocks each closed 5% lower.
Jimeet Modi, founder of Mumbai-based Samco Securities, said the jump in the two stocks was due to some investors buying the shares after the steep fall in prices this week, but added that the stocks were ""still in a bear market"".

""I don't think the market is convinced with the quality of the clarification from the Adani group,"" Modi told Reuters.

BOSTON (Reuters) - At Home Group (NYSE:HOME) Inc's largest investor, CAS Investment Partners LLC, is urging shareholders to join it in rejecting the home furnishing retailer's proposed sale, arguing that even after this week's price increase the offer remains far too low.
CAS, which owns 17% of At Home's shares, said private equity firm Hellman & Friedman's new offer to pay $37 a share, representing a $1 per share bump, is not nearly sufficient for a company valued at $2.4 billion and growing strongly as low mortgage rates and strong housing demand fuel home decorating. 
CAS said a ""reasonable take-out price"" would be $70 a share. 
At Home agreed to sell itself to H&F last month for $36 a share and said the deal included a 40-day ""go shop"" period to find other potential buyers. This week it said H&F raised its price and will start a tender offer to buy shares instead of letting shareholders vote on the proposed deal, in which a majority would be required for the deal to proceed. 
""H&F’s original offer of $36 per share and its recently revised offer of $37 per share grossly undervalue the Company and deprive stockholders of meaningful value. We urge you to reject H&F’s insufficient tender offer,"" CAS founder and portfolio manager Clifford Sosin wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. He added that certain other shareholders are also opposing the ""insufficient, conflict-ridden deal.""
Representatives for At Home and H&F did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The board of directors' special committee is trying to ""usher through a fire sale,"" Sosin wrote, adding that it failed to conduct a thorough strategic review and did not consult key shareholders like CAS before ""falling into H&F's arms this spring."" 
Since the deal was announced last month, the company's stock has largely traded between $36 and $37. It closed at $36.76 on Thursday.
Sosin said At Home CEO Lee Bird, who guided some of the company's recent strong growth, stands to make more than $100 million in connection with the deal. He also said Bird has been in talks with H&F since 2017, according to proxy materials, which might have dissuaded other potential buyers from bidding.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Methane menace: Aerial survey spots 'super-emitter' landfills,"By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. waste-management industry has become a darling of environmentally minded investors for its work in recycling trash and harvesting gases from landfills as an alternative fuel.
Leading firms Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) and  Republic Services Inc  (NYSE:RSG) are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, a benchmark for socially conscious investing. The firms' major investors include funds controlled by billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates and wealth-management icon Larry Fink, founder of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), who are both leading advocates for corporate climate action.
But the waste industry may be doing far more harm to the planet than investors think, according to a years-long aerial survey commissioned by California air-quality regulators. The survey found ""super-emitter"" landfills accounted for 43% the measured emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane - outpacing the fossil-fuel and agricultural sectors.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Pasadena and leak-detection firm Scientific Aviation have been conducting the flyovers since 2016. They found that some trash dumps operated by top U.S. landfill companies including Republic Services and Waste Management have been leaking methane at rates as much as six times the facility-level estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3vuZrAV on California's ""super-emitter"" landfills).
The ten biggest methane-emitting landfills pumped out the gas at rates averaging 2.27 times the federal estimates, which are produced by waste firms using EPA methodology. 
The California research may have wide-ranging global implications by showing the waste-management industry is playing a bigger role in accelerating climate change than regulators had believed. The surveys could also reveal flaws with United Nations guidelines for estimating methane emissions that are followed by the major governments including the United States, according to scientists involved in the surveys and regulators interviewed by Reuters.
The research could also bring scrutiny on the waste management industry from both policy-makers and green investors - who until now have been focused mainly on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels, said Eliot Caroom, a researcher at TruValue Labs, which provides investors with environmental and social-governance data and analysis.
“One of the largest emitting industries, waste management, deserves more attention,” he said.
Gates - who earlier this year published a book titled, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster - owns more than a third of Republic Services. He owns about 8% of Waste Management through stakes held by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and his personal investment vehicle Cascade Investment LLC, according to fund disclosures. BlackRock owns a 4.6% share of Republic Services and 5% of Waste Management, mainly through funds that track third-party indexes. 
Officials representing Gates and BlackRock did not comment for this story.
Inclusion in the Dow Jones sustainability indices is based on S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) scores for a number of environmental, social and governance criteria. Waste Management has the highest environmental score in the broader commercial services sector and a near-perfect score for climate change strategy. Republic Services also earned high marks for climate strategy.
Officials for Republic Services and Waste Management said they were cooperating with the California flyover surveys.
Waste Management said it was expanding efforts to reduce methane leaks, including better monitoring, adding more soil to cover landfills and capturing the gas for reuse. 
Republic Services said in a statement that the aerial survey data represents snapshot data that may not accurately capture routine emissions at its facility. It called itself a leader in responsible landfill management.
FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS
Methane traps much more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, although for a shorter period of time. All told, one tonne of methane does about 25 times more damage to the climate over a 100-year period than one tonne of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA.
Methane concentrations in the atmosphere have been rising rapidly in recent years, alarming world governments seeking to cap global warming under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Measuring those concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively easy, but tracking the sources of the emissions is hard. That difficulty has become a major stumbling block for global policy-makers hoping to curb the problem.
The United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued guidelines for governments in 2006 on how to estimate methane emissions from landfills without direct measurements such as aerial surveys. Instead, the U.N. has said, methane at landfills can be estimated using factors such as the amount and content of waste stored on site and assumed rates of waste decay. Such methods ""really don't do the job anymore,"" said Jean Bogner, a University of Illinois researcher who has studied methane emissions in landfills since the 1970s.
The IPCC said it would revisit its guidelines if U.N. member nations asked it to do so.
The U.N. estimates that landfills and wastewater produce about a fifth of the world’s human-caused methane emissions, behind only agriculture and the oil-and-gas industry.
Landfills produce methane when organic materials like food and vegetation are buried within them, rotting in low-oxygen conditions. The gas can leak out if the soil covering the dump is too thin, for instance, or if pipes intended to capture methane are broken.
About one-fifth of trash in the United States is food, according to the EPA, a major driver of the problem. Methane emissions from landfills are less of a problem in many developing nations, which tend to waste less food and use open-air dumps rather than covering trash with soil, according to the IPCC.
UNDER THE RADAR
On February 26, an airplane flown by Scientific Aviation buzzed about 1,500 feet above the Republic Services’ Forward landfill in Manteca in the Central Valley and snapped a series of pictures using an infrared spectrometer.
Scientists said the image showed the trash dump was emitting more than a quarter tonne of methane into the atmosphere each hour, the climate equivalent of nearly 12,000 cars idling on the nearby freeways. That rate is about six-times higher than the EPA had estimated for the facility.
Previous fly-overs of the facility since 2017 had shown similar readings.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB), which commissioned the survey, hopes the effort to find leaks will eventually help to curb emissions. A month after the February flyover, state inspectors accompanied officials from the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District on a trip to examine the Forward landfill. The group discovered methane leaks that exceeded allowed limits in various locations, issuing two notices of violation to the landfill's operator, according to an inspection report seen by Reuters.
In the most recent series of overflights which began last fall, regulators asked landfill operators to use information relayed to them in real-time from the aerial surveyors to find and fix leaks on the ground. The state is planning to issue a report on the effort later this year.
Many of the leaks are easily fixed by adding more soil or fixing broken pipes meant to capture methane for use as a fuel, said Jorn Herner, head of CARB's research planning, administration and emissions mitigation. 

The Biden administration last month announced it would require more U.S. landfills to install gas-capture systems to help limit methane emissions. A White House official did not comment for this story.
The state hopes to eventually replace the planes with space satellites. California in April announced a $100 million project, backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, to launch satellites in 2023 that will pinpoint large emissions of greenhouse gases from landfills and other sources, such as refineries, pipelines and farms.

While the repayments mark a welcome boost to Treasury coffers, they’re a drop in the ocean compared to the 352-billion cost so far of the government’s effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic and support workers and businesses.
The government’s flagship Covid aid program pays furloughed workers as much as 80% of their wages. It has cost the government 64 billion pounds to date, supporting a total of 11.5 million jobs at one point or another over the past 15 months. It was still supporting some 3.4 million jobs at the end of April, according to the most recent data from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the government’s tax authority.
The data confirmed by HMRC on Friday shows almost 709 million pounds has been paid back by companies that didn’t need to do so. Another 319 million pounds has been clawed back from companies which claimed too much in error. The information was released in response to a freedom of information request from the Financial Times.

(Reuters) -Orphazyme slashed its financial forecasts on Friday after U.S. health regulators rejected its key drug candidate, sending shares in Denmark's first so-called meme stock tumbling 75% in early trading.
Shares in the biotech company, which is yet to have a drug approved or make money, have been on a roller-coaster recently - like other ""meme stocks"" influenced by chatter on social media - as investors took positions ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision. 
Orphazyme said its application for FDA approval of arimoclomol, a treatment for genetic disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C, had not been successful.
As a result, it predicted revenue for the year would be lower than previously expected and its operating loss significantly wider, forcing the company to cut costs.
""Orphazyme has no money and no substantial projects ... Investors have put their money into a completely unrealistic scenario driven by 'meme tendencies',"" broker Nordnet wrote in a note to clients.
Orphazyme, which is listed in Copenhagen and New York, now expects an operating loss of 670-700 million crowns ($107-$112 million) in 2021, against a previous forecast for a loss of 100-150 million crowns.
The company said the FDA in a letter had said additional qualitative and quantitative evidence was needed to show the drug's effectiveness.
""As representative for Orphazyme's shareholders and as a shareholder myself, I am extremely disappointed,"" deputy board chairman Bo Jesper Hansen said in a statement.

The drugmaker said it would remain in dialogue with the FDA and would continue to seek approval for the treatment in Europe.

(Reuters) - Data from clinical trials of three experimental Alzheimer's disease drugs expected to start emerging next year could help shed light on whether U.S. regulators were justified in their controversial approval of a Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) treatment without clear evidence that it works.
In approving Biogen's Aduhelm over the objection of its own panel of outside expert advisers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required a trial to confirm that the medicine will indeed slow progression of the lethal, mind-wasting disease - a process that could take several years - even as the drug is being used by patients.
But data expected much sooner on three drugs that work in a similar manner - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's donanemab, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF)'s gantenerumab, and partners Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) and Biogen's lecanemab - could give the medical community a better sense of whether Aduhelm is up to the job of slowing the ravages of Alzheimer's.
Aduhelm was approved last week based on its ability to clear a type of plaque from the brain that is believed to be a possible cause of Alzheimer's, rather than evidence that it slows disease progression. The FDA contends the plaque removal is likely to benefit patients, an assertion many experts say is unproven.
""I don't feel that we have evidence now that there's a clinical benefit from reducing amyloid,"" said Dr. Henry Paulson, a neurologist who leads the University of Michigan's Alzheimer’s Disease Center. 
""If another independent study of a different anti-amyloid therapy shows a clear clinical benefit, it makes me much more comfortable with continued use of Aduhelm,"" he said.
All four drugs are antibodies aimed at reducing the accumulation of the sticky plaques composed of a protein called beta amyloid found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, a disease that currently afflicts some six million Americans.
Positive data from the three experimental medicines could also provide an indication of future competition for Aduhelm, which was developed in partnership with Eisai and is currently the only drug that targets an underlying cause of the disease.
Large clinical trials of Aduhelm, known chemically as aducanumab, produced contradictory data, with one trial failing and another showing benefit. There was also a potentially serious brain swelling side effect. 
Nevertheless, the FDA approved Aduhelm under its ""accelerated approval"" program with the understanding that Biogen would conduct a post-marking study to demonstrate patient benefit.
FDA officials said other Alzheimer's drugs will not automatically be eligible for that program. ""We can't say right now whether this will be a path for other Alzheimer's drugs, or drugs for other neurodegenerative diseases,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told Reuters. 
'PRECEDENT-SETTING'
Critics say the decision does change the landscape for future drugs.
""This is precedent-setting whether the FDA likes it or not,"" said Dr. Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins public health professor and one of the remaining members of the FDA advisory panel that reviewed Aduhelm. Three members of the panel resigned after the FDA approval.
""That's not to suggest that the next drug that lowers amyloid is a slam dunk or even gets approved. It may not,"" he said.
For the near future, Biogen will have the market to itself, but analysts are watching potential future rivals closely.
""If another drug comes along and maybe doesn't have as many side effects, or maybe has slightly better data, Biogen's position could be jeopardized,"" said Raymond James health policy analyst Chris Meekins. 
Japan's Eisai completed enrollment last month in a pivotal 18-month study of lecanemab in symptomatic early Alzheimer's patients. The drug is also being studied in a large trial of people with evidence of amyloid in their brains who do not yet have symptoms of the disease.
Roche, which has released limited gantenerumab trial findings, said it expects to have data next year from two global late-stage studies of its drug. 

Eli Lilly announced encouraging results in March from a mid-stage study of donanemab and plans to conduct a larger trial. 
""I think it is quite likely that if they can replicate those results it would be approved,"" said Dr. David Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, who quit FDA's advisory panel in protest over the Aduhelm approval.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday, struggling to gain traction at the end of what looks like being a losing week following the Federal Reserve’s latest update.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve indicating the likelihood of raising interest rate raises in 2023, a year earlier than expected, has hit large parts of the equity markets as investors begin to adjust to a reality without the very easy funding conditions that the central bank ensured as the pandemic hit economic activity.
On Thursday, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6%, broad-based S&P 500 closed 0.1% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, gaining 0.9%.
For the week to date, the Dow has fallen 1.9%, the S&P 500 has dropped 0.6%, while the Nasdaq has gained 0.7%.
This change in tone happened after investment flows into global equity funds jumped to the highest in three weeks in the week ended June 16, although it was European equities that received the most attention.
Global equity funds received a net $10.3 billion in the week ended June 16, compared with about $13 billion outflows in the previous week, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed. 
European equity funds led inflows, luring $8.6 billion, while U.S. equity funds and Asian equity funds had net purchases worth $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
There are no economic numbers of note due later and the earnings slate is largely empty. But it's a triple witching Friday, with options and futures on indexes and equities set to expire, which could lead to a volatile trading day.
In corporate news, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will be in the spotlight after the software giant easily beat second-quarter targets after the close Thursday, while retailer Kroger (NYSE:KR) raised its guidance for 2021. 
Crude oil prices weakened further Friday, continuing to slip in the wake of the stronger dollar on the back of the hawkish Fed tone, but remained near multi-year highs.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.5% at $70.69 a barrel, while Brent was down 0.7% at $72.59.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, hit a more than two-month high earlier Friday, and is on course for a weekly gain of 1.5%, its largest since September.
A stronger dollar makes oil priced in the U.S. currency more expensive in other currencies, potentially weighing on demand. That said, losses have been limited, and the two benchmark oil contracts remain near multi-year highs, still on course to end the week largely unchanged.  
On Wednesday, Brent settled at its highest price since April 2019 while WTI settled at its highest since October 2018.
Later Friday, traders will focus on the latest weekly update from Baker Hughes of the number of oil rigs, while the CFTC will release its weekly commitments of traders report.

Global equity funds received a net $10.3 billion in the week ended June 16, compared with about $13 billion outflows in the previous week, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed.

Global equities hit fresh peaks earlier this week on investor bets that higher inflation levels are transitory, and on optimism about broadening economic recovery from the pandemic.
However, the MSCI world equity index has dropped since Wednesday, as U.S. Federal Reserve officials projected interest rate hikes sooner than expected.
The Lipper data showed global bond funds had a net buying of $9 billion in the week ended June 16, although the inflows were the smallest in three weeks.
Global high-yield bonds witnessed net selling of $1.43 billion, the biggest in four weeks. However, inflation-linked bonds continued to lure money flows for the seventh successive week.

Among commodity funds, precious metal funds had some meagre inflows, while energy funds continued to witness outflows for the third consecutive week.
Gold was set to register its worst week in almost nine months, shedding about 4.5% so far, jolted by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields since the Fed's hawkish tilt on Wednesday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Offering Sinovac Biotech COVID-19 vaccines to the public in Singapore for the first time on Friday, several private clinics reported overwhelming demand for the Chinese-made shot, despite already available rival vaccines having far higher efficacy.
Singapore has vaccinated almost half its 5.7 million population with at least one dose of the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Both have shown efficacy rates of well over 90% against symptomatic disease in clinical trials, compared with Sinovac's 51%.
Earlier this week, officials in neighbouring Indonesia warned that more than 350 medical workers have caught COVID-19 despite being vaccinated with Sinovac and dozens have been hospitalised, raising concerns about its efficacy against more infectious variants.
A number of the people rushing for the Sinovac shot on the first day of its availability in Singapore were Chinese nationals, who felt it would make it easier to travel home without going through quarantine.
Singapore allowed the usage of the Sinovac vaccine by private healthcare institutions under a special access route, following an emergency use approval by the World Health Organization (WHO) earlier this month. 
Ong Ye Kung, Singapore's health minister, said on Friday the government is still awaiting critical data from Sinovac before including it in the national vaccination programme.
Meantime, authorities have selected 24 private clinics to administer its current stock of 200,000 doses. The clinics are charging between S$10-25 ($7.5-$18.6 ) per dose.
Serena Wee, CEO of Icon (NASDAQ:ICLR) Cancer Centre, said about 1,000 people have registered so far, exceeding its initial stock of 200 doses. 
Wee Healthfirst, another approved clinic, put a notice at its entrance on Friday, saying it had stopped reservations for the vaccine until next Thursday, citing ""overwhelming demand"". A receptionist said about 1,000 people had registered there.
Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases doctor at Rophi Clinic, also said he had been ""overwhelmed"" by people wanting the Sinovac shot.
Tang Guang Yu, a 49-year-old engineer, was among the Chinese nationals resident in Singapore who waited for the Sinovac shot rather than take a foreign-made vaccine that he thought might not be recognised by authorities back home. 
""No one wants to be quarantined for a month, I don't have so many days of leave,"" Tang told Reuters as he queued outside a clinic.
Travellers to China may have to be quarantined at a facility and at home for up to a month depending on their destination city, regardless of vaccination status, according to the Chinese government website.
Other people said they have more confidence in the Sinovac vaccine since it is based on conventional technology, while those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna use a newly developed messenger RNA platform. 
""The mRNA technology has been around for 30 years, but it has never been injected into human until recently due to COVID-19 emergency, how safe it is?"" asked Singaporean Chua Kwang Hwee, 62, as he lined up outside a clinic to enquire about getting the Sinovac shot.
Singapore's health ministry says persons with a history of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or its components as well as severely immunocompromised individuals should not receive the mRNA-based vaccines.
Sinovac vaccine uses an inactivated or killed virus that cannot replicate in human cells to trigger an immune response. 
In recent weeks, several social media messages have popped up saying inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines, like Sinovac's, provide superior protection against variants than mRNA vaccines. Other messages on platforms have said the mRNA vaccines are less safe.

Authorities have rejected these claims, saying they are safe and highly effective.

An investigation, which began in October 2020, showed test data on belt webbing, used for seatbelts and child safety seats, were doctored at plants in Hikone, Japan and the Philippines, Hisayoshi Iwamitsu, president of JSS Japan, told reporters. 
The test results, which looked at quality of the webbing, were altered to meet legal and client standards.
Iwamitsu said JSS Japan has submitted an investigation report to Japan's transport ministry on Friday.
The company is not planning a recall, he said, since reexamination of the webbing showed no safety issues, and also because the 12 automakers that the company is supplying decided not to implement measures such as car inspections. 
As part of preventive measures, the company introduced an electronic system in March that would prevent data from being falsified, and is working on expanding human resources for quality management, he added.
Takata's faulty airbag inflators caused the auto industry's biggest safety recall and have been linked to numerous deaths and injuries, mainly in the United States.
The investigation also showed that data had been falsified at Hikone plant over a two-decade period until Jan. 2020, overlapping with when Takata was embroiled in airbag scandals.

""In response to the airbag issue, JSS group as a whole made various efforts including establishing a code of conduct and enhancing compliance awareness among employees, especially those involved in quality management,"" JSS Japan's senior legal official Kohei Hamamoto said.

In what the trade group said was a “disaster” for the industry, overall food and drink shipments to the EU in the period were down 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) from the same three months in 2019. The U.K. formally left the EU’s trade bloc in early 2020.
The figures are “a very clear indication of the scale of losses that U.K.” manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU,” Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said in a statement on Friday.
The U.K.’s increased cost of trading with the EU and significant customs delays since Brexit are driving the downturn, according to the statement. The HMRC data show first-quarter exports of fish fell by more than half and whisky slumped by almost a third compared with the same period in 2019.
Exports performed better outside EU markets, clawing back to pre-pandemic levels for countries such as China, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. The U.S. has also suspended tariffs on goods including cashmere, Stilton cheese and Scotch whisky, which is expected to improve exports to the country.

General merchandise and clothing like-for-like sales were up 10.3% and 52.1% year-on-year respectively, as people got ready to socialise again.
Murphy said that while sales last year were focused on core grocery products such as pasta, this year customers were treating themselves to items such as Prosecco more. 
Separately on Friday official data showed British retail sales fell unexpectedly last month as the relaxing of restrictions encouraged spending in restaurants rather than shops.
Tesco, which has a 27% share of Britain's grocery market, said first quarter online sales were up 22.2% year-on-year and up 81.6% on a two year basis.
Total group sales were 13.4 billion pounds ($18.6 billion) up 1% like-for-like and year-on-year.
Tesco kept its guidance for retail operating profit on a continuing operations basis for the 2021-22 fiscal year to recover to be similar to the 2019-20 outcome.
""While the market outlook remains uncertain, I'm pleased with the strong start we've made to the year,"" said Murphy.

Rivals Sainsbury's and Morrisons have also forecast a strong recovery in profits this year as the extra costs of the pandemic reduce.

OSLO (Reuters) -U.S. e-commerce group eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Norway's Adevinta have secured final regulatory approval for a tie-up of their global classified ads businesses, the Norwegian firm said on Friday.
Under a deal struck last year, Adevinta will acquire eBay's Classifieds Group in return for $2.5 billion in cash and 540 million shares, valuing the transaction at around $13 billion at current stock market prices.
The final regulatory approval came from the Austrian competition watchdog after eBay agreed to reduce its ownership stake in Adevinta during the next 18 months, the Norwegian firm said.
The compromise removes the sole outstanding obstacle to the deal following a go-ahead from Britain's Competition and Markets Authority earlier this month.
""Adevinta is pleased to announce that closing of the transaction will be initiated shortly and is expected to complete on or about 25 June,"" the Oslo-listed company said in a statement.
The transaction makes eBay Adevinta's largest shareholder with an overall 44% stake and 33.3% of the vote, and gives the U.S. firm two seats on the company's board. Norway's Schibsted will hold around 39.5% of the votes.
But as part of the deal with Austria's Federal Competition Authority (FCA), eBay must reduce its financial interest in Adevinta to no more than 33% within 18 months of the transaction's closing, Adevinta said.
""The remedies proposed by Adevinta and eBay address the FCA's concern that the transaction could potentially lessen competition in the Austrian market,"" the company said.

Adevinta's shares were up 2.0% to 165.7 Norwegian crowns at 0917 GMT.
As part of the overall deal, Schibsted will buy eBay Classifieds Group's Danish assets from Adevinta for $330 million.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Sumitomo Corp shareholders on Friday rejected a proposal requiring the trading house to align its business with global climate change targets in a victory for the board over activist investors seeking more action on environmental issues.
The proposal, the second climate resolution to be brought before shareholders of a major Japanese company, was supported by shareholders, including Legal & General Asset Management. 
""Resolution No. 5 was rejected,"" a Sumitomo spokesperson told Reuters by email, referring to the proposal's number in the order of business at the meeting. A breakdown of voting was not immediately available. Sumitomo's board in May had recommended voting against the proposal. 
Activist investors are increasingly turning their attention to Japanese companies, using resolutions that have been employed in Europe and the United States to push companies and banks away from investing in, or financing, fossil fuels like coal, which still has strong support in Japan. 
The proposal was ""essential for investors to correctly assess the transition risk and ambition level of the company, when it comes to addressing climate change,"" Eric Christian Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Danish fund manager Nordea Asset Management, told Reuters by email.
The 2015 Paris Agreement requires countries to curb emissions enough to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels to avert the worst effects of climate change. 
Sumitomo is involved in two controversial coal power projects in Southeast Asia, the Van Phong 1 station in Vietnam and the Matarbari plant in Bangladesh, countries that have fast growing energy needs. Sumitomo recently announced it would aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. 
""While we acknowledge the company's net zero commitment for 2050 and recent policy updates, we do not believe these are sufficiently aligned to limit global warming to 1.5C,"" Sachi Suzuki, senior engager at EOS at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), told Reuters by email.

This is ""particularly because its policy for coal power generation allows various exceptions and would not affect the plants already under construction,"" Suzuki said. EOS at Federated Hermes has $1.5 trillion in assets under advice. 
A similar proposal was put before shareholders of Mizuho Financial Group last year and defeated by a margin of around 65%-35%, the bank said at the time.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>","U.S. FCC votes to advance proposed ban on Huawei, ZTE gear","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously on Thursday to advance a plan to ban approvals for equipment in U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies deemed national security threats like Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763).
The vote drew opposition from Beijing. 
Under proposed rules that won initial approval, the FCC could also revoke prior equipment authorizations issued to Chinese companies. 
A Huawei spokesperson, in an email, called the FCC revision ""misguided and unnecessarily punitive."" 
Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the new measures would ""exclude untrustworthy equipment from our communications networks... We have left open opportunities for (Huawei and other Chinese equipment) use in the United States through our equipment authorization process. So here we propose to close that door.""
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the FCC has approved more than 3,000 applications from Huawei since 2018.
The FCC action would prohibit all future authorizations for communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security. 
""The United States, without any evidence, still abuses national security and state power to suppress Chinese companies,"" said Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson at China's foreign ministry. 
""Once again we urge the U.S. to stop stretching the concept of national security and stop politicising economic issues,"" Zhao said at a regular media briefing in Beijing. 
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks.
A group of U.S. lawmakers including Democratic Senator Ed Markey and Republican Senator Marco Rubio praised the FCC action saying it mirrors the goals of bipartisan legislation. They said the FCC voted ""to put national security first by keeping compromised Chinese equipment out of U.S. telecommunications networks.""
The affected companies included the previously designated Huawei and ZTE, as well as Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. 
Huawei said ""blocking the purchase of equipment, based on a 'predictive judgment,' related to country of origin or brand is without merit, discriminatory and will do nothing to protect the integrity of U.S. communications networks or supply chains.""
In August 2020, the U.S. government barred federal agencies from buying goods or services from any of the five Chinese companies.
In 2019, the United States placed Huawei, Hikvision and other firms on its economic blacklist.
Last year, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats to communications networks - a declaration that barred U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies.

The FCC in December finalized rules requiring carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to ""rip and replace"" that equipment. It proposed a reimbursement program for that effort, and U.S. lawmakers in December approved $1.9 billion to fund it.
Rosenworcel said the FCC will vote in July to finalize the rules overseeing the reimbursement fund.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators said on Thursday they have opened 30 investigations into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of use.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a list offering details about crashes under review by its Special Crash Investigations programs.
The agency had already confirmed some specific Tesla crash investigations but had not previously released to Reuters a full accounting of all Tesla crashes investigated where Tesla's Autopilot system was suspected of being involved.
Of the 30 Tesla crashes, NHTSA has ruled out Tesla's Autopilot in three and published reports on two of the crashes.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters first sought a full list from NHTSA more than a year ago under a public records request. The list only includes the state and month the crashes occurred.
Previously, NHTSA said it had opened 28 special crash investigations into Tesla crashes, with 24 pending. The spreadsheet shows a February 2019 crash where Autopilot use was undetermined.
Autopilot, which handles some driving tasks, was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said. The NTSB has criticized Tesla's lack of system safeguards for Autopilot, which allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.
The spreadsheet shows NHTSA has opened eight investigations into Tesla crashes since March.
The issue has gotten new attention after a fiery April 17 Texas crash that killed two men in Texas in which police had said they believed no one was behind the wheel.
The National Transportation Safety Board said in May that testing suggested the vehicle's automated steering system was ""not available"" on the road where the accident occurred.
On Wednesday, Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell cited Tesla crashes as the panel voted against moving ahead with regulations to speed the adoption of self-driving cars.
""It seems like every other week we're hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot"" Cantwell said.
Separately, NHTSA has conducted no new tests after it withdrew its designation last month that some newer Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as having four advanced safety features after the automaker said it was removing radar sensors to transition to a camera-based Autopilot system.
The agency said Thursday that after discussions with Tesla it restored the lane departure warning designation after Tesla confirmed the technology was unaffected.
NHTSA said in a statement it has ""not yet finalized the list of Model Year 2022 vehicles"" for testing.
The spreadsheet also notes NHTSA has opened six other investigations into six other crashes involving driver assistance systems, including two involving Cadillac vehicles in which there were no reported injuries.
The other four include two involved a 2012 Lexus RX450H and 2017 Navya Arma in which there were no reported injuries. 

The remaining two involved 2017 Volvo XC90 vehicles, including an Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) self-driving test vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Arizona in 2018.
Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash's cause and deactivated the automatic emergency braking systems in the Volvo XC90 vehicle, safety investigators found.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - FirstRand has found offering banking to cash-only businesses in South African townships trickier than expected, but the firms involved are also far bigger than it realised. 
Africa's biggest lender by market capitalisation announced the takeover of financial technology firm Selpal in March, with the aim of capturing a greater slice of the township economy.
Millions of people live in townships, which were areas designated for non-whites under apartheid and are often satellites of South Africa's major cities. 
Wealthy residents, golf courses and shopping malls are also now a feature of the country's most populous township, Soweto, near Johannesburg, as well as a large poorer population living hand-to-mouth in often cramped conditions. 
Townships are also home to millions of firms from tiny informal shops to big wholesalers, historically ignored by major banks in South Africa, which make up a sizeable untapped market.
After almost three years, FirstRand has found that the scale of the unbanked businesses is much larger than it thought, Jesse Weinberg, head of the small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) customer segment at FirstRand's retail division FNB, said.
It has been giving firms Selpal devices and software, which allow customers to pay via card and enable the firms to buy from suppliers, with a view to using the data collected to later offer them financial services such as loans for the first time. 
Although it had not met its original goal of capturing 2,500 wholesalers by 2022, Weinberg said FirstRand had surpassed this figure for the total of firms signed on. The bank has also changed its definition of wholesaler and now estimates there are only 20-30 of these in an average township.
It also found far bigger cash-only wholesalers than anticipated, with some achieving turnover as high as 40 million rand ($2.84 million) a month, Weinberg said, a figure that firms at the higher end of its SME category only do annually.
Even very small township shops typically turn over 2 million rand a year, he said, although their margins are very thin. 
""That would suddenly put that customer into quite a significant bracket, it's a decent size of business,"" he said. 
Early lending pilots had also entailed surprises. 
One pilot testing a product that worked in a similar to way to trade credit, which allows businesses to pay suppliers for stock or services later, saw some business owners turn it down.
Those that did take part became so nervous about their negative account balance that in some cases they began avoiding interaction with Selpal agents altogether.

""It caused a bit of confusion,"" Weinberg said, adding the bank would re-introduce credit pilots at a later stage.

""Under these circumstances, and in order to ensure the company emerges from the pandemic as a strong and healthy airline, the company announced today that it has reluctantly concluded that it must continue to defer the payment,"" the airline said in a statement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest supermarket chain Woolworths Group is being sued by the country's industrial relations watchdog for underpaying staff, more than a year after the retailer admitted not paying thousands of workers in full.
The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) On Thursday filed civil proceedings at the Federal Court seeking the repayment of outstanding amounts it alleges Woolworths still owes its workers, as well as penalties against the supermarket giant.
After closely reviewing a sample of 70 employee files out of about 19,000 workers that were allegedly underpaid, the regulatory body found Woolworths had only back-paid about 40% of the A$1.172 million it still owed those people.
The regulator wants the court to force Woolworths ""to rectify the total outstanding underpayments in relation to the 70 managers whose records were assessed and ... to then apply those calculation methods to rectify any underpayments owed to all other affected salaried managers, plus interest and superannuation,"" it said in a statement on Friday.
Woolworths said in a statement it was reviewing the proceedings and continued to remediate affected staff, and that there was ""considerable uncertainty"" about the issues raised by the proceedings. So far, it had repaid A$370 million to current and former employees, it added. Shares in the company fell 1.8% while the wider market was 0.31% higher.
In October 2019, Woolworths admitted that it had underpaid thousands of supermarket workers for years.
The scandal prompted some politicians to call for a parliamentary inquiry into what they called ""wage theft"" in Australia. [https://reut.rs/3iTmJ0K]
In June 2020, Woolworths booked a one-off A$500 million remediation charge related to the shortfalls.
The FWO did not disclose the magnitude of the penalty it was seeking, as that would be decided by the court if legal action is successful.

The government body was investigating about 90 other companies that had self-reported worker underpayments, including some large listed companies that it declined to name, a spokesperson for the ombudsman said.
""We investigate each self-report made by a corporate entity, and we expect these employers to fully co-operate with our investigations to ensure that employees are quickly repaid their entitlements. Our investigations include a rigorous analysis of how those rectifications are completed to ensure they are accurate.""

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 11:01PM ET</span>",Chinese scientists ensnared in U.S. visa fraud legal battle,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For Chinese brain researcher Song Chen, a visiting scholar at Stanford University when she was arrested last July on a visa fraud charge, a court hearing last month in San Francisco brought some hope.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup expressed skepticism about the FBI's failure to inform Song of her rights when she was first interrogated, calling its tactics a ""gimmick."" He'd previously rejected requests from the prosecution that evidence in her case be kept secret on national security grounds, a decision the U.S. government is appealing. 
But Song, who sat tense and teary-eyed through the proceedings, is still a long way from a trial date as the case winds through the courts. She also has been charged with lying to investigators and destroying evidence as part of an alleged effort to conceal ties to the Chinese military.
Song, who works for the Xi Diaoyutai Hospital in Beijing, a military facility, pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies being an active-duty member of China's military. She is currently free on bail.
Her case is one of at least five visa fraud prosecutions of university researchers launched last year as part of the U.S. Department of Justice's ""China Initiative,"" a three-year-old effort aimed at preventing the transfer of U.S. technology to China. All the Chinese scientists have pleaded not guilty to falsifying visa applications to conceal military ties as well as other charges.
Two of those arrested - Wang Xin, a visiting medical researcher at the University of California San Francisco, and Zhao Kaikai, a PhD student in artificial intelligence at Indiana University Bloomington - are still in jail awaiting trial.
If convicted, the scientists could face a lengthy prison sentence, though lawyers for two of them say it is more likely they would spend a short time in jail, if any time at all, before being sent back to China.
Civil liberties groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian Law Caucus are increasingly concerned about the visa fraud cases, which they say reflect anti-China bias. Defense lawyers say their clients' real crime is running afoul of U.S.-China politics. 
""The government's 'China Initiative' has been framed in dangerous, over-broad terms since its inception, casting widespread suspicion on people of Chinese descent,"" said Patrick Toomey, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU. ""The initiative was supposed to combat the theft of trade secrets, but this case, like so many others, contains no such allegations.""
A senior DOJ official said the prosecutions were based on ""conduct,"" not race. When academics are charged with visa fraud, the DOJ isn't necessarily expecting to later find evidence of espionage or theft, the official said on condition of anonymity.
Rather, the official said, the goal is to prevent actions that are ""pernicious and ultimately could lead to theft.""
China's foreign ministry told Reuters in a statement that the visa fraud cases amounted to ""political persecution."" A total of nearly 300 Chinese students were stopped at U.S. airports for interrogations as they were leaving the country between May and September of last year, the statement added.
The China Initiative was launched under former President Donald Trump, and all five arrests occurred a year ago when U.S.-China relations were at a nadir. President Joe Biden's administration currently has no plans to pull back, the DOJ official said.
'WHY HIM? WHY NOW?'
The Association of American Universities, a lobbying group, says its members understand the need for protection of technology developed at U.S. universities. But they say the government should set clearer vetting policies and standards.
U.S. visa applications specifically ask applicants to state whether they have served in the military and to provide the dates of service. In Song's case, she acknowledged that she had served in the military for about 11 years and she correctly listed the address of the hospital where she was working in the employment field.
Emily Weinstein, a Georgetown University researcher with a focus on China's strategy of merging certain military and civilian functions, said not all workers at a military hospital would be on ""active duty."" 
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a government panel convened to advise Congress on high-tech competitiveness, recommended earlier this year more disclosure on research funding and partnerships at universities, and proposed creating a database of individuals and entities to flag risks in advance. Congress is considering the recommendations.
Critics of the ""China Initiative"" say such measures would assure that better screening takes place during the visa process, rather than after the fact.
Guan Lei, another of the five visa fraud defendants and a computer science student and visiting scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, was charged with lying about his military affiliations.
Guan's university in China, the National University of Defense Technology in Changsha, has been since 2015 on a U.S. Commerce Department trade black list that includes military-affiliated entities, and his supporters say the U.S. government should have brought up that affiliation as a red flag before issuing the visa. Guan told the FBI his school in China has ""normal"" students and soldiers, and that he is not part of the military.
Guan's former lawyer, Bin Li, who took the unusual step of stepping down from the case to help Guan personally, including posting his bail bond, said at least two students from Guan’s school came to UCLA to study with the same professor in prior years and never had any problems.
""Why him? Why now,"" Li asked.

In some of the cases, apparent efforts at evading federal agents or hiding evidence have added to prosecutors' suspicions. Tang Juan, a researcher at the University of California, Davis who is one of the five accused Chinese scientists, initially took refuge at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco after being interrogated by FBI agents and was arrested nearly a month later. 
A federal judge last week ruled that statements that Tang made to federal agents in their initial interrogation could not be used in court because she was not informed of her right to remain silent. The government has filed a motion contesting that ruling.

1178,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 10:29PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Investors Unwind Some Reflation Trades","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Friday morning, with investors unwinding some of the reflation trades that have marked 2021 to date.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.31% by 10:22 PM ET (2:22 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) due to hand down its policy decision later in the day.
BOJ is widely expected to keep its massive stimulus firmly in place and could extend the deadline for its COVID-19-relief program in its decision. They both indicate that the country's fragile economic recovery and tepid inflation mean any exit from the current ultra-easy policy remains a long way off.
Data released earlier in the day also said that Japan’s national core consumer price index grew 0.1% year-on-year, in line with forecasts prepared by Investing.com and higher than the 0.1% contraction recorded in April.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.42%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.76%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.10% while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.69%. The Federal Communications Commission voted 4 to 0 vote on Thursday to ban products from Huawei Technologies Co. and four other Chinese electronics companies.
U.S. shares saw little change, even as the latest cyclical stock rotation round pushed NASDAQ to another record. However, the benchmark S&P 500 was flat as the previous session ended.
Treasury yields steadied earlier in the session as investors were believed to be unwinding bets on a steeper curve. Yields tumbled on Thursday thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling that monetary-policy tightening could start sooner than previously thought in its policy decision handed down earlier in the week.
The central bank caught investors by surprise when it indicated that it was ready to begin discussing asset tapering earlier than expected in its decision. The Fed will also likely raise interest rates earlier than expected, with two hikes planned by the end of 2023.
Investors continued debating the timeline for when the Fed will start trimming its monthly bond purchase, but the decision did help to reduce recent concerns of hyperinflation.
Some investors remained positive.
“What we are seeing here is an interpretation that economic growth is improving and inflation is accelerating, historically both of those are positive for areas like the Nasdaq, tech stocks and even small caps,” Direxion managing director and head of product Dave Mazza told Bloomberg.
“Once we peel the onion a bit, what we are seeing in the data, all of this is generally positive for the economy,” he added."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign automakers' hopes of a booming Indian car market are fading fast as a brutal second wave of COVID-19 infections and limited government room for more stimulus spending suggest a recovery could lag far behind China and the United States. 
Carmakers that saw nearly a decade of Indian sales growth wiped out in 2020 are expecting a bounce back in demand this year. But it is likely to be led by small, affordable cars - a sector dominated by homegrown leader Maruti Suzuki and rival Hyundai - rather than the premium models churned out by most foreign manufacturers, industry executives and analysts say.
With their Indian factories running well below capacity and sales far behind original hopes, firms like Ford, Honda, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Skoda and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) face difficult decisions about future investments.
""It is a survival issue,"" said one senior executive with a Western automaker who declined to be named. 
""Choosing to remain in India depends on the cost benefit analysis of other international markets,"" the executive added, forecasting that, if the outlook remains grim, the number of automakers in the country could fall.
India has already seen General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) shut up shop last year.
Anurag Mehrotra, managing director at Ford India, told Reuters the car market had not grown as projected and COVID had made matters worse, hurting domestic sales and exports.
""The uncertainty in the long-term growth prospects of the auto industry and economy have resulted in serious challenges, including capacity utilisation,"" Mehrotra said. 
He said the pandemic demanded ""agile solutions and tough decisions,"" but did not give details of Ford's plans. The U.S. automaker has said previously it is working on a new plan for India.
Volkswagen, which revised its India strategy in 2018 putting its sister company Skoda in charge, reiterated its plan to invest $1.2 billion to corner 5% of the market by 2025 with new launches, starting with two SUVs this year.
The ambition is to continue building and reinforcing the group's position in the Indian market, a spokesperson for the local unit, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, said.
Honda and Nissan did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
LAGGING BEHIND
A decade ago, India was widely tipped to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020, lagging only the United States and industry leader China, as car ownership per capita among its 1.3 billion people caught up with more mature markets.
Instead, years of high taxes on large cars and SUVs that disproportionately affect foreign automakers, an economic slowdown in 2019 and the pandemic have held it back at No. 5.
The purchasing power of Indian consumers remains far below those in the West, with the weighted average price of a car just $10,000 compared with $38,000 in the United States, according to Ravi Bhatia at consultancy JATO Dynamics.
The long-term potential remains, analysts say, with India home to only around 27 cars per 1,000 people. 
Consultant LMC Automotive expects Indian car sales to surge 35% this year to 3.17 million from almost a decade-low of 2.35 million in 2020. 
But that would still be a fraction of the top markets. LMC sees sales in China rising 7% to 22 million vehicles this year, and climbing 21% in the United States to 13.5 million.
While both China and the United States are putting the pandemic behind them, India is still recovering from a deadly second wave and has fully vaccinated only about 5% of adults.
The extra pressure on public finances has also left India at risk of losing its investment credit rating, limiting its scope for the sort of additional stimulus measures that have helped to boost U.S. and Chinese auto markets.
HIGH HOPES
It is a grim prospect for foreign manufacturers at a time when they are having to invest in electric vehicles and future technologies in more mature, profitable markets.
According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), Ford, Honda, Skoda and Volkswagen saw sales in India drop 20%-28% last fiscal year through March 31, more than twice the decline at Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai.
Utilisation levels have fallen below 30% at some foreign manufacturers' factories, data from SIAM showed. 
That is a far cry from their initial goals.
Nissan had hoped for 5% share of India's car market by 2020 but has less than 1% today. 
Honda told Reuters in 2018 that to be a ""meaningful player"" it needed 10% market share. Its share has fallen to 3% from 5% back then, and it has closed one of two plants in the country.
And Ford, which has invested over $2 billion in India, has less than a 2% share.
To compete in India companies need a steady stream of new products, which needs more investment, said LMC's Ammar Master.
""Automakers with an aged product range face an uphill battle and are at a greater risk of losing sales and market share,"" he said, adding companies like Ford, Nissan and Honda do not currently have strong product pipelines. 
A lack of clarity on export policies and other regulatory hurdles are complicating matters for global carmakers, executives at two of them said.
India last year withdrew its export incentive scheme - crucial for companies like Ford and Volkswagen that ship out more cars than they sell locally - and is yet to finalise a new one.

The absence of free trade agreements between India and export nations is also putting it at a cost disadvantage compared with places like Thailand and Vietnam that have such deals, the executives added.
""India needs to offset its associated risks that hold back multinational automakers from scaling up or investing further,"" said former Ford India executive Vinay Piparsania.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 09:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese apps could face subpoenas or bans under Biden order - sources,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's executive order aimed at safeguarding Americans' sensitive data would force some Chinese apps to take tougher measures to protect private information if they want to remain in the U.S. market, according to people familiar with the matter.
The goal is to keep foreign adversaries like China and Russia from gaining access to large amounts of personal and proprietary business information.
The U.S. Department of Commerce may issue subpoenas to collect information about certain smartphone, tablet and desktop computer software applications. Then the agency may negotiate conditions for their use in the United States or ban the apps, according to people familiar with the matter.
Biden's June 9 order replaced former President Donald Trump's 2020 bans against the popular Chinese applications WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Co, and ByteDance Ltd's TikTok. U.S. courts halted those bans.
U.S. officials share many of the concerns Trump cited in his order banning TikTok, according to one person familiar with the matter. Notably, they fear that China could track the locations of U.S. government employees, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.
While the new order does not name companies, it could end up capturing more apps than the Trump bans and hold up better if challenged in court. Reuters is the first to report details on how the Biden administration plans to implement the order, including seeking support from other countries.
    U.S. officials have begun speaking with allies about adopting a similar approach, one source said. The hope is that partner countries will agree on apps that should be banned. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will decide which apps to target for U.S. action, but they must meet certain criteria. For instance, they must be owned, controlled or managed by a person or entity that supports the military or intelligence activities of a foreign adversary such as China or Russia. 
WECHAT, TIKTOK MAY BE REVIEWED
If Raimondo decides an app poses an unacceptable risk, she ""has the discretion to notify the parties"" directly or publish the information in the government's official daily publication, the Federal Register, a Commerce Department spokesman said. 
    Companies will then have 30 days to object or propose measures to secure data better, the Commerce spokesman said.
The process stems from a May 2019 Trump executive order for reviewing information and communications technology from foreign adversaries. 
Apps from China are most likely to find themselves in the Commerce Department's crosshairs given escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, the Chinese government's ability to exert control over companies and the number of Chinese apps used by Americans.  
    WeChat, TikTok and eight other apps targeted by the Trump administration in its last months are eligible for review by Biden's team, one source said. 
    The Trump targets also included Ant Group's Alipay mobile payment app, WeChat Pay, Tencent Holdings Ltd's QQ Wallet, Tencent QQ, CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate published by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group subsidiary UCWeb and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software’s WPS Office.[L1N2JG2H2] 
    Some of the apps named by Trump have serious data protection issues, while it's unclear why others pose a heightened risk to national security, according to another person familiar with the matter.

The order will apply to business apps, including those used in banking and telecommunications, as well as consumer apps, the first source said.
Apps linked to other adversaries such as Iran or Venezuela are already blocked under broader sanctions.

The bills will be marked up in committee to consider changes and then voted on by the panel to decide whether the full House of Representatives should vote on the measures. 
Two of the bills address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
These bills - one of which would force companies to sell businesses - have attracted the most opposition. Some pro-tech groups have said they could mean the end of popular promotions like Amazon Prime free shipping and iMessage in iPhones.
In addition to the two bills aimed at conflict of interest in platforms' businesses, a third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in. A fourth would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere, including to a competing business.

The House members also introduced a fifth bill, a companion to a measure that has already passed the Senate and would increase the budgets of antitrust enforcers and make companies planning the biggest mergers pay more.
A sixth bill would ensure that state attorneys general are able to remain in the court they select rather than having their cases moved to a court the defendant prefers.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",U.S. senators propose 25% tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Thursday proposed a 25% tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing as Congress works to increase U.S. chip production.
The proposal sponsored by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and the top Republican on the panel, Senator Mike Crapo, along with Senators Mark Warner, Debbie Stabenow, John Cornyn and Steve Daines, would provide ""reasonable, targeted incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing,"" they said in a statement. 
The group did not immediately provide a cost estimate for the measure, which is on top of recent proposed semiconductor funding. Last week, the Senate approved $52 billion for production and research on semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. That included $2 billion dedicated to chips used by automakers, which have seen massive shortages and made significant production cuts. The House of Representatives must still act on the measure.
Supporters of funding note the U.S. share of semiconductors and microelectronics production has fallen to 12% from 37% in 1990. 
The senators said up to 70% of the cost difference for producing semiconductors overseas results from foreign subsidies.
""The United States can’t allow foreign governments to continue to lure companies’ manufacturing overseas, increasing risks to our economy and costing American workers good-paying jobs,"" Wyden said. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month the funding could result in seven to 10 new U.S. semiconductor plants.
Raimondo anticipates government funding would generate ""$150 billion-plus"" in investment in chip production and research - including contributions from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.
The tax credit could benefit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330), which is building a $12 billion semiconductor factory in Arizona, and Dutch chipmaker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) as well as U.S. firms such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).

The Semiconductor Industry Association praised the proposal, saying it said would ""strengthen domestic chip production and research, which are critical to U.S. job creation, national defense, infrastructure, and semiconductor supply chains.""

(Reuters) - Conviction in the strength of the economic recovery pushed investors into U.S. technology stocks on Thursday, driving the Nasdaq higher, although a post-Fed hangover left a subdued S&P nursing a very minor loss.
The marginal decline was the S&P's third negative finish in a row, while the Dow - with a more pronounced drop - posted its fourth straight lower close.
Many investors were still processing the Federal Reserve's unexpectedly hawkish message on monetary policy from the previous day, which projected the first post-pandemic interest rate hikes in 2023.
Fed officials cited an improved economic outlook as the U.S. economy recovers quickly from the pandemic, with overall growth expected to hit 7% this year. While careful not to derail the recovery - with no end in sight for supportive policy measures such as bond-buying - the rate-rise signal highlighted concerns about inflation.
""I think there was a scenario that people had in mind, that the Fed was going to allow for a larger and longer inflation overshoot, and I think with the increase in the dot plot yesterday... people are rethinking that scenario,"" said David Lefkowitz, head of equities for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Technology shares, which generally perform better when interest rates are low, powered a rally on Wall Street last year as investors flocked to stocks seen as relatively safe during times of economic turmoil.
Investors returned to such positions on Thursday. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp jumped 4.8%, posting its fourth consecutive record close, after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) raised its price target on the stock.
Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shook off premarket declines to advance between 1.3% and 2.2% as investors bet that a steady economic rebound would boost demand for their products in the long run.
The Nasdaq ended 13 points short of its record finish on Monday, but it was still the index's second-highest close ever.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 210.22 points, or 0.62%, to 33,823.45, the S&P 500 lost 1.84 points, or 0.04%, to 4,221.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 121.67 points, or 0.87%, to 14,161.35.

Interest rate-sensitive bank stocks slumped 4.3% as longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields dropped. 
The strengthening dollar, another by-product of the previous day's Fed news, pushed U.S. oil prices down from the multi-year high hit earlier in the week. The energy index, in turn, was off 3.5%, the biggest laggard among the 11 main S&P sectors. 
Other economically sensitive stocks, including materials and industrials, fell 2.2% and 1.6% respectively as data showed jobless claims rising last week for the first time in more than a month. Still, layoffs appeared to be easing amid a reopening economy and a shortage of people willing to work.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.77 billion shares, compared with the 10.67 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 37 new lows.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>",Ford sees better-than-expected quarterly profit on higher vehicle prices,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Thursday its second-quarter operating profit will exceed expectations due to lower costs and rising prices for new and used vehicles amid the global semiconductor chip shortage.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley also said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference that the No. 2 U.S. automaker will eventually raise its spending on electric vehicles beyond the $30 billion-plus through 2025 that it outlined last month. He added the Argo AI self-driving software startup, in which Ford invested, will need more funding in the future.
Ford will provide a more detailed forecast for the second half of the year when it reports second-quarter results on July 28. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company previously said the chip shortage would cost it $2.5 billion this year and halve vehicle production in the second quarter.
Farley said the availability of chips will not return to normal in the auto industry until some time next year. He added that Ford had been harder hit than other automakers by the fire at a Japanese plant of Renesas Electronics Corp which affected chip production.
However, the chip shortage has also led to lower vehicle inventories, causing consumers to pay higher prices for new cars as well as used cars at vehicle auctions, benefitting Ford Credit, the company said.
""It's just strengthening every day - pretty breathtaking actually,"" Farley said, referring to vehicle pricing for new and used cars.
Ford also cited high interest in several vehicles, including the recently launched Bronco SUV, which has 125,000 orders. The company has 100,000 reservations for the F-150 Lightning electric pickup that will launch next spring. 

As far as the rollout of EVs in the United States, Farley said the Biden administration should fashion incentives that benefit both consumers who buy EVs as well as factory workers who produce them. The United Auto Workers union has praised a bill under consideration that would give extra incentives for American-made and union-made EVs. 
Ford also said that its net income for the second quarter will be substantially lower than a year ago, when it benefitted from a $3.5 billion gain on its investment in Argo.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said Thursday it will give $5 million to four historically Black universities to help expand their engineering programs for designing the chips that power electronic devices.
Apple said the $5 million will be spread across Alabama A&M University, Howard University, in Washington, D.C., Morgan State University, in Baltimore, and Prairie View A&M University, in Texas, over three years. The money comes from Apple's broader racial justice initiative, which it announced last year with $100 million in initial funding. 
The grants will support each school's engineering departments and seek to focus expanding course work in fields like computing architecture and designing chips. The money will also support fellowships and internships in hardware technologies, Apple said.

Apple custom designs many of the chips in its flagship devices, including central processors in its Mac computers and iPhones and special chips in its AirPods headphones that help them work smoothly with other Apple devices.
""We know many jobs of the future will be in innovative areas like silicon engineering and we want to help ensure the leaders of tomorrow have access to transformational learning opportunities,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in a statement.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Acciona said on Thursday it was targeting a valuation of up to 9.8 billion euros ($11.66 billion) for its energy business following the listing of up to 25% of this unit, in what is set to be one of the biggest in a record year so far for listings in Europe.
The deal targets a lower valuation than the 12.1 billion euros achieved by Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s infrastructure unit Vantage Towers in a blockbuster deal in March but higher than the 7.6 billion pounds ($10.58 billion) achieved by British online food company Deliveroo in March.
The energy and infrastructure group said in a statement it planned to price its energy unit on the domestic stock market at between 26.73 euros and 29.76 euros per share, raising as much as 2.45 billion euros without taking into account an over-allotment option to the joint global coordinators of the deal.
The planned IPO, which initially offers between 15% and 25% of its renewable business and is the largest in Spain in more than six years, has been one of the most closely watched deals in Europe.
Renewable energy stocks have pulled back from their January highs, casting some doubt over whether the sector would be as warmly viewed by investors as previously. Smaller renewable firm OPDenergy pulled a planned Madrid IPO earlier this year, while Ecoener downsized its transaction.
Investors are clamouring for businesses that can help the world's economies shift away from fossil fuels and stave off potentially catastrophic climate change.
With the so-called greenshoe option of between 10% and 15% of the offer, the deal could be worth up to 2.817 billion euros.
The IPO, addressed to qualified investors, will be carried out through the placement by parent company Acciona of ordinary shares of its unit, under the terms set in the prospectus to be submitted to the CNMV, it said.
The price range would give its energy unit a valuation of between 9.8 billion euros and 8.8 billion euros, higher than the current group's valuation of 7.56 billion euros.

Acciona said its renewables energy unit would apply for admission to negotiation on the Spanish stock market without providing a date.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street was broadly under pressure on Thursday and European shares fell for the first time in two weeks on hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve, even as U.S. technology stocks notched gains.
The U.S. dollar hit a two-month high and long-dated Treasury yields whipsawed, tumbling after initially spiking on Wednesday's surprise move from the Fed to raise interest rates at a much faster pace than expected.
U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose, briefly lifting bullion prices off the session's steepest losses. Crude oil futures tumbled from multi-year peaks, under pressure from the dollar. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower for a fourth straight session, down 0.62%, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.04%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite neared its lifetime peak hit on April 29, before closing up 0.87% as investors bet the economic recovery would boost demand.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) all shrugged off pre-market losses. 
Europe's STOXX 600 snapped a nine-day streak of gains - its longest since 2017 - with a 0.12% dip and MSCI's gauge of global stocks shed 0.41%.
The Fed on Wednesday signaled it would now be considering whether to taper its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase program meeting by meeting, and downgraded the risk from the pandemic given progress with vaccinations.
Traders are ""again buying Treasuries and technology stocks as the market continues to believe that, despite yesterday’s Fed meeting, the central bank is still planning on keeping interest rates near zero or extremely low for another 18-24 months,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of the Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Two-year and five-year notes, the most sensitive to interest changes, saw the largest yield increases on the hawkish Fed move. 
Long-dated yields dropped as traders who were betting on the yield curve scrambled to cover their trades. Yields on 10-year bonds matched Wednesday's high of 1.594% before retreating. [US/]
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts noted Fed Chair Jerome Powell had not been as aggressive in his news conference. He had described it as a ""talking about talking about meeting,"" a reference to his protestations earlier this year that the Fed was not even ""talking about talking about"" tighter policy.
""It appears that faster progress toward reopening and higher inflation surprises revealed some hawks on the FOMC, but we suspect that leadership is predominantly anchored at zero or one hike in 2023,"" JPMorgan said, sticking with a prediction for tapering to start early next year.
Some are beginning to expect the Fed to dial back purchases sooner. Bond giant Pimco's U.S. economists said the tapering plan might now be announced as soon as September, and that it would take roughly six to nine months to wind down the stimulus.
""The more hawkish changes to FOMC participants’ rate path expectations came despite little change in the 2023 unemployment rate and inflation forecasts,"" Pimco said, ""This suggests less tolerance for an inflation overshoot than previously thought.""
Increasingly confident in the U.S. economic recovery, the Fed is seen most likely starting to taper in January, according to a Reuters poll.
""Given another strong rise in the upcoming May core PCE data, July’s FOMC could well bring a very hawkish outcome to this talk, especially if nonfarm payrolls for June are over 1 million and prior months are revised up significantly,"" John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, said in a market note.
DOLLAR BREAKS FREE
The dollar broke out of recent tight ranges, surging to a two-month high as it extended Wednesday's 0.9% increase against a basket of currencies. [FRX/] 
Colombia's peso led Latin American currency losses on Thursday, dropping 1.5% on the dollar's strength. Brazil's real was the outlier, holding near one-year highs on expectations of more central bank policy tightening.
Powell's hawkish turn prompted both Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to abandon their calls that the U.S. currency would weaken against the euro, although others were not so sure. 
Agnès Belaisch, chief European strategist of the Barings Investment Institute, said the fact that the Fed was not going to lift rates anytime soon was good for world growth and that FX markets would therefore get over Wednesday's shift.
""He (Powell) said they wouldn't do anything for the next two years, so it's a shock but wrapped in good news,"" Belaisch said. ""I think he gave the markets the all-clear to rally."" 
The euro fell to $1.19035 from just over $1.20 in the Asian session after touching the lowest since mid-April.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 05:15PM ET</span>",Analysis: Biden may hinder oil and gas drilling even after court loss,"By Nichola Groom and Valerie Volcovici
(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has the power to stymie oil and gas development on government-controlled lands and waters, industry and environmental experts said, even though a court decision ended his freeze on federal drilling auctions.
Some options, they said, include offering sparse acreage or imposing more time-consuming permitting requirements.
""We lived through the Obama administration, and they did a lot of things to constrain leasing and other activity on federal lands,"" Kathleen Sgamma, president of industry trade group Western Energy Alliance, said in an interview. 
""And frankly they have the power to do so.""
In January, Biden temporarily suspended drilling lease sales on federal lands and waters to weigh the program's environmental costs. The move was widely seen as a first step to delivering on his campaign promise to permanently ban new federal leasing to fight climate change.
Several oil-drilling states sued, arguing the pause was illegal and would hurt their economies. On Tuesday, Louisiana federal court Judge Terry Doughty, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, ordered the government to lift the suspension.
The U.S. Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 says the government must schedule lease sales at least quarterly in ""each state where eligible lands are available"".
Changing that law is unlikely in a politically divided Congress. Yet industry and green groups agree that Biden's Interior Department, which oversees oil and gas development on federal acreage, has plenty of other ways to avoid or at least slow new leasing.
The administration, for example, has the power to decide what ""eligible lands"" are.
Previous administrations have removed areas from consideration for leasing. Trump's Republican administration, for example, deferred leases within 10 miles of New Mexico's Chaco Culture National Historical Park. President Barack Obama, a Democrat who had Biden as his vice president, withdrew parts of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans from offshore drilling eligibility.
“When you think about it, the system can’t operate unless there’s a fair amount of discretion built in,"" said Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at environmental group Earthjustice. ""Otherwise, any oil company could come in at any time and demand a lease in location X.""
In the coming weeks, Biden's Interior Department is expected to release a report with recommendations on how to reform the century-old oil and gas leasing program, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said on Wednesday. 
The Department declined to comment on whether it will hold new lease sales, but said it will honor the court ruling.
If Interior resumes leasing, it has the authority to do so with strict stipulations and prolonged permitting timelines, experts said. It can also put up a limited number of acres up for auction, frustrating bidders.
The industry is anticipating that Interior will prolong the review of potential lease areas using the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires that federal agencies assess the environmental impacts of projects.
""NEPA is a great tool for paralysis by analysis... we will see NEPA take longer,"" Sgamma said.
The Biden administration has argued that reforms to the programs are needed in part because the Trump administration failed to conduct thorough reviews of lease areas. That resulted in many canceled leases and set back Trump's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production.
“Every time we challenged lease sales in the courts, we were able to demonstrate there was a failure to account for the climate crisis and we prevailed in every one of those lawsuits,” said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, director of the Western Environmental Law Center (WELC).

Environmental groups like WELC and WildEarth Guardians are ready to sue again if drilling lease sales resume, according WELC's Schlenker-Goodrich and WildEarth’s climate and energy program director, Jeremy Nichols.
“We hope we don’t have to name Deb Haaland as a defendant in a case. That would really be sad,” Nichols said. “But we have to do what we have to do, and this program is off the rails.""

The CDC also recommended that travelers get tested 1 to 3 days before their trips and 3 to 5 days after their trips.

""Since the virus spreads more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships, the chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high. It is especially important that people who are not fully vaccinated... avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises,"" the CDC said.

The cruise industry and the CDC have been working together to restart cruises after the three big companies, Royal Caribbean, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd incurred huge losses and heavy debts as cruising came to a standstill.
With nearly half of the U.S population fully vaccinated, cruises are in huge demand as consumer are eager to travel after staying at home for over a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Healthcare industry prepares for Obamacare expansion after court ruling,"(Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare industry and analysts praised a U.S. Supreme Court decision that preserved the Obamacare health plan, with insurer CVS reaffirming that it will rejoin the individual insurance exchange and others predicting more federal support.
The nation's highest court preserved the landmark law, formally called the Affordable Care Act (ACA), for the third time since its 2010 enactment, declaring that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to file their lawsuit seeking to nullify it.
Shares of health insurers  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) Inc, which participate in the exchanges to buy individual health insurance set up by the law, closed up more than 2% on Thursday. 
In February, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said it would return to selling individual health insurance plans on the online marketplaces created by the ACA, saying the market had stabilized.
""We look forward to bringing innovative solutions and more options to the marketplace as we enter the exchanges in 2022,"" it said on Thursday. 
CVS Health's Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance unit and other large health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) exited these online exchanges in 2017 and 2018, due to financial losses and uncertainty as Republicans tried to repeal the law.
Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback said the Supreme court decision, although largely expected, alleviated uncertainty about the individual exchanges and expansion of the Medicaid health program for low-income Americans. 
""We think CVS and other insurers are primarily being attracted to the individual exchanges and other ACA-related initiatives because of the prospects of more individuals being drawn to the market through steps that the Democrat-controlled federal government is taking to expand access to health insurance,"" Utterback said.
If Obamacare had been struck down, up to 20 million Americans stood to lose medical insurance, cutting revenue for some doctors and hospitals, and insurers again could have refused to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.

Advocacy group America's Health Insurance Plans said ""Americans agree we should continue to build on the ACA,"" while the American Medical Association said it would continue to work for expanded healthcare access.
""We still expect Democrats to pass permanent expansion of exchange subsidies,"" Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said in a note, calling the decision a relief for Republicans, as shifting politics had made the lawsuit a liability.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended flat Thursday as tech was lifted by falling bond yields but gains for the broader market were kept in check by falling cyclical stocks following the Federal Reserve's hawkish turn a day earlier.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.06%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.62%, or 210 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.87%.
The move lower in Treasury yields suggests that we're on a path to lower growth at a time when the Fed's view that inflation is transitory gains in popularity, creating the perfect cocktail for tech as investors look to quench their thirst for growth.
The fall in 10-year break-evens is giving tech ""somewhat of a green light if indeed the Fed is correct on inflation being 'transitory,' just as the long end of the curve implies a low-growth environment ahead (effectively making growth scarce),"" Mark Luschini, chief investment strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Others, however, offer a more simple explanation for the fall in yields: falling supply.
""The supply side of treasuries has come down,"" said Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday​. During the pandemic, the limit on the debt ceiling - how much money the U.S. government can borrow -  was lifted, but it is set to be reimposed on July 31.
Ahead of the deadline, the government is using the cash on its balance sheet, or Treasury General Account, rather than selling of bonds to raise cash for spending. Against this lower supply, the Fed continues to buy bonds, pushing prices higher, and yields lower.
""They're (the government) not issuing as much treasuries as before, yet the Fed is still purchasing $80 billion worth of treasuries every single month, and they're still seeing an increased demand from Europe,"" Wagner added. ""When demand rises and supply declines, you're going to see yields compress, and that's what has been happening right now.""
Tech, however, a big fan of falling yields, didn't seem to care about whether the move in rates will be transitory.
Apart from Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were more than 1% higher.
The semiconductor stocks also bolstered the wider tech sector, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) sharply higher.
Cyclicals, meanwhile, struggled as the rotation from value to growth appears to be in vogue once again.
Financials were dragged down by banks as lower yields hurt net interest margin.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) were down sharply, with the latter down 4%.
Lower interest rates hurt the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their depositors.
When rates do move higher, however, cyclicals – those sectors of the market that move in tandem with the economy - will be the place to be.  
""At the beginning portion of this year, the type of securities that outperformed when you had a high velocity increase in real rates was the high beta cyclical names. Whether the market goes up or down, I think that there's a longer runway for stock appreciation in the more cyclical areas of the market rather than the defensives,"" Wagner said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday threw out a lawsuit accusing Cargill Inc and a Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) subsidiary of knowingly helping perpetuate slavery at Ivory Coast cocoa farms, but sidestepped a broader ruling on the permissibility of suits accusing American companies of human rights violations abroad. 
The 8-1 ruling authored by Justice Clarence Thomas reversed a lower court decision that had allowed the lawsuit, brought on behalf of former child slaves from Mali who worked at the farms, filed against the companies in 2005 to proceed. 
The court ruled the claim could not be brought under the Alien Tort Statute, which lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in American courts in certain instances, because the plaintiffs did not show that any of the relevant conduct took place within the United States. 
""Nearly all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor - providing training, fertilizer tools, and cash to overseas farms - occurred in Ivory Coast,"" Thomas wrote.
The business community has long sought to limit corporate liability under this law.
""Nestle never engaged in the egregious child labor alleged in this suit, and we remain unwavering in our dedication to combating child labor in the cocoa industry,"" a Nestle spokesperson said.
A Cargill spokesperson said the company is committed to keeping child labor out of the cocoa supply chain.
""We do not tolerate the use of child labor in our operations or supply chains and we are working every day to prevent it,"" the spokesperson said.
Paul Hoffman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the ruling ""has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But Hoffman added that he intends to refile the lawsuit with more detailed allegations on conduct that he said took place in the United States.
""It is significant that the court's ruling rejected the most extreme arguments for limiting human rights cases,"" Hoffman said. 
The justices stopped short of definitively deciding the question of whether U.S. companies can ever be sued under the 1789 law. Cargill and Nestle had asked the court to bar such lawsuits in all circumstances.
The lawsuits targeted the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle, the world's biggest food producer, and commodities trader Cargill, one of the largest privately held U.S. companies.
The plaintiffs accused the companies of aiding and abetting human rights violations through their active involvement in purchasing Ivory Coast cocoa and turning a blind eye to the use of slave labor on the farms despite being aware of the practice in order to keep cocoa prices low.
A federal district court in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit twice, most recently in 2017. That court found that the claims were barred by recent Supreme Court decisions that made it harder for plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts for alleged violations overseas.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 revived the claims, citing the allegations that the companies provided ""personal spending money"" to local farmers to guarantee the cheapest source of cocoa. The 9th Circuit found that the payments were akin to kickbacks and that the low price of cocoa was dependant upon the child slave labor.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business interests backed the two companies in the case.
The Supreme Court in 2013 and 2018 cases limited the ability of plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts under the Alien Tort Statute for overseas human rights violations. The court said in those rulings that there needed to be a strong connection between the alleged conduct and actions that took place in the United States.

Lufthansa said passengers would be able to show the digital proof of vaccination either on their phones or on a printout when checking in at the airport, and the boarding pass would then be issued.
""This eliminates the need to juggle different papers and proofs. It also significantly reduces the risk of misuse of fake vaccination certificates,"" Lufthansa said.
Germany started issuing QR codes for those who are fully vaccinated last week.
Germans are booking holidays again at rates higher than in 2019 before the coronavirus hit, TUI Group, the world's biggest holiday group, said on Wednesday.
Lufthansa said on selected routes it would also soon be possible to use the digital vaccination certificate to check in via smartphone using the airline's app.
Passengers who want to check they have the right paperwork can also contact the Lufthansa service centre up to 72 hours before they fly, which can also deal with proof of a negative COVID-19 test, recovery from the virus and also vaccinations.
Lufthansa said it still recommends that passengers carry their original printed vaccination certificates with them on their journey until further notice.
Lufthansa said earlier on Thursday its new subsidary focused on holiday flights, Eurowings Discover, will ramp up operations faster than expected this year, starting with a flight at the end of July from Frankfurt to Mombasa.

European Union countries agreed last week to an easing of travel restrictions over the summer that will allow fully vaccinated tourists to avoid tests or quarantines and broaden the list of EU regions from which it is safe to travel.
Britain is considering easing travel restrictions for double vaccinated people, a move which would placate airlines who are threatening legal action against the government's strict curbs on trips abroad.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 02:44PM ET</span>","Canadian regulator lifts banks' capital buffer to record, priming for post-pandemic world","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's financial regulator raised the amount of capital the country's biggest lenders must hold to guard against risks to a record 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, from 1% currently, in a surprise move that could pave the way for them to resume dividend increases and share buybacks.
The new measures, which take effect on Oct. 31, is a sign that the economic and market disruptions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic have abated and banks' capital levels have been resilient, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) said in a statement.
But the regulator acknowledged that key vulnerabilities, including household and corporate debt levels, as well as asset imbalances caused by steep increase in home prices over the past year, remain.
In a sign of concern about the housing market, OSFI and the Canadian government raised the benchmark to determine the minimum qualifying rate for mortgages, starting June 1. 
The increase in the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) to the highest possible level raises the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital - the core bank capital measure - to 10.5% of risk-weighted assets; a 4.5% base level, a ""capital conservation buffer"" of 2.5%, and a 1% surcharge for systemically important banks, plus the DSB.
The change ""gives OSFI more leeway to loosen a restriction down the road, namely the freeze on buybacks and dividend increases,"" National Bank Financial Analyst Gabriel Dechaine said. 
OSFI felt it was ""useful for the banks to understand what our minimal capital expectations are and to give them time to adjust to that... ahead of any lifting of the temporary capital distribution restrictions,"" Assistant Superintendent Jamey Hubbs said on a media call. 
Even with the higher requirement, Canada's six biggest banks would have excess capital of about C$51 billion, dropping from C$82 billion as of April 30, according to Reuters calculations. 
That was driven in part by a moratorium on dividend increases and share buybacks imposed by OSFI in March 2020, although a pandemic-driven surge in loan losses has so far failed to materialize.
The Canadian banks index slipped 0.25% in morning trading in Toronto, while the Toronto stock benchmark fell 0.1%. 
The increase is the first since the last one announced in December 2019, which did not come into effect as planned in April 2020, as OSFI made an out-of-schedule change https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-mortgages-regulation-idUSL1N2B636J that dropped the rate to 1% in March. It has maintained that level at its twice yearly reviews.

Prior to that, OSFI had raised the required level by 25 basis points at every twice yearly review since it was introduced at 1.5% in June 2018.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 02:42PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rejects Trump-backed challenge to Obamacare,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a Republican bid backed by former President Donald Trump's administration to invalidate Obamacare, preserving the landmark healthcare law for the third time since its 2010 enactment.
The 7-2 ruling declared that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to file their lawsuit seeking to nullify a law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, that has enabled millions of Americans to obtain medical coverage either through public programs or private insurers. The decision was authored by liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.
The justices did not decide broader legal questions raised in the case about whether a key Obamacare provision was unconstitutional and, if so, whether the rest of the statute should be struck down. The provision, called the ""individual mandate,"" originally required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a financial penalty.
""Today's U.S. Supreme Court decision is a major victory for all Americans benefiting from this groundbreaking and life-changing law,"" said Democratic President Joe Biden, whose administration opposed the lawsuit. 
With three major challenges to Obamacare now having been resolved by the justices, Biden added, ""it is time to move forward and keeping building on this landmark law."" Biden also encouraged more Americans to use Obamacare to obtain coverage.
Polling data has shown that Obamacare has become increasing popular among Americans, including Republicans.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who led the challenge, vowed to continue to fight Obamacare. The individual mandate, Paxton wrote on Twitter, ""was unconstitutional when it was enacted and it is still unconstitutional.""
The law was the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama, who Biden served with as vice president.
""This ruling reaffirms what we have long known to be true: the Affordable Care Act is here to stay,"" Obama said.
Breyer wrote that none of the challengers, including Texas and 17 other states and the individual plaintiffs, could trace a legal injury to the individual mandate, partly because a Republican-backed tax law signed by Trump in 2017 had wiped out the financial penalty. 
""Unsurprisingly, the states have not demonstrated that an unenforceable mandate will cause their residents to enroll in valuable benefits programs that they would otherwise forgo,"" Breyer wrote.
Twenty states including Democratic-governed California and New York and the Democratic-led House of Representatives intervened in the case to try to preserve Obamacare after Trump had refused to defend the law.
Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the ruling. Alito called the decision an example of ""judicial inventiveness"" and labeled the individual mandate ""clearly unconstitutional.""
Republicans fiercely opposed Obamacare when it was proposed, failed to repeal it when they controlled both chambers of Congress and have been unsuccessful in getting courts to invalidate the law, including in 2012 and 2015 Supreme Court decisions. 
Biden's administration in February urged the Supreme Court to uphold Obamacare, reversing the position taken by the government under Trump, who left office in January.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee whose 2020 confirmation hearing included questions from Democrats over whether she would vote to invalidate Obamacare, joined the majority in the ruling.
'RELENTLESS EFFORTS'
If Obamacare had been struck down, up to 20 million Americans stood to lose medical insurance and insurers again could have refused to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Obamacare expanded the Medicaid state-federal healthcare program and created marketplaces for private insurance.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called the ruling a ""victory for Democrats' work to defend protections for people with pre-existing conditions against Republicans' relentless efforts to dismantle them.""
Biden has pledged to expand healthcare access and buttress Obamacare. He and other Democrats had criticized Republican efforts against Obamacare at a time when the United States was grappling with a deadly coronavirus pandemic.
Despite the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority, the Republican Obamacare challengers came away disappointed in a ruling in which all three liberal justices were joined by four of the six conservative justices. Opposition to Obamacare seems to have receded as a political issue for many Republicans as their party has emphasized other matters such as immigration, voting restrictions and hot-button ""culture war"" issues.

The Supreme Court previously upheld Obamacare by deeming the financial penalty under the individual mandate a tax permissible under the U.S. Constitution's language empowering Congress to levy taxes. The penalty's elimination in 2017 meant the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and was therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued. 
A federal judge in Texas in 2018 ruled that Obamacare, as structured following the 2017 change, violated the Constitution and was invalid in its entirety. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but did not rule that the entire law should be stricken.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Websites of dozens of financial institutions and airlines in Australia and the United States were briefly down on Thursday, in the second major blackout in just over a week caused by a glitch in an important piece of internet infrastructure. 
Server-related glitches at content delivery network (CDN) provider Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) had hampered services at Australian banks, while many U.S. airlines, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), also reported an hour-long outage.
The disruption linked to technical issues at Akamai follows an outage at rival Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) Inc that affected a number of popular websites last week.
The impacted platform is now up and running, an Akamai spokesperson said, adding that the company was ""continuing to validate services.""
The outage was caused by a bug in Akamai's software that has since been fixed, and was not caused by a cyber-attack or vulnerability, the spokesperson added.
Akamai is one of the largest providers of CDN services, which are used by companies to speed up the delivery of data-heavy content, videos and games to web pages.
Several U.S. websites, which were hit by the outage, were back up on Thursday. 
""Our website and other internet-based tools are back up and running today after a brief outage late Wednesday evening,"" Southwest spokesperson said in a statement. 
""We are continuing to look into the root cause of last night's outage but it's believed to be related to the broad Akamai outage.""
American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were not immediately available for comment.
In Australia, websites of the central bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY),  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group had begun to come back online by late afternoon.

Virgin Australia said it was ""one of many organisations to experience an outage with the Akamai content delivery system,"" though the situation was now resolved.

Here’re 3 Other Furniture Stocks That Could Surge,"An increased focus on remodeling and decorating living spaces as part of a widespread embrace of remote lifestyles has been driving the furniture industry’s growth. Propelled by the industry tailwinds, the price of RH’s (RH (NYSE:RH)) stock has rallied nearly 160% over the past year. The good news is that we think investors that failed to cash in on RH’s surge could still benefit from the industry tailwinds by betting on Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), Haverty (NYSE:HVT) Furniture Companies (HVT), and  Bassett Furniture  Industries (NASDAQ:BSET).These names still have upside to deliver. Read on.The demand for furniture and related home improvement products has increased significantly thanks to the widespread adoption of remote lifestyles amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The furniture industry is expected to continue seeing solid demand throughout the remainder of 2021 because remote lifestyles are expected to continue, at least in part.
One of the largest upscale home furnishings companies, RH (RH), had a solid rally over the past year, capitalizing on the industry tailwinds. The company’s strong financials helped it become one of the industry’s winners. RH’s net revenue increased 78.3% year-over-year to $860.79 million in its fiscal first quarter, ended May 1, while its net income improved 4,167.7% from its year-ago value to $130.66 million. The company’s EPS increased 2564.7% year-over-year to $4.19. Shares of RH have gained 7.6% since the release of its first quarter results on June 9. The stock has gained 47% year-to-date, and 38.4% over the past three months.
While RH may have run too far too fast, we believe there is still upside remaining in furniture stocks Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM), Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. (HVT), and Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (BSET). These companies have expanded their offerings substantially over the past couple of months and possess strong financials.

Investing.com – Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were up more than 5% Thursday, boosted by Jefferies' (NYSE:JEF)’ revised target of $854 for the stock, an upside of approximately 14% even after accounting for the session’s uptick.
“We see Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the 4th tectonic shift in computing, in which parallel processing captures share in the computing market,” Jefferies’ Mark Lipacis said in a note carrying the Street-high target.
According to Lipacis, Nvidia’s decade-long investment in CUDA has resulted in a multi-year competitive advantage.
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by Nvidia for general computing on graphical processing units.
Lipacis and Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress recently had a chat.
The analyst believes that while software sales are mostly embedded within hardware sales, enterprise AI software in the data center may be headed toward a licensing model.
As per Kress, it's possible for software to be broken out as a line item when the revenue becomes meaningful.
With 2.5 million developers on CUDA already, that scale should lead to spreading of new software development kits, according to Lipacis.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>","Stung by pandemic and JBS cyberattack, U.S. ranchers build new beef plants","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. cattle ranchers and investors are sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into new beef plants after temporary closures of massive slaughterhouses at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic left farmers with nowhere to send animals destined to be turned into meat. 
A cyberattack against the U.S. unit of Brazilian meatpacking giant  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) that idled nearly a quarter of America's beef production earlier this month again highlighted vulnerabilities in the country's meat supply chain and caused more headaches for farmers.
Ranchers, as well as the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA), say the sector is too consolidated and therefore reliant on a handful of large processors and their industrial meatpacking plants. 
Four industry behemoths - JBS USA,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), Cargill Inc and National Beef Packing Company - slaughter 85% of grain-fattened cattle carved into steaks, ribs and roasts for consumers.
Smaller startup meat plants are aiming to provide local ranchers with more places to slaughter cattle, particularly those raised to produce higher-quality beef. They say adding plants can ensure some meat production continues if large facilities close.
When large meat plants close, meat supplies tighten while ranchers get stuck with cattle that would otherwise have been slaughtered. That means the price of cattle generally falls, while the price of meat in supermarkets rises. 
Extended shutdowns of some of the biggest U.S. slaughterhouses due to COVID-19 outbreaks hobbled meat production in spring 2020, leading to limits on consumers' purchases at grocery stores and a decline in frozen inventories that processors have yet to replenish.
    Rusty Kemp saw the need for more processing capacity after a 2019 fire at a Tyson Foods plant in Holcomb, Kansas, left meat buyers scrambling for supplies and cattle producers with nowhere to sell their cattle. Then, the pandemic and ransomware attack on JBS hit.
Kemp is now planning to break ground on a $300 million beef plant in Nebraska this fall. 
""We thought the Holcomb fire was an absolute train wreck and then COVID came along and Holcomb didn't seem that bad,"" he said.
Kemp's plant, named Sustainable Beef, will kill 1,500 cattle a day and use blockchain technology so consumers can track a piece of meat all the way back to the ranch, he said.
Sustainable Beef is co-owned by cattle producers who will provide animals for slaughter to the plant, instead of to major packers, Kemp said. He hired former executives of one of the biggest processors, Cargill, as consultants because of their expertise.
But Kemp said he is not trying to pick a fight with the four major processors and that bigger plants are still needed to produce large volumes of meat.
""We absolutely need more capacity and more players,"" Kemp said. 
MORE ROOM TO SLAUGHTER
Nationwide, at least five new processing facilities of varying sizes have opened or are planned following supply shocks early in the pandemic. Combined with expansions at existing plants, including one owned by JBS, daily U.S. slaughter capacity is set to increase by about 5%, according to a Reuters calculation and data from industry group the North American Meat Institute.
Market conditions are favorable for new entrants. Cattle supplies are ample, while beef prices and profit margins for packers have soared due to strong exports and demand from U.S. consumers.
In Butler, Missouri, Todd Hertzog and his family opened Hertzog Meat Company this month after considering the project for five years.
Though the $3.75 million plant is only slaughtering about 20 cattle a day, it serves nearby ranchers who want to produce higher-quality beef, said Hertzog, who manages the operation.
""The pandemic opened our eyes to the needs of local producers,"" he said.
Production disruptions during the pandemic pushed Cliff Welch to begin construction on a meat processing plant near Central City, Kentucky, at a price tag of more than $1.2 million. The cyberattack on JBS then reinforced Welch's decision to build the facility, slated to open in late 2021, he said.
Welch aims to slaughter 75 cattle a week to start, with the capability to eventually kill 300 head a week. He said he will produce custom cuts of meat using ""old-style butchery"" and plans to sell it locally.
""I'm starting from ground zero,"" Welch said. ""It's a big undertaking."" 
Welch said he received a $250,000 grant from Kentucky for the project. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department has pledged to support increased processing as part of a $4 billion initiative to strengthen the country's food system. 
""The hope would be that by spreading out, by creating diversity in size and diversity of ownership and diversity of operations, we create greater resilience,"" USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters after the JBS attack.
Missouri last year paid about $17 million in grants to meat processors with fewer than 200 employees that wanted to expand or build new facilities, state agriculture director Chris Chinn said. The payments doubled the amount of red meat inspected by the state in a program sparked by the pandemic, she said.
""It added stability to our local communities and our rural areas,"" Chinn said. ""They didn't have to depend on one local source to get their food.""
SMALLER PLANTS, SAME PROBLEMS
Small facilities are finding they face some of the same challenges as larger outfits, notably a labor shortage, without the benefit of a big corporation behind them.
After opening in March, Missouri Prime Beef Packers struggled to find workers for a plant in Pleasant Hope, Missouri, that now kills about 200 cattle a day, despite putting ads in newspapers and on radio, said Dallen Davies, director of company culture. 
The facility is slaughtering cattle raised under special guidelines, such as being grass-fed or certified for humane handling, as a way to add value for ranchers and provide a better product for consumers, Davies said. 
Plants need to differentiate themselves because they cannot compete with industry titans on volume or on low prices achieved with mass production lines. 
Former President Donald Trump last year said he urged the Justice Department to look into allegations the meatpacking industry broke antitrust law because the price that slaughterhouses pay farmers for animals dropped even as meat prices climbed. U.S. governors and lawmakers are pushing the department to keep probing.

Those involved in slaughterhouse expansion say they still need to do something to give ranchers more options in the meantime. 
""We really don't want to wait around and see if the government is going to solve this problem,"" Kemp said. ""We decided to take matters into our own hands and do this.""

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 01:12PM ET</span>",Low dosage may be behind low efficacy of CureVac vaccine -study leader,"By Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) - The low dosage might be a key reason why CureVac's COVID-19 vaccine reported disappointing efficacy in a pivotal late-stage trial, the scientist leading the study of the shot said on Thursday.
The German biotech's vaccine proved only 47% effective in an initial trial, far lower than those of rivals BioNTech/Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which are also based on mRNA technology and had efficacy rates well above 90%.
Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen which is running the trial told Reuters the low efficacy is ""very likely due to the dose"".
Unlike BioNTech and Moderna, CureVac did not modify the mRNA used in shot and therefore a higher dosage was not possible because of the side effects to be expected, Kremsner said.
With just 12 micrograms of mRNA per dose, the company has been seeking to position itself as a low-dose alternative to BioNTech and Moderna's established shots with 30 and 100 micrograms per shot, respectively.
It is also easy to store and cheaper than the other mRNA shots too. The European Union has agreed to pay 12 euro ($14.32) per dose for supplies of the shot, an EU internal document shows, but has paid more than 15 euros for the other mRNA shots. However, the interim trial analysis goes some way to challenging the expectation, which was previously reflected in the company's share price, that all mRNA vaccines are similar. The news wiped as much as 52% off the company's value on Thursday.
CureVac said on Wednesday that new variants had proved a headwind, but data from BioNTech and Moderna have, however, so far suggested only somewhat weaker protection against new variants.
Kremsner said he thought it was probably a ""long shot"" as to whether CureVac's vaccine might turn out to be more effective when targeting a particular variant.

The disappointing results are a blow since European governments had been hoping to add it to their arsenal after age limits were imposed on the use of the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines due to a link to extremely rare but potentially fatal clotting disorder.

LONDON (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase has bought British digital wealth manager Nutmeg as part of the U.S. bank's expansion into the UK retail banking and investment market. 
The U.S. bank is looking to take on established British retail banking rivals and a growing band of fintechs with plans to become a full-service retail bank under its Chase brand. It will compete with Goldman Sach's consumer brand Marcus, which launched in Britain in 2018.
Nutmeg - which has more than 140,000 clients and more than 3.5 billion pounds ($4.89 billion) in assets under management - will form the basis of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)'s retail digital wealth management offering internationally, Nutmeg said in a statement.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a source close to the transaction said it valued Nutmeg at close to 700 million pounds ($972.79 million).
Launched in 2012, Nutmeg aimed to upend the traditional wealth management market by offering lower cost automated financial planning services. 
While it quickly became one of Britain's best known financial technology companies and robo-advisers, it has yet to turn a profit. In its most recent set of full accounts for 2019, the group made a pretax loss of 22 million pounds.
JPMorgan confirmed the acquisition and said it would complement the group's UK digital bank launch under its Chase brand later this year.
""We are building Chase in the UK from scratch using the very latest technology and putting the customer's experience at the heart of our offering, principles that Nutmeg shares with us,"" said Sanoke Viswanathan, CEO of international consumer at JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan had already launched a product partnership with Nutmeg in November.
The Nutmeg deal follows plans by rival U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) group Inc to shift the focus of its Marcus consumer division in Britain towards wealth and investments. The bank told Reuters last month that it intended to offer a robo-adviser to Marcus clients in the country by the first quarter of next year.
Banking industry experts said that while Nutmeg's customer base is small relative to those of major banks, it will give JPMorgan an initial user base in Britain, where it does not yet have a consumer presence. 

""I don't think this is a major spend and it gives them a quick leg up in the marketplace in the UK,"" said Chris Skinner, CEO of financial technology research firm The Finanser.

Aduhelm was approved based on evidence that it can reduce brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's, rather than proof that it slows progression of the fatal mind-wasting disease.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug - despite the strong objection of its own expert advisory panel - for all patients with Alzheimer's, although Aduhelm has only been tested for patients in the early stages of the disease.
""Hopefully clinicians will follow the clinical trial guidelines, because we really don't have any evidence for more advanced patients with Alzheimer's,"" Salloway said. 
Some doctors are wary even of prescribing Aduhelm for that group.
Dr. David Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota was one of three experts who resigned from the panel of advisors which had recommended that the FDA not approve Biogen's drug.
Between questionable trial results and potential side effects, Knopman did not see reason for most patients to get the medicine. He said he is walking a line between being paternalistic and honest about his concerns to patients as Mayo prepares to treat them with the new drug.
""I may have talked one person out of"" using it, he said. ""I will turn over some of the responsibility to this team of people we are putting together. They will get my opinion.""
Biogen has estimated around 1.5 million of the 6 million people in the United States with Alzheimer's would be considered to have early-stage disease.
 Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) Chief Clinical Officer Steve Miller said he expects Cigna, as well as other health insurers and Medicare, will only agree to cover the drug for patients with early Alzheimer's.
Biogen, which is partnered on the drug with Japanese drugmaker Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd, has set an average price of $56,000 a year, which the Alzheimer's Association - a longtime outspoken supporter of Biogen - called ""simply unacceptable.""
The vast majority of patients will be covered by the federal Medicare health program. But Robert Egge, chief public policy officer at the Alzheimer's Association, said most Medicare recipients are responsible for 20% of the cost of drugs given by doctors, and about 10% of them have no cap on those costs.
""This could further exacerbate health equity challenges that we have across the country,"" he said.
Biogen said it hoped the ""value-based contract"" it agreed to with Cigna last week that will track the drug's effectiveness was a step toward ""efficient and affordable patient access."" It added that patients with Medicare fee-for-service were presumed to be automatically covered.
Salloway said Butler Hospital would ask Medicare to cover the costs of Archambault's treatment. ""I am very happy to have this,"" the patient said in a webcast news conference.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it will have more information on coverage soon.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an influential drug pricing research group, has said trial data for Aduhelm, known chemically as aducanumab, indicate a cost-effective price of no more than $8,300 per year. Looking only at favorable trial results - one of two pivotal aducanumab trials failed - that price rises as high as $23,100, ICER said.

After discounts, Biogen's net price for Aduhelm is likely to be around $30,000 per year, Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson said in a research note. In addition to those costs, patients must have tests to diagnose Alzheimer's such as a brain scan, which is not covered by Medicare, or tests using spinal fluid.
Still, given that this is the first approved drug that might slow the lethal, memory-robbing condition, hospitals are gearing up. ""All the major centers that have an interest in Alzheimer's disease are taking this seriously,"" Salloway said.

(Reuters) -Kroger Co raised its forecast for annual profit on Thursday, betting that its quick pickup and delivery services will encourage Americans to order groceries online even as they dine out again.
The company's focus on private labels, use of robots to more quickly stock and dispatch goods through a partnership with Ocado (LON:OCDO) and tie-ups with third parties for deliveries are expected to help Kroger (NYSE:KR) sustain a rapid online sales growth seen since 2019. 
First-quarter digital sales jumped 16% at Kroger, even as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and big-box rivals Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) doubled down on grocery.
""The customers continue to like to shop online ... When they shop (online and in stores), our retention rate is incredibly high,"" Chief Executive Officer William McMullen said on a post-earnings call.
Kroger forecast 2021 adjusted profit per share between $2.95 and $3.10, compared with its prior range of $2.75 to $2.95. It expects 2021 adjusted same-store sales to fall up to 4%, while it had earlier projected a decline of up to 5%.
""We do not believe most investors expected a print this strong, nor a guidance raise this substantial,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Shares of Kroger, which unveiled a $1 billion buyback program, jumped 3%. They have gained about 23% this year, compared to a 12% gain for the broader S&P 500 index
The company expects at-home food consumption to soften as reopenings gather pace, even as customers shop more frequently after a year of consolidated trips.

First-quarter revenue came in above pre-pandemic levels at $41.3 billion, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of $39.78 billion.
Strong performance in its alternative profit business, which includes media and personal finance divisions, helped Kroger earn $1.19 per share, above estimates of $1.01.

Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN),  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX), and Covestro (COVTY) are examples of names that possess solid growth attributes and are trading at valuations that are lower than their peers. So, we think it could be wise to scoop up their shares before their prices rise to justified levels. Read on.Even though investors rotated away from expensive growth stocks earlier this year, the solid economic recovery has been driving a renewed and increasing focus by investors on growth stocks given their ability to grow faster, capitalizing on supportive economic policies. The revival of investor interest in growth stocks is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) and Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares’ (VUG) 3.4% and 4% gains, respectively, over the past month. This compares to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.3% returns over the same period.
The United States’ gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% annual rate in the first quarter of 2021. And according to The Conference Board, the U.S.’ real GDP is expected to rise 9% in the second quarter of 2021. Furthermore, even though the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said on June 16 that at least two interest rate hikes are expected in 2023, interest rates have been left at near-zero for now.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on stocks that are still out of favor but possess solid growth attributes. We think Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN), POSCO (PKX), and Covestro AG (COVTY) fit the bill. They are currently trading at discounts to their peers but hold immense growth potential.

But the company has been burning cash at a rapid pace and is still unprofitable. Furthermore, its weak financials don’t justify its lofty valuation. So, we think the stock could retreat further. Read on.Based in Toronto, Canada, Cronos Group Inc. (CRON) is a cannabinoid company that manufactures and markets hemp-derived supplements and cosmetic products under the Lord Jones and Happy Dance brands in the United States. CRON’s stock has gained 28.1% over the past year due to its expanded distribution network and strategic investments. However, over the past three months, it the stock has declined 15.5%. This can be attributed primarily to the loss reported by the company for the first quarter of 2021.The stock is currently trading at $8.61, which is 45.5% below its 52-week high of $15.8.
While hopes for a federal level legalization of cannabis remain strong, it is highly unlikely that such a bill will be passed this year. This being the case could limit CRON’s growth.
Also, the marijuana sector has become crowded of late with new operators that are trying to grab market share from their peers. Amid this scenario, CRON is trading at a high valuation despite being unprofitable. So, we expect the stock to decline further in the near term.

(Reuters) -European shares ended a touch lower on Thursday as hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve raised concerns over early policy tightening, with mining stocks falling the most as commodity prices tumbled. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1% at 459.33, snapping a nine-day gaining streak, after the Fed said it could begin raising interest rates a year earlier than expected.
Mining stocks were the worst performers, sinking 2.5% as the U.S. central bank's comments lifted the dollar and dented commodity prices. Utility and chemical shares were also among the biggest decliners. 
Losses in major mining stocks saw the FTSE 100 shed 0.4%. 
Bank stocks were among the best performers for the day, adding 0.4% as bond yields rose on the Fed. But losses in major Spanish lenders, on the heels of an antitrust probe, pushed the sector off intraday highs. 
Euro zone inflation rose as expected in May, data showed on Thursday, driven by a sharp spike in energy prices and more expensive services.
While the figure was a shade above the European Central Bank's target, the ECB has struck a different tone on policy than the Fed.
The ECB said last week that it was too early to debate closing the money taps despite a recent rise in inflation. 
""While central banks may seem fairly relaxed about the inflation outlook, they still have to look a lot further out, and if the economy improves as expected, monetary policy will have to change,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
""The fact that the Fed is slowly preparing the ground now may be unsettling for markets, but it is also necessary, and in the here and now, monetary policy still hasn't changed that much.""
European shares have rallied to record highs on dovish signals from the ECB, with optimism over an economic recovery this year also supporting sentiment.

As a result, we think two prominent players in the industry, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Oracle (ORCL), should benefit. But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Twilio Inc. (TWLO) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are two prominent players in the growing cloud computing industry. TWLO offers a cloud communications platform that enables developers to build, scale and operate real-time communications within software applications. ORCL provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments. Its Oracle cloud software-as-a-service offering includes various cloud software applications.
The cloud computing industry, which got a significant boost last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic-driven surge in work-from-home structures, has been growing consistently with increasing use of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Because businesses are expected to partly continue with remote working for the foreseeable future, there should be steady demand for cloud solutions going forward. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of cloud solutions as part of an ongoing digital transformation by businesses should keep driving the industry’s growth. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 17.9% CAGR over the next seven years. So, both TWLO and ORCL should witness increasing demand for their solutions.
But while TWLO has returned 59.5% over the past year, ORCL has gained 41.2%. Furthermore, in terms of their past nine months’ performance, TWLO is a clear winner with 46.2% returns versus ORCL’s 27.6%. So, which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

Major companies are under increasing pressure from investors and climate change activists to report the emissions that result when customers use their products.
Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East said that made decarbonising a particularly ""challenging task"" for the company given the current use of fossil fuels in its products and the increasing demand for power globally. 
But he said it was also a commercial opportunity as Rolls-Royce outlined plans for all its new products to be compatible with net zero targets by 2030, en route to achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. 
To ensure it reaches that target, the company said it will lift its research and development spending on low carbon and net zero technologies to 75% of its total budget by 2025 from about 50% now. 
The company spends over 1 billion pounds annually on R&D, although that fell in 2020 from 2019 as the pandemic strained Rolls-Royce's finances. East said that figure would grow as aviation recovered. 
In the aviation sector, its biggest business, Rolls-Royce plans to make all its commercial engines compatible to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which produces up to 70% less carbon than conventional fuel, by 2023.
The challenge for SAFs is that there is a shortage of supply. East said for that help was needed.
""We see a huge role for governments here in terms of policy,"" East told a media call on Thursday. 
In the longer term, Rolls-Royce is also working on less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen options.

""We're in the process of discussing hydrogen with Airbus now,"" said Chief Technology Officer Paul Stein. 
By the mid-2030s, he said the company could also look to use its small modular reactors to produce an e-fuel, which could eventually replace sustainable aviation fuel.

Total company sales were $41.3 billion in the first quarter, compared to $41.5 billion for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came at $1.19 against $1.22 in the first quarter of last fiscal.
Both sales and EPS, while lower than comparable figures last fiscal, were higher than the estimate.

At an Automotive Press Association event in Detroit on Tuesday, Lordstown President Rich Schmidt had said, ""currently, we have enough orders for production for '21 and '22'... Those are firm orders we have for those two years.""
However, in a filing with the U.S. securities regulator on Thursday, the company said, ""although these vehicle purchase agreements provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance, these agreements do not represent binding purchase orders or other firm purchase commitments.""

On Monday, just days after the company said it may not have enough money to stay in business over the next year, Chief Executive Officer Steve Burns and Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez resigned. 
The resignations followed the company's reports of conclusions from an internal investigation into claims made by short-seller Hindenburg. Hindenburg, which took a short position on Lordstown shares in March, alleged that the company had misled consumers and investors.

The electric vehicle charging network is launching a collaboration with the German brand called Mercedes me Charge, to be launched with the new EQS all-electric luxury sedan and available in all EQ future mobility products from Mercedes-EQ.
The collaboration allows for access to EV charging from ChargePoint and other networks.
ChargePoint offers multiple charging network operators so drivers don't have to have multiple charging network accounts, subscriptions or charging cards. Drivers with a Mercedes me Charge account will have access to nearly 60,000 public places to charge on both ChargePoint and other EV charging networks, as well as more than 60,000 additional semi-public places to charge on the ChargePoint network, such as those located at workplaces, shopping malls, hotels, and multifamily residences.
Drivers will have the option to use Plug & Charge on DC stations on the ChargePoint network and others.   
ChargePoint’s growing network offers drivers the choice to charge using level 2 or DC fast charging.   
ChargePoint is still a money-losing operation with revenue of about $40 million in the most recent quarter. The company went public earlier this year via a special purpose acquisition company.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>","After EU, Britain and U.S. reach truce in aircraft trade dispute","By Alistair Smout and Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain and the United States agreed on Thursday to resolve a long-running trade dispute over aid for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) and focus on tackling Chinese subsidies, echoing a five-year tariff truce announced by Washington and Brussels.
Together, the matching deals draw a line under 17 years of battles at the World Trade Organization and establish a common front against ""non-market"" funding in a reference to China's nascent aerospace industry.
The dispute had triggered a months-long transatlantic tariff war hitting industries such as Scotch whisky until a temporary tariff ceasefire was called this year to ease negotiations.
Tariffs will be suspended for a further five years while governments also pledge to provide any funding on market terms, lifting a perennial source of transatlantic tensions.
""This will support jobs across the United Kingdom and is great news for Scotch whisky and other exports including aerospace who will no longer face punitive tariffs,"" British trade minister Liz Truss said on Twitter. 
The Scotch Whisky Association said its members had lost 600 million pounds ($836.64 million) because of tariffs. In the United States, the Distilled Spirits Council said American whiskey was still being hurt by tariffs in a separate dispute on steel and aluminium. 
The UK-U.S. aerospace deal came two days after the EU reached a truce with Washington over aircraft subsidies, and capped a week of summit diplomacy aimed at countering the rising influence of China.
United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai called it ""a model we can build on to ensure fair competition and address common challenges from China and other non-market economies"".
AIRBUS JOBS
The United States and Europe had been battling since 2004 over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, in the largest ever corporate trade dispute. 
Britain has since left the European Union and Thursday's almost identically worded agreement achieves many of the same results as the EU-U.S. deal.
Britain, whose ability to negotiate trade deals independently of the EU is central to its new ""global Britain"" stance, has a long history as one of four core nations involved in Airbus, a relationship that predated its EU membership, and its UK factories make the wings for Airbus commercial jets. 
In December, Britain and the United States came close to a standalone aerospace deal that could have forced the hand of Brussels in its own talks with Washington, but drew back over concerns over UK jobs, Reuters reported..
An official familiar with the talks said it had not been possible at that time to reach a balanced deal.
Airbus, which has 14,000 staff in Britain, has repeatedly warned that it could shift work abroad, restricting Britain's ability to negotiate independently over aerospace.
The more limited truce agreed this week leaves a system of government loans for Airbus intact on paper, but commits Britain, France, Germany and Spain to issue any new loans for Airbus development on market terms still to be defined.
Both sides had won partial victories and claimed to have complied with thousands of pages of rulings, but this week's deals set aside years of legal bickering at the WTO, which ruled past Airbus loans were illegal while rapping support for Boeing.

Separately, Britain is keen to agree a free trade agreement with the United States, as it seeks new relationships around the world following its exit from the European Union in 2020.

Investing.com – Ford (NYSE:F) shares were flat in Thursday’s trading after the automaker said its second quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes will exceed its own expectations and be slightly better than a year ago.
The company had reported a negative $1.9 billion in adjusted EBIT in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Ford will disclose its performance for the ongoing quarter on July 28.
Company President and CEO Jim Farley is participating this afternoon in Deutsche Bank’s Global Auto Industry Conference, and the company issued this statement ahead of that.
Net income for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be substantially lower than a year ago, when results included a $3.5 billion gain on Ford’s investment in Argo AI.
Farley will tell conference attendees that Ford is seeing improvement in its automotive business since providing full-year operating guidance on April 28, even as uncertainty about supplies of semiconductors lingers, a company note said.
The improvement in automotive is being driven by lower-than-anticipated costs and favorable market factors. Additionally, higher vehicle auction values are benefitting Ford Credit.
The carmaker anticipates full-year 2021 adjusted EBIT to be between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion, including an adverse effect of about $2.5 billion from the semiconductor issue.

Buy These 3 Safer Industrial Stocks Instead,"While the meme-stock mania has been fascinating, we think it is high time to focus on stocks that possess solid financial credentials and are not gaining based solely on social media hype and speculation. As such, investors should divert their attention to industrial stocks Deere & Company, (NYSE:DE), Illinois Tool Works (FL), and ABB (ABB) as examples. These companies are well positioned to benefit from President Biden’s proposed infrastructure spending plan. And, since they have maintained healthy balance sheets and possess sound fundamentals, we believe they are much safer bets than volatile meme stocks. Let’s discuss.Although the stupefying gains by meme stocks this year have been fascinating, they don't make sense from a fundamental standpoint. Meme stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry Limited. (NYSE:BB) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) have been dominating headlines for some time now due to an explosive surge in their prices spurred by retail trading commentary on subreddit r/wallstreetbets.
And although it might be tempting to jump on the meme-stock bandwagon to capitalize on the trend, betting on them can be extremely risky. That’s because for most meme stocks' weak fundamentals and financials do not justify their current price levels. Hence, ignoring the hype, we think it is safer and better to invest in stocks that are fundamentally sound.
As U.S. manufacturing and construction activities gradually return to their pre-pandemic levels, betting on industrial stocks Deere & Company (DE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and ABB Ltd (ABB) could be safe and rewarding. Furthermore, the Biden administration’s proposed infrastructure plan could provide a shot in the arm to these companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The once high-flying California lawyer Michael Avenatti deserves a ""very substantial"" prison sentence for trying to extort millions of dollars from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), U.S. prosecutors told a judge.
The Wednesday night recommendation came one week after Avenatti's lawyers said their client should spend no more than six months behind bars plus one year of home confinement.
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe is scheduled to sentence Avenatti on June 30 in Manhattan.
Probation officers recommend eight years in prison for Avenatti, and prosecutors said federal guidelines recommend more than 11 years.
Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.
Avenatti, 50, became famous in 2018 when he represented adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
He was convicted of threatening to publicly accuse Nike of secretly paying families of college basketball prospects unless it paid him and another lawyer up to $25 million for a probe and his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, $1.5 million.
Jurors also convicted Avenatti of defrauding Franklin by not telling him he wouldn't settle without a probe.
Avenatti ""betrayed his client and sought to enrich himself by weaponizing his public profile,"" prosecutors said. ""This was an egregious abuse of trust.""
In letters to Gardephe, Nike maintained that Avenatti's accusations were false, while Franklin said Avenatti's actions ""destroyed my reputation in my community.""
Avenatti's lawyers have said their client has suffered enough during his ""epic fall and public shaming,"" including three months in a Manhattan jail and ridicule by Trump and the former president's media supporters.
They also said a recurrence was impossible because Avenatti would never again practice law.
Avenatti was convicted in February 2020.

He still faces two trials in California on charges he stole millions of dollars from clients and committed tax and bank fraud, and another trial in Manhattan for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of money from a book contract.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Read more to find out.Mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) finances the purchase of residential and commercial real estate assets. The housing industry boom over the past year, coupled with increased investor attention on high-yield dividend stocks amid a volatile market, helped NLY’s share price to surge 32.2% over the past year, and 10.3% year-to-date.
However, current contradictory macroeconomic trends make NLY’s growth potential uncertain in the near term. While the Fed’s recent recommitment to hold the interest rates at near zero levels in the near term makes NLY a coveted stock due to its relatively higher dividend yields, rising commodity costs could continue to pressure the housing market.
Also, rising construction prices have caused homebuilder sentiment to slump to a 10-month low, driving a slump in the industry. Consequently, analysts expect NLY’s revenues and earnings to decline because the demand for loan assets and asset-backed securities are expected to fall.

LONDON (Reuters) -Irish airline Ryanair is launching a legal challenge against Britain over its ""traffic light"" system for international travel, hoping to force a relaxation of strict rules that threaten the summer holiday season. 
The airline has teamed up with Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and the pair filed legal papers at England's High Court on Thursday to seek clarity over the transparency of the system, a MAG spokesperson said. 
Other airlines are expected to join the legal action.
With just weeks before the peak July and August travel season when most profits are made, the aviation industry is worried about losing another summer to COVID-19 as the British government blocks most travel, meaning more job losses and financial strain. 
The industry has repeatedly criticised the government's traffic light system for international destinations, saying it is unpredictable and doesn't make scientific sense. It says some low risk countries and islands should be open for travel.
A government spokesperson said it cannot comment on legal proceedings.
""We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out,"" the government said in a statement. 
Britain allowed vacations again from May after months of lockdown but discourages travel to popular holiday destinations such as Spain, France, Greece and the United States, classifying them as ""amber"" under its traffic light system. 
This means travellers must quarantine for 10 days on their return and take multiple COVID-19 tests. Only a handful of places are classified as green, and none in the European Union after Portugal was removed at short notice earlier in June. 
The court papers will argue the British government should clearly explain how it makes decisions on categorising countries, given the ""dramatic"" impact these decisions have on the aviation industry. 

""The current opaque way that decisions are being made is undermining consumer confidence to book summer holidays and makes it impossible for airports, airlines and other travel companies to plan for the recovery of international travel,"" the companies said in a statement to Reuters.
The aviation industry had been counting on Britons to be at the forefront of the resumption in travel, given the country has one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world.

Investing.com -- Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) shares looked set for another rough day in the markets on Thursday after the company disclosed it has no binding purchase orders from customers.
The shares plunged more than 7% amid an unending flow of negative news from the company.
The company was forced to issue a clarification to the SEC after President Rich Schmidt told journalists Tuesday, “Currently, we have enough orders for production for '21 and '22"".
Schmidt was speaking at an Automotive Press Association online media event.
""Those are firm orders we have for those two years,"" he said, according to a Reuters report on Tuesday.  
The company clarified that it has signed purchase agreements and “. . .although these vehicle purchase agreements provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance, these agreements do not represent binding purchase orders or other firm purchase commitments”.
The beleaguered company recently appointed a new CEO and a CFO.
Last week, the company warned investors it was close to running out of cash and may go out of business next year.
It said it did not have enough funding to start full commercial production of its planned electric pick-up truck in September and warned there is now ""substantial doubt"" about its ability to stay in business over the next 12 months.
R.F. Lafferty analyst Jaime Perez has a ‘sell’ rating on Lordstown with a target of $3, 72% lower from its Wednesday’s close of $10.78.

(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud on Thursday said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip, a move likely to intensify AMD's push to grab market share from rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Cloud computing providers such as Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the biggest buyers of data center chips. They build services on top of the chips to rent the computing power out to millions of customers.
Google said on Thursday it will start offering services based on AMD's ""Milan"" server chip, which AMD released in March. Google said customers such as  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) are testing the new AMD-based services.

AMD has been gaining market share against Intel, which was long the dominant player in data center chips but whose offerings have inferior performance on some measures because of years of stumbles in Intel's manufacturing operations.
Intel in April announced its ""Ice Lake"" chip competitor to AMD's ""Milan"" chip and said all major cloud providers would support it, but Intel has not said when Google will start offering services based on its latest chip.

More than 70,000 of the firm’s employees have voluntarily disclosed their vaccine status to the bank, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. The firm, which has more than 210,000 employees globally, has already invited those who have received their shots to begin returning.
“Right now we’re moving people back who are vaccinated,” Moynihan said. “We’re concentrating on getting them back to work because that allows people to move about under the CDC guidelines without masks and thing like that.”
Bank of America and its rivals have begun unveiling plans in recent weeks to return thousands of workers to towers in New York and elsewhere in coming months as vaccines abound across the U.S.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). asked its New York staff to begin returning this week, marking the most ambitious plan among major Wall Street firms.
“After Labor Day, our view is all the vaccinated teammates will be back and we’ll be able to operate fairly normally, and we’ll then start to make provisions for the other teammates as we move through the fall,” Moynihan said of the Sept. 6 holiday.
Inflation Expectations
In the wide-ranging interview, Moynihan also said it’s still unclear whether signs of a pickup in inflation are temporary.
“You will see the employment market tighten,” he said. “Loan demand we are seeing start to pick up as we move through the months of April, May and June, which is better than it was last fall or coming into the early spring.”
About 70% of the money consumers received from stimulus measures has yet to be spent, another factor in whether inflation will continue to rise, according to Moynihan. The bank’s small-business customers are struggling to find workers, and wage growth is getting “stickier,” he said, adding that customers’ spending is up 20% from pre-pandemic levels.
The firm is beginning to see a pickup in its credit-card business, with originations now down only about 30% -- an improvement from the 70% slump it experienced during the depths of the pandemic. Consumers’ spending at restaurants and on travel has increased dramatically, he said, though the firm is still seeing tepid demand from customers actually borrowing on their cards.
On the outlook for Bank of America’s trading business, Moynihan said the company’s results are “not going to be a heck of a lot different” from competitors, which in recent days have projected big declines from the pandemic-induced surge last year.

Although the trade dispute had focussed on a 17-year tussle over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and European rival Airbus, the drinks industry got caught up in it when former U.S. President Donald Trump slapped 25% tariffs on Scotch whisky in 2019.
Those tariffs - which had already been suspended earlier in the year - now end for at least five years as a result of the deal struck by Britain and the United States.
""This is very good news for Scotch Whisky. The past two years have been extremely damaging for our industry,"" said Karen Bett, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, adding that the industry had lost over 600 million pounds ($840 million) in exports as a result of the 25% tariff.
""This deal removes the threat of tariffs being reimposed on Scotch Whisky next month and enables distillers to focus on recovering exports to our largest and most valuable export market.""
Noting the truce had not fully resolved the underlying dispute, she urged the governments to keep on working constructively.
The deal also helps U.S. exporters of rum, brandy and vodka, which will see 25% tariffs of their own products also lifted.
But exports of bourbon and other American whiskeys to Britain and the European Union are still subject to tariffs imposed in retaliation over a separate dispute about steel and aluminium.
""This puts American Whiskeys at a serious competitive disadvantage in the UK and the EU, our two most important export markets,"" said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council. 

""We hope this positive momentum will also lead to the prompt and permanent removal of the EU and UK’s tariffs on American Whiskeys.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's biggest shareholder Effissimo Capital Management described the conglomerate's board as ""ineffective"" in a statement on Thursday, and said it had failed to resolve governance and compliance shortcomings at the company. 
The statement marks the first time that Singapore-based Effissimo has made its views known since a shareholder-commissioned investigation revealed Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) colluded with the Japanese government to block foreign shareholders from having influence.
Effissimo, which holds about 10% of Toshiba's shares, said the board's decision to remove only two board director nominees in response to the investigation was a reminder that it was unwilling to hold the board members accountable.
Toshiba was not immediately available for comment.
Shareholder advisory groups Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis continue to recommend that shareholders should vote against the re-appointment of Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama and certain other current directors.
3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's second-largest shareholder, has also called for the resignation of Nagayama.

Effissimo's statement, first reported by the Financial Times, did not call for a resignation of specific directors, but said it would ""continue to hold the board members accountable when necessary.""
The independent investigation last week alleged that the company's management colluded with Japan's trade ministry to prevent foreign investors from gaining board influence, in what 3D Investment called the world's worst corporate scandal in a decade.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's biggest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has appointed five more investment banks to work as book runners on its U.S initial public offering (IPO) worth up to $10 billion, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The shares had fallen 3.4% Wednesday.
A near 30% jump in operating expenses from the year-ago quarter overshadowed the 12% revenue growth and hit the bottom line. A higher marketing spend that rose 54% drove the operating expenses.
The company reported a net loss of $4.48 million in its first earnings announcement after going public. This was against a net income of $559,000 in the same quarter a year ago.
Revenue of $81.03 million was higher than the expected $79.25 million. It was also higher than last time’s $72.37 million.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's market regulator has begun an antitrust probe into Didi Chuxing, three people with knowledge of the matter said, just as the ride-hailing giant is pushing ahead with what could be the largest initial public offering in the United States this year.
The probe, reported here for the first time, is the latest in a sweeping crackdown on China's so-called ""platform"" companies, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), is investigating whether Didi used any competitive practices that squeezed out smaller rivals unfairly, two of the three sources said. 
The regulator is also examining whether the pricing mechanism used by Didi's core ride-hailing business is transparent enough, the three sources said.
""We do not comment on unsubstantiated speculation from unnamed source(s),"" Didi said in an emailed statement. SAMR did not respond to requests for comment.
In its IPO prospectus made public last week, Didi disclosed that it and more than 30 other Chinese internet companies had met with regulators, including the SAMR, in April. The regulators asked the companies to conduct a ""self-inspection"" and submit compliance commitments, it said.
The companies were asked to identify and correct possible violations of antimonopoly, anti-unfair competition, tax and other related laws and regulations, Didi said in the filing.
Didi said it had completed the self-inspection and the ""relevant governmental authorities have conducted onsite inspections"". 
It warned that regulatory bodies might not be satisfied with the inspection results and the firm may be subject to potential penalties. 
Two of the sources familiar with the situation said that the probe by the markets regulator was in the initial stages, and that the regulator was yet to give the company detailed instructions.
The impact of the probe on the company's IPO, expected to be the biggest Chinese IPO in New York since Alibaba's $25 billion float in 2014, remains to be seen. 
One of the sources said Didi believed pricing and unfair competition would be viewed as relatively minor offences, which had given the company enough confidence to move ahead with plans for the IPO. 
ANTITRUST CRACKDOWN 
Didi is also highlighting its creation of jobs to regulators, a key factor that could merit a more lenient attitude from Beijing, the source said. 
The company now employs about 13 million annual active drivers in China, according to its prospectus.
In recent months China has sought to curb the economic and social power of its once loosely regulated internet giants, a clampdown backed by President Xi Jinping. In April, SAMR imposed a $2.75 billion fine on Alibaba, a record for the agency.
In March, SAMR fined the registered firm behind Didi's community group-buying platform Chengxin Youxuan 1.5 million yuan ($233,656) along with another four firms, citing ""improper pricing behaviour"".
Didi, the world's largest mobility-technology platform, operates in 15 countries and counts over 493 million annual active users globally, according to its prospectus. 
It reached its dominant position in the online ride-hailing business in China after years-long subsidy wars with Alibaba-backed Kuaidi and Silicon Valley-based Uber's China unit, both of which were merged into Didi as investors grew tired of burning cash and demanded profits.
In 2016, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc sold its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the Chinese firm, which also made a $1 billion investment in Uber. 
The U.S. firm currently owns 12.8% stake in Didi, according to the Chinese company's prospectus. Some of Asia's largest technology investment firms, including SoftBank Group Corp, Alibaba and Tencent, have also invested in Didi.

In addition to ride-sharing, Didi operates different businesses around mobility, including electric vehicle charging networks, fleet management, car making and autonomous driving.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) expects Poland's Supreme Court to rule in August or September on contested Swiss franc loans, its finance chief said, as the bank prepares for heavy writedowns at its Polish mBank subsidiary in the wake of the decision. 
Once the hit from the ruling is digested, Commerzbank could relaunch a sale of the unit, people close to the matter said. An auction petered out last year after buyers flagged concerns about the possible fallout from the Swiss franc mortgages issue. 
""mBank is an important part of our strategy and we expect it to continue to contribute to the success of the Group with increasing earnings in the future"", Commerzbank said. 
mBank had no immediate comment.
The Supreme Court is expected to lay out how local courts should treat lawsuits against Polish banks over mortgages customers took out in Swiss francs more than a decade ago to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates, only to face far higher costs when the value of the Polish zloty slumped.
While Commerzbank's supervisory board this week discussed mBank's future, no decision has been taken and bank will wait for the final ruling before taking any further steps, people close to the matter said. 
But potential bidders and their advisers are already revisiting mBank in anticipation of a new auction as early as the autumn, other people close to the situation said, adding clarity on the Swiss franc fallout would give them comfort in defining a valuation for Poland's fifth-largest bank by assets.
Commerzbank Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp said at an industry conference on Thursday that after two promising rulings Polish bankers were now more optimistic than a few weeks ago regarding the court ruling. 
mBank may, however, still face a hit of about 1 billion euros from the ruling, people close to the matter said, adding this was only a rough estimate. Commerzbank has so far set aside 300 million euros in provisions for the case. 
mBank's sale was once considered a cornerstone of Commerzbank's turnaround plans. As Germany's second-largest listed lender continues to restructure, it would reap proceeds from a sale, but would also be giving up reliable cash cow. 
Commerzbank is also worried the sale price could be depressed by political interference as Poland's leaders have said they want more of the country's lenders in domestic hands. 
Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has tightened control over the banking sector and several bidders withdrew from the mBank auction last year confidentially citing political concerns.
At the time, a consortium led by PZU and Pekao bid for mBank, while PKO and Erste initially expressed an interest. The banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
mBank's has a market capitalisation of about 12.9 billion zlotys ($3.4 billion). Commerzbank owns a 69% stake.

LONDON (Reuters) -Pan-European financial markets operator Euronext said on Thursday that it had resolved the technical glitches which knocked out index derivatives trading for nearly four hours earlier in the day.
Euronext, which runs the Paris, Milan and Amsterdam stock markets among others, said earlier index derivatives contracts had been suspended, although trading in other areas was not affected and proceeding as normal.
The latest glitch in index derivatives - which allow holders to buy contracts at pre-determined prices - comes at a sensitive time for the market operator, which controls nearly a quarter of the equity trading flow in Europe after its successful acquisition of Borsa Italiana last year.
It is the second such outage this year, on top of a more widespread stoppage in October 2020 when a disruption to derivatives and cash trading from Dublin to Paris forced traders to sit on the sidelines for hours.
Euronext said the cause of the outage, which began shortly before 0700 GMT, had been resolved and trading and the post-trade process on other segments was taking place as normal. It did not elaborate on the cause of the disruption.
When outages hit U.S. markets, investors can seamlessly migrate their trading onto other exchanges, but Europe does not have any back-up system in place and the issue has become more urgent as exchanges across Europe have embarked on a consolidation spree. Euronext operates six major stock markets in the region.
While trading of stocks can also be done on other platforms such as Cboe Europe, Aquis and Turquoise, traders generally use Euronext as the reference market.
Unlike cash trading, which was largely unaffected by the disruption on Thursday, outages are slightly different in the derivatives market where there is less competition among trading venues. 
Usually derivative contracts are traded on a single exchange but increasingly other operators are also vying for a piece of the pie. Cboe Europe, the largest alternative venue operator on the continent, plans to launch a European equity derivatives exchange in September.

Cboe declined to comment. 
In a paper published in May, Cboe Europe and Aquis Exchange proposed an industry-wide plan to respond to primary cash market outages, which would see them handle much of the process following a glitch.

(Reuters) - Global securities index publisher MSCI is looking at launching indexes for cryptocurrency assets, according to Chief Executive Henry Fernandez, in what would be another step towards mainstream acceptance for digital currencies and the companies trading in them.
Fernandez, speaking at a Clubhouse event organized by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz earlier this week, said MSCI has been talking to experts and is aiming to launch crypto indexes.
He gave no details on what assets any index would focus on nor any timeline for their introduction and MSCI later declined a Reuters request to elaborate on his comments. 
Companies including Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have taken small steps towards supporting cryptocurrencies but they are still little used in day-to-day life.
In May, the S&P Dow Jones Indices unveiled new cryptocurrency indexes, bringing bitcoin and ethereum to the trading floors of Wall Street. The new indexes, S&P Bitcoin Index, S&P Ethereum Index and S&P Crypto Mega Cap Index, will measure the performance of digital assets tied to them.
Crypto exchange Coinbase Global, of which Andreessen Horowitz is the biggest shareholder, also successfully listed on the tech-heavy NASDAQ in April, as bitcoin hit a record peak. 
MSCI has been looking to expand its offerings, with Fernandez saying on Clubhouse the areas of private credit and environmental, social and governance (ESG) held opportunities for the company. 
In April, the company launched 20 thematic indexes to help investors bet on ""megatrends"" in China that are aligned with the Chinese government's policy goals.

The company publishes popular indexes for global equities and other securities, used by asset managers and investors to guide the allocation of $14.5 trillion in assets globally as of the end of 2020. 
Inclusion in its indexes tends to open the door to more funds investing in the asset in question.

In May, Zhang unexpectedly announced that he will step down as CEO of the TikTok owner amid Chinese' regulators' tightened scrutiny of the country's biggest technology firms. He said at the time he would complete the transition work with his successor Liang Rubo by the end of this year.
Zhang told staff he was currently studying other companies' organizational structures and managing styles, and doing research on the education industry. Zhang remains chairman of ByteDance and has the absolute voting power at the company. 
The company told staff at the same meeting that its total revenue more than doubled in 2020 to $34.3 billion and its operating loss was $2 billion, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The loss was partly attributable to accounting norms for share-based compensation of employees, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Reuters has reported that ByteDance, one of the world's biggest private tech companies with an estimated value of about $300 billion in recent trades, had a revenue goal of around $30 billion for 2020. 
ByteDance posted a widening net loss of $45 billion and a gross profit of $19 billion, representing 93% growth year-over-year, the company told employees in the staff meeting, upon which the memo was based. 
The wider net loss was partly due to fair value appreciation on convertible redeemable preferred shares, according to the person. 

Beijing-based ByteDance declined to comment on its financials or Zhang's remarks. 
It had 1.9 billion global monthly users in December 2020 for all its apps including TikTok, its Chinese version Douyin and news aggregator Jinri Toutiao.

Investing.com -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shares were down by more than 1% in Thursday’s premarket trading following Australia’s decision to limit the company’s COVID-19 vaccine shots to those aged 60 and above.
Australia has administered 3.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and it has been linked to 60 cases of blood clots, the government said. So far, two people have died, which the country's health minister Greg Hunt said has driven the policy shift, according to Reuters.
Australia in April moved to limit the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 50 years old.
Several European Union member states have stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 years to 65 years, due to very rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people.
Australia in April expanded its order of  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine to 40 million doses, while it has also ordered 25 million shots from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Australia's amended vaccine policy comes as the country's most populous state battles to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases, Reuters said."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, after the Federal Reserve took a hawkish turn, forecasting interest rates increases as early as 2023.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 90 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 60 points, or 0.4%.
The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting concluded Wednesday with the central bank raising its growth and inflation forecasts, starting a discussion about when to start tapering its bond buying, as well as pointing to two rate hikes of 25 basis points in 2023, a year earlier than expected.
“With many governors lifting dots for 2023 and some also for 2022, tapering in late 2021 becomes much more likely,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, “which also made for a hawkish readthrough in sharp contrast to the response to the latest couple of surprisingly high inflation reports.“
The main Wall Street indices are all more than 30% higher over the last year, near record levels, helped in no small part by the fiscal and monetary largesse of the U.S. authorities. This assistance, at least from the Fed, may be coming to an end sooner than expected. 
For this to happen, the labor market has to continue to improve, which tees up the release of the weekly U.S. jobless claims numbers, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
This is expected to show the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time falling to 359,000 for the week ending June 5, the fewest since the pandemic began.
In corporate news, CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC) stock slumped over 45% premarket Thursday after the drugmaker’s main candidate for a Covid-19 vaccine failed to meet its main goal in late stage clinical trials.  
In terms of earnings, investors will digest numbers from computer software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and food retailer Kroger (NYSE:KR), among others.
Crude oil prices edged lower Thursday, with a stronger dollar in the wake of the Fed meeting weighing and offsetting signs of a tightening market.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.4% at $71.90 a barrel, while Brent was down 0.4% at $74.08. Additionally, the dollar index climbed 0.7% to 91.795 after surging nearly 1% overnight, its biggest rise since March of last year, and EUR/USD fell 0.5% to 1.1932, continuing the overnight drop of over 1%, its biggest fall since April 2020.
A stronger greenback makes oil priced in dollars more expensive in other currencies, potentially weighing on demand. 
Still, losses have been relatively minor Thursday, certainly when compared to the recent gains, as the market has been underpinned by signs of strengthened diamond in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles dropped sharply last week, falling by 7.355 million barrels for the week to Jun. 11, according to the Energy Information Administration.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>","Highlights of the 17-year Airbus, Boeing trade war","(Reuters) - The United States and Britain on Thursday announced a five-year truce in a long-running transatlantic battle over aircraft subsidies, mirroring a similar deal reached by Washington and Brussels a day earlier.
The agreements resolve - at least for now - long-running conflicts over government aid provided to U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Europe's Airbus, allowing the United States and Europe to focus more countering China, which is rapidly developing its own commercial aircraft industry.
The World Trade Organization had found the world's two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of subsidies in a pair of cases dating back to 2004, and ultimately allowed both sides to impose billions of dollars in punitive tariffs.
Here are highlights of the feud that has spawned thousands of pages of rulings, triggered threats of tit-for-tat tariffs on goods from plane parts to whisky and left both sides claiming victory while racking up an estimated $100 million in costs.
2004
The U.S. seeks talks with the EU and Airbus host nations Britain, France, Germany and Spain over alleged unfair subsidies via government loans. Washington terminates a 1992 U.S.-EU agreement covering support for Airbus and Boeing. The EU files a complaint on U.S. aid for Boeing.
2005
The WTO launches twin probes into public support for Boeing and Airbus after bilateral negotiations fail.
2006
Airbus announces a new A350 jetliner for which it will seek further government loans from host nations.
2009
The WTO issues an interim ruling that some European aid provided to Airbus violated a ban on export subsidies - a type of aid deemed most harmful and therefore automatically banned.
2010
The WTO demands a halt to unfair aid for jets including the Airbus A380 superjumbo. It says some government loans for the jet amount to ""prohibited"" export subsidies. But it rejects a U.S. request to include aid for the newer A350 in the case.
2011
The EU loses an appeal and is given until December to comply. However the WTO drops its finding that the A380 loans are in the ""prohibited"" category, softening its earlier ruling. 
A separate WTO panel partially backs the EU in its counter-case alleging $19 billion of support for Boeing from the U.S. government, NASA and various states and municipalities, and rules against aid for Boeing worth at least $5.3 billion.
2012
WTO appeal judges broadly uphold the ruling against U.S. support for Boeing. Both sides say they have complied with WTO rulings, while accusing the other side of failing to do so.
2013
Boeing announces the twin-engined 777X and agrees to build it in Washington state shortly after the local legislature agrees $8.7 billion in new aerospace industry tax breaks.
2014
The EU opens a second front in the trade battle by launching a separate complaint against the 777X tax breaks granted by Washington state and this time chooses a faster, all-or-nothing approach by targeting them purely as ""prohibited"" subsidies - without the usual fallback of a second, softer claim.
2016
After a year-long lull in the main dispute, the WTO says the EU failed to comply with its earlier rulings on Airbus. It also agrees for the first time to target aid for the new A350 but rejects U.S. calls to put this in the ""prohibited"" category.
In November, the WTO rules tax breaks surrounding the development of the Boeing 777X - the subject of the EU's second case - did fall into the more severe ""prohibited"" category.
2017
WTO appeal judges reverse that ""prohibited subsidy"" ruling on 777X, bringing an abrupt halt to the EU's second case. 
In the EU's main case, the WTO largely clears the United States of maintaining unfair support for Boeing but says it has failed to withdraw the earlier Washington state tax breaks. The EU appeals unsuccessfully.
2018
In May, the WTO again rules that the EU has failed to halt all subsidies to Airbus. The United States threatens sanctions on billions of dollars of European products. Both sides enter arbitration to determine the scope of tariffs.
2019
In March, the WTO says the United States has again failed to halt subsidized tax breaks to Boeing in Washington state. The two sides disagree widely in public over the amount of subsidy faulted by the WTO.
Both sides accuse the other of refusing to negotiate any settlement and unveil lists of billions of dollars of proposed tariffs on each others' goods.
WTO arbitrators award the U.S. the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of annual EU imports. In October, Washington imposes 10% tariffs on most Airbus jets and 25% duties on products https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-wto-aircraft-tariffs-factbox-idUKKBN1WH1DZ ranging from cheese to olives and single-malt whisky.
In December, the WTO rejects EU claims that it no longer provides subsidies, prompting Washington to warn of tariffs on a wider range of European goods.
2020
The United States announces an increase in tariffs on aircraft imported from the EU to 15% from 10%.
In March, the Washington state legislature votes to remove a contested aerospace tax break that had benefited Boeing.
In October, following delays due to the coronavirus crisis, the WTO grants Brussels permission to impose tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods over subsidies for Boeing. 
The European Commission offers to pull back from imposing tariffs if Washington withdraws its existing tariffs.
But the U.S. Trade Representative's office says Brussels has ""no legal basis"" to impose the tariffs since a tax break provided by Washington State to Boeing has been repealed.
Britain, no longer part of the EU but still a large player in the dispute, decides to suspend tariffs on Boeing jets and other U.S. goods to create goodwill for separate agreement with Washington. Both the EU and U.S. snub the offer.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer says U.S. and Europe should cooperate in opposing future subsidies used by China to build its commercial aircraft industry.
U.S. increases tariffs on certain EU products, including aircraft parts and non-sparkling wines from France and Germany.
2021
In March, Britain and the United States agree to suspend tariffs to allow serious negotiations to proceed.
Brussels and Washington follow suit, suspending tariffs related to the aircraft dispute for four months through July 10.

At a June summit, U.S. and EU leaders hail an agreement to resolve the dispute. It involves extending the tariff suspension for five years while pledging to tackle aerospace funding by ""non-market actors"" such as their new rival China.
Two days later, Britain and the United States reach a similar deal, ensuring that retaliatory tariffs remain suspended.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Reinsurers look at dumping coal from bulk-buy policies in green gambit,"By Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) -Major reinsurers have already pulled back from providing bespoke cover for coal projects as part of efforts to meet global climate change commitments, but now comes the hard part - finding ways to exclude coal from bulk-buy contracts, known as ""treaty"" reinsurance. 
Reinsurance companies help to share the burden of insurance risks by underwriting frontline insurers. Any restrictions they impose will have a knock-on impact on insurance policies on offer to companies.
Most reinsurers have stepped back from offering insurers bespoke or direct cover for coal projects, but many still underwrite the industry through treaty reinsurance, where hundreds of insurers' policies are bundled together. 
The process of unbundling treaty reinsurance to search for coal exposure is tough, yet pressure is building on the industry from investors and regulators to do more to reflect the growing risks of climate change in how they underwrite. Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) is already doing this.
If more reinsurers do cut back this cover, specialist commercial insurers such as those operating in the Lloyd's of London market will feel the impact, as will suppliers to the coal industry or those businesses which derive even a small portion of their revenues from coal.
""The first consequence is insurance is harder to get, the second consequence is it's expensive, the third consequence is there are all sorts of caveats on it and at the extreme you might not be offered it"", said Paul Merrey, insurance partner at KPMG.
A rail contractor to Adani Enterprises' giant Australian coal project last month, for example, asked the Australian government for help to obtain insurance that it was not able to secure from the market. 
Five of the world's six largest reinsurers - Swiss Re, Munich Re, Hannover Re, SCOR and Lloyd's of London - have already scaled back bespoke coverage for coal projects. But only Swiss Re, in a statement in March, has said it will go further and tighten its treaty reinsurance stance.
Munich Re and Hannover Re told Reuters they are working with their insurance clients to cut their own exposure further.
""We want to keep the dialogue and push for change together,"" said Jean-Jacques Henchoz, chief executive of Hannover Re, though he added that: ""It's not happening in a couple of weeks, it's taking a bit of time."" 
Munich Re and Hannover Re said they were working out how to assess what was inside their treaty reinsurance books.
""For coal we are very confident that this is something we will get transparency on, but of course it's much more difficult than doing it for the direct and facultative business,"" said Michael Menhart, head of economics, sustainability and public affairs at Munich Re. Facultative refers to single risk cover.
Lloyd's of London, which has around 100 syndicate members and launched a strategy on coal for the first time last year, said by email that it would be producing further guidance later this year. Scor did not respond to a request for comment.
SLOW GOING
For the global reinsurance industry as a whole, treaty reinsurance typically makes up the majority of business in the $500-billion-plus market, industry sources say.
Swiss Re has said it will introduce thermal coal exposure thresholds in its treaty business with insurers as a first step towards full phase-out by 2040, though it has not yet specified the thresholds.
""We worked internally with the treaty desks around the world to understand their coal exposures,"" said Martin Weymann, head of sustainability, emerging and political risk management at Swiss Re.
""We took quite a bit of time to filter out which risks are most exposed.""
Henchoz at Hannover Re said in terms of excluding coal from treaty business, it was important to scratch below the surface and try to be very concrete on how to achieve an official target.
Lloyd's, which industry sources say tends to be more cautious about taking steps on climate than the major European reinsurers, said its syndicate members were moving away from fossil fuels. Lloyd's said the market wanted ""to ensure that existing customers have time to transition their businesses and that we don't create unnecessary cliff edges"".
Pressure group ShareAction said in a recent report that the fact that treaty reinsurance can provide cover for coal risked undermining the progress being made through restricting bespoke cover.
Even if more of the major reinsurers move to stop treaty cover of coal, the impact could take some time to fully work its way through the system, as other reinsurers look to take up the slack.
""In the short term, there might be some opportunistic players,"" said Swiss Re's Weymann, adding, however, that shareholders were leading the pressure for longer-term change.

Isabelle Santenac, global insurance leader at EY, however, said that rather than exclusion, the industry should instead use its influence to engage with corporate clients to help them to make the transition more quickly to a greener economy.
""If you stop working for those companies, those companies will find another insurer to underwrite that risk, and then you can say 'what has changed for the planet? Nothing'.""

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Russian lawmakers vote to force U.S. tech giants to open local offices,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers passed legislation on Thursday that would oblige U.S. tech giants to open offices in Russia by January 2022 or face punitive measures, part of a push by Russia to beef up what it calls internet ""sovereignty"". 
Russia has cracked down on U.S. internet companies in recent months and slowed down Twitter's internet traffic since March to punish it for not deleting what Moscow says is banned content. 
The new legislation, which passed its third and final reading in the lower house of parliament, requires foreign sites with more than half a million daily users in Russia to set up a local branch or Russian legal entity. 
The lack of such a requirement currently allows foreign sites to formally remain outside of Russia's jurisdiction, the bill's authors said. 

Websites that do not comply would be marked as being non-compliant on search engines, they could be excluded from search engine results, and banned from advertising in Russia and for Russians, the parliament said on its website. 
The bill needs to be approved by the upper house of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law. That is widely expected to happen.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Cathay Pacific Airways said on Thursday non-local pilots based in Hong Kong had been granted work permit extensions, two weeks after it launched a recruitment drive for local pilots and closed bases in Australia and New Zealand.
However, the airline said the government had rejected work permit renewals for non-local flight cabin crew based in Hong Kong, in a decision that will lead to an undisclosed number of job losses.
Pilots on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 freighter fleet and training captains will receive three-year extensions, those on the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 fleets will receive a one-year extension and those on the A330 fleet will be granted a six-month extension, the company said in a statement.
Cathay last year closed its regional arm, Cathay Dragon, which had flown A330s and A320s, putting hundreds of local pilots out of work, while pilots on work permits at the main brand remained employed.
Cathay pilots with temporary visas had received shorter than usual renewals since the Cathay Dragon closure, two sources who were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter previously told Reuters. 
The airline, which lacks a domestic market at a time when international borders are largely shut, reported a 99.3% fall in April passenger numbers, compared with pre-pandemic levels in April 2019.
It is heavily reliant on its 747 freighters for revenue due to the plunge in passenger demand.

Most airlines only hire locals and permanent residents, but Cathay, like many of the large Middle Eastern carriers, has typically relied heavily on foreign pilots.
In Hong Kong, expatriates can gain permanent residency after seven years and many of its local pilots are citizens of countries like Britain and Australia. However, newer hires would not meet the residency requirement.

(Reuters) -Premier Inn-owner  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) said hotel bookings in its tourist locations picked up in the run-up to the summer season, lifting its shares even as Britain delayed plans to ease pandemic restrictions.
The Dunstable-based company said it traded ""significantly ahead of the market"", though total sales still fell 69.8% in the 13 weeks ended May 27 from pre-COVID-19 levels.
The shares rose 4% by 0739 GMT to be the best performers on the FTSE 100 index.
""Our forward bookings continue to improve, benefiting from the anticipated post-lockdown bounce in leisure demand, and a continued gradual improvement in business bookings,"" Chief Executive Officer Alison Britain said. 
The rate of decline slowed in the period from May 17 to June 14, when overnight leisure stays were allowed, with total UK accommodation sales during those weeks down just 27% from pre-pandemic levels.
The travel and leisure sector is showing signs of recovery as Britons have started booking domestic trips for the summer holiday season rather than foreign trips
By May 17, the company said 98% of its more than 800 Premier Inn hotels were open.
""A lack of air travel will push Britons to staycation at coastal towns in the UK, where roughly 15% of the group’s hotels are scattered,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Laura Hoy said. 

But with Britain now pushing back its plans to lift most social restrictions to July 19, Whitbread said a full recovery of leisure demand depended on the removal of remaining lockdown measures. 
The company opened 10 new hotels in the UK during the quarter. There are signs of recovery in Germany, too, where 19 of Whitbread's 30 hotels had opened.

PARIS (Reuters) -Cathay Pacific is working with Airbus to introduce ""reduced crew"" long-haul flights with a sole pilot in the cockpit much of the time, industry sources told Reuters.
The programme, known within Airbus as Project Connect, aims to certify its A350 jet for single-pilot operations during high-altitude cruise, starting in 2025 on Cathay passenger flights, the sources said.
High hurdles remain on the path to international acceptance. Once cleared, longer flights would become possible with a pair of pilots alternating rest breaks, instead of the three or four currently needed to maintain at least two in the cockpit.
That promises savings for airlines, amid uncertainty over the post-pandemic economics of intercontinental flying. But it is likely to encounter resistance from pilots already hit by mass layoffs, and safety concerns about aircraft automation.
Lufthansa has also worked on the single-pilot programme but currently has no plans to use it, a spokesman for the German carrier told Reuters.
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) confirmed its involvement but said no decision had been made on eventual deployment.
""While we are engaging with Airbus in the development of the concept of reduced crew operations, we have not committed in any way to being the launch customer,"" the Hong Kong carrier said.
Commercial implementation would first require extensive testing, regulatory approval and pilot training with ""absolutely no compromise on safety"", Cathay said.
""The appropriateness and effectiveness of any such rollout as well as (the) overall cost-benefit analysis (will) ultimately depend on how the pandemic plays out.""
It added: ""Having said that, we will continue to engage with Airbus and to support development of the concept.""
Airbus has previously disclosed plans to add single-pilot capability to the A350, but the airlines' participation had not been reported. Work has resumed after the COVID-19 crisis paused the programme, Chief Test Pilot Christophe Cail said.
""We've proven over decades we can enhance safety by putting the latest technology in aircraft,"" Cail told Reuters, declining to identify project partners. ""As for any design evolution, we are working with airlines.""
VITAL SIGNS
Safe deployment will require constant monitoring of the solo pilot's alertness and vital signs by on-board systems, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has said.
If the flight encounters a problem or the pilot flying is incapacitated, the resting copilot can be summoned within minutes. Both remain in the cockpit for take-off and landing.
""Typically on long-haul flights when you're at cruise altitude there's very little happening in the cockpit,"" EASA chief Patrick Ky told a German press briefing in January.
""It makes sense to say OK, instead of having two in the cockpit, we can have one in the cockpit, the other one taking a rest, provided we're implementing technical solutions which make sure that if the single one falls asleep or has any problem, there won't be any unsafe conditions.""
Pilot groups have voiced alarm.
""We struggle to understand the rationale,"" said Otjan de Bruijn, head of the European Cockpit Association representing EU pilots.
Invoking the 737 MAX crisis, which exposed Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s inappropriate links to U.S. regulators, De Bruijn said the programme's cost-cutting approach ""could lead to higher risks"".
Single-pilot operations, currently limited to planes with up to nine passengers, would need backing from U.N. aviation body ICAO and countries whose airspace they cross. China's support is key to any Cathay deployment.
EASA plans consultations this year and certification work in 2022, while acknowledging ""significant risk"" to the 2025 launch date, a spokesman said.
In a closed-door industry briefing this year, the agency suggested reduced-crew flights would begin with a single operator, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by Reuters.
EMERGENCY DESCENT
Airbus has designed an A350 autopilot upgrade and flight warning system changes to help a lone pilot manage failures, sources close to the project said. Use of a specially designed unisex toilet would be possible during the shift, in coordination with air traffic control.
The mid-sized plane is suitable because of its ""emergency descent"" feature that quickly reduces altitude without pilot input in the event of cabin depressurisation.
Proponents suggest single-pilot operations may be accepted by a flying public used to crew leaving the cockpit for bathroom breaks. They also point to higher error rates from human pilots than automated systems.
Both arguments miss the point, according to a source close to Lufthansa - who said the airline's executives were advised last year that the programme could not meet safety goals.
Flying solo for hours is a ""completely different story"", the source said, citing the 2009 AF447 disaster as an example of malfunctions occurring in cruise. The Air France A330's copilots lost control after its speed sensors failed over the Atlantic, while the captain was resting.
""Airbus would have had to make sure every situation can be handled autonomously without any pilot input for 15 minutes,"" the source said. ""And that couldn't be guaranteed."" 
Lufthansa has not withdrawn from Project Connect and remains involved as an adviser, its spokesman said.
While the airline has no plans to deploy single-pilot operations, he added, ""the suggestion that Lufthansa was an essential part of the project and then pulled back is not true.""
Single-pilot capability would add an A350 sales argument, experts say, and rival Boeing lacks an equivalent model with sufficient automation.
Filippo Tomasello, a former EASA official, said the payroll and accommodation savings for long-haul crew would not be lost on airlines.

""COVID may end up accelerating this evolution because it's putting tremendous economic pressure on aviation,"" Tomasello predicted.
""If EASA certifies this solution, airlines will use it.""

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 02:11AM ET</span>",Explainer-How will EU ban on 10 banks from bond sales impact markets and banks?,"By Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) - Ten banks have been excluded over past breaches of antitrust rules from European Union syndicated debt sales backing Brussels' up to 800 billion euro ($969 billion) COVID-19 recovery fund. 
Here's what the move means for EU debt sales, bond markets and the affected banks: 
WHICH BANKS ARE AFFECTED? 
Banks from all corners of the world are affected: U.S. lenders JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). as well as British peers  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and NatWest Group Plc are on the list. 
In continental Europe, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), Natixis SA and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA and UniCredit SpA are affected. Plus Japan's  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.. All banks declined to comment.
All on the list of 39 primary dealers responsible for managing debt sales -- syndicated and auctioned -- for the bloc and managing its debt trading in the secondary market.
Many are Europe's go-to banks in the public sector bond market; seven are among the top 10 fee earners from syndicated debt sales in this market since 2020, according to Dealogic. 
WHAT DID THEY DO? 
The ban relates to lenders found being part of three cartels in the past three years. One saw a number of banks fined over tinkering in FX spot markets between 2007-2013. Another one found a number of banks colluded on trading strategies and pricing between 2010-2015 on public sector bonds - debt issued by government-linked institutions. A third one related to a cartel of traders at various banks in the primary and secondary market for European government bonds. 
HOW BIG WILL FEE LOSSES BE?
Sitting out from syndications, where investment banks are hired by an issuer to sell debt directly on to end investors, means losing out on lucrative fees. Banks netted 20 million euros - 0.1% of the 20 billion euros - in fees from Tuesday's debut bond, according to Reuters calculations.
Fees vary with debt maturities; the longer the bond, the higher the fees. 
An average of its fees across all maturities for the remaining 60 billion euros of this year's long-term debt issuance would translate into a pool of another 66 million euros if all that debt were to be syndicated, Reuters calculations showed. Considering it will be divided among all banks participating, that's a relatively small amount compared to the $224 million top earner JPMorgan alone reaped from syndicated European public sector debt sales since the start of 2020, according to Dealogic. 
The EU also pays smaller fees for its recovery fund debt than European sovereigns. However, it currently issues all its debt through syndications and will rely on them much more heavily than sovereigns even after auctions start in September, meaning it is a fee source banks won't want to miss out on.
Exclusion also means smaller lenders could see their fee share increase. Graphic: EU syndication fees: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvooddjvd/4Xyrm-eu-syndication-fees-for-recovery-fund-bonds.png 
HOW LONG WILL THE BAN LAST? 
No timeline has been given. EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said the commission would work through information provided by banks on how they addressed the issues ""as fast as possible"".
Sources told Reuters some banks already submitted information, with the remaining ones expected to follow soon. This could mean some of the banned banks could get the green light to rejoin bond sales, the sources said. 
A senior debt banker at a primary dealer not banned said he expects at least a few of the banks to be re-admitted by September, when EU auctions begin.
WILL IT HIT LIQUIDITY? 
ECB bond buying has zapped some liquidity in the bloc's fixed income markets. Liquidity matters to investors, making it easier and cheaper to transact. 
Syndication fees are a key factor that motivate banks to participate in auctions that are much less lucrative but crucial to maintain liquidity. 

European governments have lost primary dealers in recent years as banks have judged the business to be less profitable. 
And having less major banks left to underwrite its syndications could also pose risks for the EU.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 01:52AM ET</span>",Probe into Mexico City metro crash blames structural failure,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Preliminary findings of an independent investigation into the deadly collapse of a Mexico City metro rail line last month showed the accident was caused by a structural fault, a senior city official said on Wednesday.
Jesus Esteva, head of Mexico City's public works department, said the probe by Norwegian firm DNV observed deficiencies in building materials used including bolts and deformation of structural supports in the part of the line that collapsed.
The initial report by DNV, an external auditor, found ""six deficiencies in the construction process"" that helped to bring about the accident.
""The aforementioned allows us to submit, on a preliminary basis, that the incident was sparked by a structural fault,"" Esteva told a news conference. Officials did not permit questions from reporters.
Further reports on the accident are due in the coming months, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said.
Deficiencies identified included the welding of bolts and their attachment to girders, missing bolts on some girders, different types of concrete used and unfinished or poorly executed welding, the city said.
The collapse, Mexico's biggest train accident in years, killed 26 people and put pressure on close allies of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as well as Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, Latin America's richest man.
The incident put a spotlight on Slim's construction business, Grupo Carso , which was involved in building the section of the Line 12 metro route that collapsed.
Grupo Carso said in a statement that it would not comment until the final report into the accident is published.
Sheinbaum has faced questions about the line's maintenance, and criticism has also been directed at Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was the driving force behind the construction of Line 12 when he was mayor of the capital from 2006 to 2012.
Both are close allies of Lopez Obrador and seen as possible successors to him in 2024 when his term ends.
Responding to the initial findings, Ebrard published a two-page statement defending how his administration built the line and said that aside from the final technical report, a broader inquiry should be held to review the ""entire decision-making process in the design, layout, supervision and maintenance of the work,"" as well as various studies on it in recent years.
The metro was built by a consortium of Mexico's ICA , Grupo Carso and French trainmaker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA.
Alstom last month said its role was limited to power supply, signaling, monitoring and control systems and some depot equipment, as well as testing some systems. 
The company will review the preliminary findings and had no further comment, a spokesperson said.
ICA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In May, ICA shared a document with a graphic showing it had built sections of Line 12 spanning 15 stations, and Carso five. Carso's section included where the track fell.

Sheinbaum said DNV will oversee analysis of the principal fault, and that she would be in touch with the companies involved in the line later today.
Line 12 had repeatedly been reviewed and declared safe by officials since it opened in 2012, but problems led to partial shutdowns from 2014 to 2015 for repairs.

Several other Southeast Asian airlines have already agreed restructuring plans or have sought approval for capital infusions and court-assisted debt relief.
PAL Holdings said consolidated revenue at the airline fell 64% to 55.3 billion pesos last year due to travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""Philippine Airlines will have a long way to go for recovery,"" the company said.
It is working on the final stages of a restructuring plan, including court-assisted protection, to improve the capital structure and meet obligations, it said. PAL Holdings had around $6 billion in liabilities as of end-December.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Blackstone Group Inc will take control of SOHO China Ltd in a HK$23.7 billion ($3.05 billion) deal and maintain its stock market listing, the Chinese office developer said in a filing on Wednesday, while the founders will retain a 9% stake. 
The U.S. private equity firm will offer HK$5 per share, 31.6% higher than the last closing price of HK$3.8 on Friday, in what would be its largest real estate deal in China. 
SOHO China's shares jumped as much as 25.8% to HK$4.78 early on Thursday, as they resumed trading after being suspended since Tuesday.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX), which currently owns around 6 million square metres (65 million square feet) of properties in China, is seeking to expand there as it is confident about the country's long-term economic prospects and the Beijing and Shanghai office market, the filing said.
SOHO China, a major developer well known for its futuristic office buildings on the mainland, has 1.3 million square meters of commercial properties in the country. 
The company is 64% owned by the husband-and-wife founding team of Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Zhang Xin. After the deal, they will become its second-largest shareholder with a 9% interest. 
The offer is conditional on Chinese competition authorities granting clearance, the filing added. 
Founded in 1995, SOHO China went public in Hong Kong in 2007. Its shares have gained 62% in the past month and it had a market value of $2.55 billion at the stock's last close, according to Refinitiv data. 

The company has been scouting for buyers for its prime commercial property assets as the founders looked to shift their focus to overseas markets. Reuters reported last year Blackstone was in exclusive talks to take SOHO China private in a $4 billion deal, but later halted the talks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Air Force said on Wednesday it is surveying the aircraft industry to learn if another manufacturer has the capacity or interest to make the next tranche of midair refueling tankers similar to the recently purchased KC-46.
The Air Force's newest refueling tankers, the KC-46 Pegasus made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, have been plagued by performance challenges including defects with an on-board video system and the boom that connects the tanker to aircraft seeking refueling.
Despite the challenges the KC-46 aircraft faces, during Congressional testimony on Wednesday the Acting Secretary of the Air Force John Roth said ""at this point we don't see the economic or business sense of recompeting the contract.""
Mike Hafer, Boeing's lead for sales for the KC-46, said the company is ready for the competition for the next tranche.
""We are proud of the KC-46 and it's accomplishments,"" he said. ""Boeing is poised to provide advanced capabilities going forward. There in no other refueling tanker in the world that meets the Air Force's requirements.""
The Air Force's survey is the first step in the process of buying the next batch of refueling tankers. The Air Force said the tranche of 140 to 160 jets would follow Boeing's current contract to produce 179 KC-46's as the Pentagon replaces hundreds of Eisenhower-era KC-135's still in service.
Wednesday's ""sources sought"" document was released as part of its market research, the Air Force said.
The Air Force has sought to replace its tankers in three lots. Wednesday's announcement is the beginning of the formal process to buy the second batch.
The Air Force hopes to ""determine if there exists an adequate number of qualified interested contractors capable of providing solutions to meet the requirement.""
The survey comes days after the United States and the European Union agreed to a truce in their near 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies.

The two sides have been battling since 2004 in parallel cases at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing and European rival Airbus, which each argued exposed the other to unfair competition.
Airbus, won a $35 billion contract in 2008 to build tankers for the U.S. Air Force. But the deal was overturned amid political pressure and the Air Force re-ran the competition which Boeing ultimately won for 179 of its 767-based tankers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday issued a directive for Boeing Co requiring operators of 737 MAX airplanes to conduct additional inspections for the plane's automated flight control system.
The directive makes mandatory instructions released by Boeing (NYSE:BA) in December that recommend planes with more than 6,000 flight hours be subject to specific electronic checks.
MCAS, an automated flight control system on the 737 MAX, was tied to two fatal 737 MAX crashes that led to the plane's 20-month grounding that was lifted in November.
Boeing said it ""fully supports the FAA mandate ""requiring functional checks at certain intervals to the digital flight control system, stabilizer trim, and the primary and secondary aisle stand stabilizer.""
The three repetitive inspections are to be done during existing maintenance programs, the FAA said, ""to ensure the continued functioning of certain systems throughout the life of the airplane.""
The FAA also issued a notice on Wednesday called a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) ""to highlight the importance of these inspections to other international regulators and to operators outside the United States.""
The directive impacts about 72 U.S.-registered airplanes and 389 airplanes worldwide, the FAA said.
The FAA said the directive is necessary because a ""potential latent failure of a flight control system function"" if combined with ""unusual flight maneuvers or with another flight control system failure"" could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

The FAA said all operators of U.S.-registered 737 MAX airplanes have already included these inspections in their maintenance programs. 
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 worldwide after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. The grounding was not lifted until November 2020 by the FAA after Boeing made significant safety upgrades and improvements in pilot training as well as adding new safeguards to MCAS.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Thursday morning, with U.S. counterparts extending losses. Investors continue to digest the latest U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision that indicated a pickup in the expected pace of its asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.14% by 10:11 PM ET (2:11 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.75%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.30%. Employment data for May released earlier in the day was better than expected, with the employment change at 115,200 while the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.05%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.21% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.63%. Economic data released on Wednesday said that industrial production grew a worse-than-expected 8.8% year-on-year in May while the unemployment rate was 5.2%.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped eight basis points, while five- and seven-year equivalents rose even more as investors scrambled to reprice the rate increases timing.
Emerging market currencies in Asia, led by the South Korean won, tumbled after the dollar recorded its biggest jump in a year. Crude oil fell as the strengthening dollar reduced the appeal of commodities priced in the currency while gold also tumbled.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed any risk of an immediate interest rate increase as the central bank handed down the decision on Wednesday. He added that officials had begun a discussion about asset tapering and that two interest rate hikes are expected by the end of 2023.
However, Powell also appeared to temper the initial reaction to a so-called dot plot revision, reiterating that the Fed is not considering rate increases for now. The central bank will also continue asset purchases at a $120 billion monthly pace until “substantial further progress” had been made on employment and inflation.
Investors, who had hoped that the decision would provide clues as to when the Fed would begin to taper its unprecedented COVID-19 stimulus, were still caught off-guard by the faster-than-anticipated timetable.
“The move in the dot plot raised concerns that maybe even though the Fed now believes they are not going to be raising rates anytime soon that the timetable might be tightened up, might be moved forward... we’ve gotten to a point that has everyone feeling slightly less comfortable in assuming that the Fed is going to be able to be as patient for as long as they would like,” Natwest Markets co-head of global economics and chief U.S. economist Michelle Girard told Bloomberg.
With the Fed decision handed down, investors now await decisions from the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank later in the day. The Bank of Japan will hand its decision down on Friday.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will testify on the federal budget before a House of Representatives panel later in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The prices of so-called meme stocks may be distorted because the majority of trades in those names are executed away from public exchanges where share price formation occurs, the head of the New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday.
""Meme stocks,"" which often start as low-priced, highly shorted stocks that users of online forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets rally behind, are some of the most heavily traded and volatile shares on any given day. 
Shares of companies like video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and theater chain operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) have whipsawed this year, with GameStop having rallied more than 1,600% in January alone, prompting trading halts by some brokers and sparking Congressional and regulatory hearings. 
""In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE. 
""That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,"" she said at a conference hosted by CNBC. 
Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic. 
In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said.
The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better. 
Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.

But the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week. 
The review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.

An independent investigation has alleged that Toshiba management colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block foreign investors from gaining board influence, reviving concerns about Japanese corporate governance and prompting calls for Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama to resign.

""These are the two major tasks if I remain as a board member and the chairperson of the board,"" Nagayama was quoted as saying in the Journal interview. 
“When I see the whole thing set in the right order, it’s an appropriate time I consider myself to resign.”

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple boss Tim Cook took aim on Wednesday at proposed European rules aimed at curbing the power of U.S. tech giants, saying they could pose security and privacy risks to iPhones.
Cook, in his first public comments about the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said parts were good but others were not. He said he feared the draft rules would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store, or ""side-loading"". 
""You take an example here where I don't think it's in the best interest (of the user): the current DMA language that is being discussed would force side-loading on the iPhone,"" the Apple CEO, speaking remotely, said at VivaTech, France´s biggest tech conference.
""And so this would be an ultimate way of getting apps onto the iPhone,"" he said. ""It would destroy the security of the iPhone, and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we've built into the App Store or the privacy intrusion labels and app-tracking transparency,"" he added.

Earlier this month, EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who is leading the European Parliament scrutiny of the draft rules, said he wanted to beef up the legislation and narrow its scope to just big companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Apple would take part in the debate and try to find a way forward, Cook said.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 08:31PM ET</span>","U.S. lawmakers press GM CEO on California emissions, Mexico labor","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra faced questions from U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday on a workers’ vote at a company plant in Mexico and the company's support for emissions reductions.
Barra met with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior Democrats on Capitol Hill, and touted the company's decision announced earlier in the day to boost spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $35 billion through 2025.
""We're committed to an all-EV future,"" Barra said in brief comments to Reuters after the meeting. ""We had a lot of conversations about a lot of things that we can do to enable EV adoption.""
Until November, GM backed the Trump administration's effort to block California from setting tougher emissions standards than the federal government.
Pelosi had expressed disappointment with GM's support for Republican President Donald Trump's position on the emissions rules, a source briefed on the matter said, and she urged GM to work with California and the Biden administration to reach the strongest possible vehicle emissions standards.
The administration of Democratic President Joe Biden is set to unveil revised vehicle emissions rules in July.
GM said last week it backs emissions reductions outlined in a 2019 deal struck between California and other major automakers, but wants the federal government to endorse changes to speed the adoption of electric vehicles.
Barra also faced questions about a delayed worker vote at a GM plant in Silao, Mexico.
Mexico's Labor Ministry scrapped an initial union-led vote in April, citing ""serious irregularities,"" and later ordered the GM union to hold a new ballot within 30 days of its May 11 statement. No vote has been scheduled
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office in May asked Mexico to review potential labor abuses at the Silao plant under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Last month, U.S. Representatives Dan Kildee, Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer, all Democrats, pressed GM to answer questions about potential abuses in Mexico.
""We want to see some real demonstration of embracing the labor standards in Mexico -- more than compliance,"" Kildee told Reuters after the meeting. ""The situation in Silao -- I raised that with Mary -- that's a problem.""
The Democrats urged GM to commit to providing workers with physical copies of the contract, publicly posting contracts and to meet other requirements.
Kildee offered additional steps GM could take to support workers and meet USMCA requirements, and the three lawmakers followed up with a written list of suggested actions, congressional aides said.

The suggestions ""would be tangible demonstrations of GM's commitment to lead on compliance with the new labor standards,"" Kildee told Reuters.
Earlier Wednesday, some House lawmakers on a trade panel, including Kildee, had a virtual meeting with Mexico's ambassador to the United States in which the GM labor issued was raised.

For example, Blackberry (TSX:BB) has seen its shares soar twice this year. That doesn't make it a great buy though. Instead, David Cohne recommends VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW),  PTC  Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), and Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP).As I’ve mentioned before, 2021 looks to be the year of the meme stock. These stocks have seen their shares soar this year based on trader sentiment in Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets subreddit. For the most part, corporate performance has not played a role in their gains. Instead, it’s all about social media attention.
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has been a Reddit favorite this year. The stock spiked 281% from January 4th to January 27th and then imploded shortly thereafter. Recently, the stock trended up again as meme stocks have made a comeback over the past month. BB gained another 90% this month, though the stock has since returned some of those gains. From a fundamental standpoint, I don’t believe BB is a good stock to own right now.
My opinion is backed up by our quantitative POWR Ratings system that has assigned BB an overall grade of D, translating into a Sell rating. As much as I miss my old Blackberry phones, the stock just isn’t a great buy. However, there are software stocks that are definitely worth considering. VMware Inc. (VMW), PTC Inc. (PTC), and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) are all rated a Buy and have multiple growth drivers, setting them up for success this year, which is why I am highlighting them below.

Nadella, who took over as CEO in 2014 from Steve Ballmer, has been instrumental in scaling up its business including billion-dollar acquisitions like LinkedIn,  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) and ZeniMax.
The company said Thompson, who took over as chairman from the software giant's co-founder Bill Gates in 2014, will serve as lead independent director.
The top-level executive change comes just over a year after Gates stepped down from the board, saying he would focus on philanthropic works of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's biggest charities.
The company had last month said it conducted a probe into Gates' involvement with an employee almost 20 years ago after it was told in 2019 that he had tried to start a romantic relationship with the person. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had declined to comment on whether its board had decided Gates should go.
The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents per share payable Sept. 9.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fusion Acquisition Chief Executive John James is in talks to launch a new blank-check company which could soon file for a London listing with the aim of becoming the first to take advantage of a new British SPAC regime, sources told Reuters.
James, who runs two existing SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) - Fusion Acquisition Corp and Fusion Acquisition Corp II - is working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on a third Fusion investment platform, the sources said.
The plan, backed by Fusion Chairman Jim Ross who spent more than two decades focused on exchange traded funds, is the latest by a SPAC entrepreneur who has turned serial investor during the blank-check company boom of 2020 and 2021.
Investors have poured more than $300 billion into listing these shell companies before they identify and acquire a business, effectively writing the backers a blank-check. 
JPMorgan declined to comment. Fusion, James and Ross were not immediately available for comment. 
Fusion's choice of London comes as post-Brexit Britain scrambles to make the capital more competitive in one of the hottest areas in finance, with new rules expected to come in by ""early summer,"" according to the Financial Conduct Authority.
Bankers say around 30 potential SPAC sponsors, who are generally well-known, deep pocketed institutions or individuals, are in discussions with regulators in London and across Europe over their plans to go public as the U.S. market faces a decline in demand. 
One of the sources said James wanted his latest Fusion vehicle to gain attention by being the first blank-check company to list under a new SPAC regime in London, which avoids locking investors in for an uncertain period of time.
The upcoming changes are meant to help Britain better compete with other European hubs including Amsterdam which has so far won the lion's share of SPAC listings in Europe. 
James, who is also the co-founder and chairman of Singapore-based fintech firm BetaSmartz, is looking to raise about $300 million for a new vehicle which will target a wide range of financial companies including asset managers and insurers with disruptive technologies, the sources said.

The first Fusion platform, set up in 2020, merged with digital finance firm MoneyLion in February just before the SPAC boom in the United States cooled after new SEC requirements to scrutinise warrants, which are often issued by SPACs.
Fusion Acquisition II raised $435 million on Feb. 26.

(Reuters) - The three main Wall Street indexes all closed down on Wednesday, as U.S. Federal Reserve officials unnerved investors with indications that the central bank could begin rising interest rates in 2023, a year earlier than expected.
New projections saw a majority of 11 of 18 U.S. central bank officials pencil in at least two quarter-percentage-point rate increases for 2023. Officials also pledged to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery.
The Fed cited an improved economic outlook, with overall economic growth expected to hit 7% this year. Still, investors were surprised to learn officials were mulling rate hikes earlier than 2024.
""At first blush, the dot plot which projected two hikes by 2023 was more hawkish than expected, and markets reacted as such,"" said Daniel Ahn, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose on the Fed news, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose to a six-week peak. 
With inflation rising faster than expected and the economy bouncing back quickly, the market had been looking for clues of when the Fed may alter the policies put into place last year to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, including a massive bond-buying program.
The Fed reiterated its promise to await ""substantial further progress"" before beginning to shift to policies tuned to a fully open economy. It also held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and said it will continue to buy $120 billion in bonds each month to fuel the economic recovery.
""Chair Powell has signaled, while the committee is not yet ready to taper, it is now in the minds of the committee. They've retired the phrase 'thinking about thinking about tapering', and we expect that in the next few meetings, the committee will likely formally start discussions of tapering,"" BNP's Ahn said. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.66 points, or 0.77%, to 34,033.67, the S&P 500 lost 22.89 points, or 0.54%, to 4,223.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.17 points, or 0.24%, to 14,039.68.
Only two of the S&P's 11 main sector indexes ended in positive territory: consumer discretionary and retail.
The decliners were led by utilities, materials, and consumer staples. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.90 billion shares, compared with the 10.38 billion average over the last 20 trading days. 
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 30 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday again delayed a decision on whether to approve an application for what would be the country's first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), filing a request for public consultation over concerns about market manipulation.
The move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday was the second delay for the VanEck Bitcoin Trust's proposed bitcoin ETF after an extended delay in April.
Analysts say the regulator is worried it is does not have proper surveillance over crypto exchanges to ensure adequate investor protections are in place.
Any adoption of a bitcoin ETF by new SEC chair Gary Gensler could be key for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as it would allow financial institutions and retail traders to gain exposure without having to invest directly, they added.
In its request for consultation, the SEC asked for views on the proposed Trust's susceptibility to manipulation and its ability to prevent fraudulent acts. It also sought comment on the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets and the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an ETF.

Applications are reviewed within 45-day windows and the agency can take up to 240 days to make a decision. 
VanEck filed its ETF proposal at the end of 2020, with Cboe BZX agreeing to act as VanEck’s exchange partner earlier this year.

The COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for spacious and more expensive homes as millions of Americans work from home and take classes remotely.
But the health crisis has hurt the homebuilders' ability to ramp up construction due to labor supply disruptions as well as shortage of lumber and other raw materials. This has pushed up prices as buyers scramble to get hold of available inventory.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN)'s homebuilding gross margin rose by 450 basis points to 26.1% in the three months ended May 31, a record for the second quarter, helped by higher-than-expected sales price per home.
The No. 2 U.S. homebuilder also raised its average sales price forecast by 5% to $420,000, while reaffirming its outlook for annual deliveries of between 62,000 homes and 64,000 homes. 
Shares of the company were, however, trading flat, as higher prices amid supply shortage stoked fears of home purchases becoming less affordable and hampering a recovery in sales. 
U.S. new home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units in April.
Analysts have said that some buyers are likely getting priced out of the market as prices continue to rise. 
Lennar's orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 32% to 17,157 homes in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 16,715 homes, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

The homebuilder said its quarterly home deliveries increased by about 14% to 14,493 homes, topping Wall Street's estimate of 14,326. Average price for homes delivered rose by about 6% to $413,000.
Excluding items, Lennar earned $2.95 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $2.36. Total revenue rose 21.6% to $6.43 billion and was ahead of expectation of $5.91 billion.

The deal would combine the second and third largest of the ""Big Three"" global insurance brokers, the department said. The third is Marsh McLennan.
Aon and Willis, which was formed in a 2016 merger, put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for coverage ranging from airlines to large sporting events.
The complaint cites an unnamed Aon executive who told colleagues, ""We have more leverage than we think we do and will have even more when (the) Willis deal is closed. .... We operate in an oligopoly which not everyone understands.""
The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, listed five areas of concern including identifying appropriate health benefits plans for big customers and plans for property, casualty, and financial risk for large customers.
In a joint statement, Aon and Willis said they disagreed with the Justice Department's action, ""which reflects a lack of understanding of our business, the clients we serve and the marketplaces in which we operate.""
The companies added: ""We continue to make material progress with other regulators around the world and remain fully committed to the benefits of our combination.""
This month, Aon announced it sold some assets to private equity firm Aquiline Capital Partners and tech firm Alight for $1.4 billion, in a bid to get U.S. approval. The department called the proposed divestitures insufficient.
""American companies and consumers rely on competition between Aon and Willis Towers Watson to lower prices for crucial services, such as health and retirement benefits consulting,"" said Attorney General Merrick Garland.

The deal was expected to get the EU antitrust green light within weeks. Reuters reported on April 28 that the European Commission would clear the mega deal after Aon offered to sell substantial assets.
London-headquartered Aon clinched the deal a year ago to create the world's largest insurance broker ahead of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC). Insurers have been pressured by rising claims and challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Electric vehicle company Workhorse Group filed a legal challenge on Wednesday to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) decision in February to award a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles.
The contract could be worth more than $6 billion in total. It allows for delivery over 10 years of between 50,000 and 165,000 of a mix of internal combustion-powered and battery-electric vehicles.
Workhorse had proposed building an all-electric vehicle fleet for USPS and has support of many U.S. lawmakers. USPS did not immediately comment. The bid protest was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under seal.
USPS declined to comment on the challenge but said ""preproduction design, tooling and facility preparation are proceeding on schedule with the first (next generation delivery vehicles) estimated to appear on carrier routes in 2023.""
Workhorse said in a statement it could not disclose further details ""but will provide updates when appropriate and as permitted under its non-disclosure agreement."" A judge will likely unseal a version of the complaint in the coming weeks.
Reuters reported the planned bid challenge earlier Wednesday sending its shares up more than 10%. Shares closed up 5.3% in heavier than normal trading.
Oshkosh Defense declined to comment on Workhorse's protest but said it looks ""forward to getting these highly capable vehicles into the hands of mail carriers.""
Last month, the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee voted to authorize $8 billion for USPS.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has committed to at least 10% of the fleet being electric vehicles but he said in a letter in March to lawmakers that with government assistance the USPS could commit to making a majority of the fleet electric within 10 years. He added that the USPS needs about $8 billion to electrify the new fleet to the ""maximum extent"" feasible.
In January, President Joe Biden vowed to replace the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models and has called for funding to electrify the fleet.

New USPS vehicles will include air conditioning and heating, improved ergonomics, and advanced vehicle safety technology including air bags and 360-degree cameras. Most current delivery vehicles do not have air conditioning or modern safety features.
A 2020 report said USPS spent $706.2 million in maintenance costs for 141,057 delivery vehicles.

However, the sector has experienced some profit-taking over the past month, setting up a buying opportunity. 3 housing-related stocks to consider buying on the dip are Hovnanian Enterprises (NYSE:HOV), Tempur Sealy International (NYSE:TPX), and Industrie Natuzzi (NTZ).One of the most remarkable developments of the past year has been strength in the housing market. Going into the coronavirus, conditions were favorable due to low rates and low inventory. However, the pandemic resulted in rates moving even lower and a surge in demand as people were eager to move out of cities and into suburbs and rural areas. Of course, a contributing factor was the increase in remote work which gave people more flexibility in choosing a location.
As a result, it’s not surprising that the S&P CoreLogic Case-Schiller 20 City Home Price Index rose by 12% over the past 15 months to reach, new all-time highs. This is confirmed by anecdotal evidence as there are bidding wars for homes all across the country. This strength is also reflected in homebuilders, as the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) which is up more than 200% since the March 2020 stock market bottom. 
However, since early May, housing stocks have weakened as XHB is down about 12% since its high on May 10. While there are some indications that the housing market’s momentum is slowing, longer-term fundamentals remain supportive. Simply put, the housing market will continue to expand albeit at a slower pace than the prior year. Therefore, investors should use recent weakness as a buying opportunity and target high-quality stocks such as Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV), Tempur Sealy International (TPX), and Industrie Natuzzi (NTZ).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs are delaying plans for workers to return to U.K. offices after the government extended its COVID-19 restrictions until mid-July due to the rapid spread of the more infectious Delta variant.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which required most U.S. staff to return to offices this week, told U.K. staff on Tuesday that working at its London office will remain voluntary for now, according to a memo seen by Reuters. Social distancing and mask-wearing is required, while the broader return to office plans are postponed until July, the bank said.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is requiring the majority of U.S. staff to return next month, notified U.K.-based employees that its broad return-to-office plans are on hold until July, according a memo to its staff.
The investment banks had planned to bring more staff back to offices--on a rotational basis, subject to a 50% occupancy cap--on some of the quickest timelines. 
For both banks, roughly 20-30% of staff had been working in offices for several months, which allowed them to work out social distancing and health check protocols. 
But the U.K. said delaying full reopening until July 19 will allow it to get more people fully vaccinated. Currently, about 41 million people have received their first shot and nearly 30 million have had both doses - about 57% of the adult population.

The majority of Goldman Sachs employees have ""either had their first dose (of the vaccine) or expect to receive it before Monday, 21 June,"" Richard Gnodde, head of Goldman Sachs International, wrote in his memo to staff. 
Studies on Monday showed the Delta variant doubles the risk of hospitalization, but two doses of vaccines made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) offer more than 90% protection against hospitalization.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Markets were jostled Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve officials projected interest rate hikes sooner than expected, with stocks sliding and the dollar jumping on the news.
All three major U.S. indices fell following the afternoon announcement, as investors digested the possibility that interest rates could begin climbing sooner as Fed officials cited an improved economic outlook.
At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the Fed disclosed that 11 out of 18 officials were projecting at least two quarter-point interest rate increases in 2023, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell insisted at a press conference that the U.S. economy is well positioned coming out of the pandemic. The Fed said monetary support will remain until ""substantial further progress"" is seen on employment and inflation.
""The central case growth and inflation expectations for the next couple of years have not changed by much since March, but there is an explicit recognition that the vaccination program has reduced the risks to the economy from the health crisis,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.
Investors had been fixated on the new Fed statement all week, as it was the first policy update from the central bank since fresh economic data showed job growth slowing and inflation on the rise. New projections from Fed officials showed an uptick in projection inflation in the near term, but the Fed did not indicate any significant rethinking of its approach, said analysts.
""Clearly expectations for the Fed to flinch were grossly overblown—a unanimous vote clearly shows they’re all on the same page with the current state of the economy, and importantly they’ve essentially doubled down on their view that inflation is transitory, albeit at a higher rate than last time they met,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC). ""But what happens next year becomes more of a question mark.""
Markets dipped immediately following the statement, but recovered from session lows as investors digested the news. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 2.39 points or 0.33%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.66 points, or 0.77%, the S&P 500 lost 22.89 points, or 0.54%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.17 points, or 0.24%.
TREASURIES, DOLLAR SURGE
The prospect of higher rates was felt in Treasury bonds and the dollar, which both jumped following the Fed statement.
The benchmark 10-year yield rose to its highest level since June 4 at 1.594%. It was last up 7.5 basis points at 1.5737%. 
The five-year yield had its biggest one-day move since February, climbing to its highest level since April 6 at 0.913%.
The dollar index =USD, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.63% at 91.103, its highest since May 6.

Safe-haven gold prices took a hit on the Fed news, with spot gold falling 1.6% to $1,829.16 per ounce. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.3% at $1,861.40.
Oil prices posted gains for the fifth straight day on an anticipated surge in demand alongside falling crude inventories. Brent crude gained 40 cents, or 0.5%, to hit $74.39 a barrel, reaching its highest since April 2019, and running its gains to five straight days.

1314,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>","3 Overvalued Large-Cap Tech Stocks Wall Street Thinks Have Run Too Far, Too Fast","The increasing demand for tech products and services has lately been driving the prices of many large-cap tech stocks to fresh highs. However, rising production costs are expected to mar these companies’ revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Examples are Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Palantir (PLTR), and  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT). Their shares have rallied significantly to hit price levels that look unsustainable given the companies' moderate growth prospects. So, Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to lose some value in the near term. Let’s take a closer look at these names.
As businesses' rapid digitalization creates robust demand for tech products and solutions, the shares of many large-cap tech companies are soaring to new price highs. Continued demand for improved networking, data storage, and IoT devices in the coming 5G era, along with the adoption of hybrid work structures, have been driving the performance of major tech companies lately.
Investor optimism over the tech industry’s growth prospects is evident in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF’s (IYW) 9% returns over the past three months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 7.1% gains. However, production disruptions caused primarily by a global semiconductor chip shortage have reduced the sales and earnings of most companies in the industry. Against this backdrop, the momentum of many large-cap tech stocks looks unsustainable, making them susceptible to a pullback in the near term.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM), Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), and Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT) have hit price levels that are not justified by their growth potential. So, Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to retreat in the near term.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",GM escalates the electric vehicle arms race,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday boosted its spending on electric and autonomous vehicles, pulled ahead plans for two U.S. battery plants and forecast stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will now spend $35 billion through 2025 on EVs, an increase of 75% from March 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the industry.
Shares of GM were up 1.5% in late trading on Wednesday. 
GM's additional spending accelerates a global arms race among automakers and technology companies to expand electric vehicle offerings. Consulting firm AlixPartners on Wednesday said investments in electric vehicles by 2025 could total $330 billion, a 41% increase from the firm's comparable five-year investment outlook a year ago. 
""EV adoption is increasing and reaching an inflection point,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told reporters on a conference call. ""We want to be ready to be able to produce the capacity that we need to meet demand over time.""
The challenge for GM and other automakers will be that over the next several years demand from consumers and businesses for electric vehicles won't be on track to grow fast enough to sustain all the new entries to the market, AlixPartners warned in its forecast.
As of now, electric vehicles represent about 2% of total global vehicle sales, and will be about 24% of total sales by 2030, the consulting firm forecast. But EV sales would need to be 35% of total global sales by 2030 to absorb the expected increase in production. 
Electric vehicle investments are “well ahead of natural sales demand and neutral total cost of ownership or industry profitability,” AlixPartners cautioned in its annual outlook on the global auto industry released on Wednesday.
Automakers are pressing government officials in the United States, Europe and China to use public funds to offset the costs of shifting their fleets from piston engines to batteries, particularly the investments needed for charging infrastructure.
But forecasts for low profits and stranded capacity are not deterring companies from charging ahead in the race to catch electric vehicle industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the world's most valuable automaker. Demands from governments and investors to slash vehicle CO2 emissions, and the preference for EVs among many affluent and younger buyers, are driving the investment boom.
GM previously said it would introduce 30 new EVs globally by 2025, and on Wednesday it said that number will now rise with the higher spending, including additional electric commercial trucks. It also said additional U.S. plant capacity would be used to build electric SUVs. Specifics of the new vehicle numbers and SUV plants involved were not detailed.
As part of the spending, GM said it will build two additional U.S. battery plants by mid-decade, joining plants in northeast Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM said details on where those plants will be built will be announced later, but those plants will account for more than half of the latest $8 billion increase in spending.
This marks the second time the Detroit carmaker has increased its EV budget since outlining its goals early last year. In November, the budget increased to $27 billion from $20 billion.
Reuters reported the increased spending plans on Tuesday. 
GM's announcement comes less than a month after rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co upped its EV spending by more than a third to over $30 billion by 2030.
In January, GM set a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. 
GM also said it now expects to report better-than-expected results in the second quarter despite the impact of the global chip shortage. It now expects first-half operating earnings will be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion due to strong GM Financial results and improved vehicle production as it pulls forward chip supplies from the third quarter. GM previously said it would significantly beat its previous forecast for a first-half profit of $5.5 billion.
GM further said it will launch a third generation of its Hydrotec hydrogen fuel-cell systems with greater power density and lower costs by mid-decade.

Reuters also reported GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with key U.S. lawmakers to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions. 
(This story corrects paragraph 4 to say AlixPartners forecasts $330 billion in electric vehicle investment by 2025 instead of 2030)

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended in the red Wednesday after the Federal Reserve penciled in two interest rates hikes by the end of 2023 amid expectations for stronger growth and inflation.     
The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.77%, or 265 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.24%.
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates and monthly bond buying steady, though it signaled that it could hike rates sooner than previously expected.
The Fed hiked its interest-rate outlook in 2023 to 0.6% from previous projections of 0.1% in March, signaling two 0.25% rate hikes, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed. The move suggests the central bank is starting to take the pace of inflation more seriously. 
""[A] majority of meeting participants now expect higher key rates as early as 2023, suggesting that the Fed is accelerating its policy normalization timetable under the impression of rising price risks,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
In the press conference that followed, however, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell attempted to downplay the hawkish outlook on rates.
""The projections are individual projections and not a committee forecast ... they're not a plan,"" Powell said. ""Discussing liftoff now would be highly premature.""
Treasury yields jumped sharply on the news as investors sold bonds on expectations of rising rates. 
Growth sectors of the market like tech, which typically boasts higher valuation that are unattractive in a rising rate environment, pared some of their post-Fed losses, but ultimately ended lower.     
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended the day mixed. 
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, fell 6% after its softer second-quarter guidance offset first-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Cyclicals, which tend to move in tandem with an improving economy, were also lower, though financials were higher as bank stocks were boosted by rising rates.  
Energy stocks were lower as oil prices pared some of their recent gains, though remained close to October 2018 highs, as weekly U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected.
Crude oil inventories fell 7.355 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 3.29 million barrels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Credit Suisse Group has named a trio of dealmakers to run its global mergers and acquisitions practice, in a leadership reshuffle after the previous chief's departure from Switzerland's second largest bank.
The changes follow a wave of investment bankers leaving the bank after bonuses were cut to tackle losses of more than $5 billion from the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos and British supply chain financier Greensill Capital.
David Wah has been elevated to global head of advisory, effective immediately, according to a memo seen by Reuters. A bank spokesperson confirmed the contents on Wednesday.
Wah will continue to head  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s client advisory group, a team of senior bankers formed during the coronavirus pandemic to focus on the bank's best clients.
Cathal Deasy and Steven Geller have been promoted to global co-heads of the mergers and acquisitions practice. London-based Deasy was previously head of dealmaking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while Geller ran M&A in the Americas and globally within the bank's technology-focused unit.
The deals the two have worked on include the combination of DuPont (NYSE:DD)'s nutrition and bioscience business with IFF , and the acquisition by FIS of rival Worldpay, the memo added. 

The changes come after veteran Credit Suisse dealmaker Greg Weinberger, who had led the bank's global M&A franchise, departed for  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. 
In recent weeks, several of Credit Suisse's most senior dealmakers advising other financial institutions (FIG) on mergers and other strategic matters have left, including Alejandro Przygoda, the global head of FIG.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co is looking at signing longer-term supply contracts or partnering with chip and wafer suppliers in the future to mitigate the impact it has seen from the global semiconductor shortage, the automaker's chief financial officer said on Wednesday.
""Whether we work with foundries to give longer-term commitments or we look to partnering with folks, we're looking at all aspects of the supply chain to really ensure that something of this magnitude as it relates to chips doesn't happen again,"" Paul Jacobson said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference.
The global chip shortage has forced GM and other automakers to idle plants, but the Detroit company has been able to largely protect output of its highest-profit models. GM has said the shortage could shave $1.5 billion to $2 billion from this year's profit, but recently restarted production at some plants that had been idled.
The shortage will cost global automakers $110 billion in lost revenues this year, and cut production by 3.9 million vehicles, consulting firm AlixPartners has said.
While GM expects the situation to improve in the second half, issues like the COVID outbreak in Malaysia are still hitting the chip industry, Jacobson said. 
""As long as that continues, we're losing some production there from some key chip providers,"" he said. ""It's things like that that really make this a week-to-week phenomenon."" He added GM has resorted to using air freight to ship chips.
Nevertheless, Jacobson said consumer demand for vehicles remains strong, which should continue into the fourth quarter at least. He added that lean vehicle inventories will last well into 2022 if demand remains high and chip supplies remain tight.
The chip shortage has led automakers to rethink how their supply chain works when it comes to critical parts like chips. 

Germany's Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it is talking with chip makers about securing supplies over the long term, and one unnamed executive previously told Reuters the automaker is weighing buying directly from the manufacturers rather than working through others.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Chief Executive Jim Farley said last month the No. 2 U.S. automaker is redesigning parts to use more accessible chips and weighing other strategies, including building a buffer supply of chips or working directly with the foundries that make the wafers used in semiconductors.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled after the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision, which held steady but pointed to rate hikes down the road. They later recovered some of their lost ground.
Cyclical stocks, which tend to move in tandem with an improving economy, were also lower, though financials pared their losses as bank stocks rose. Financial firms can make more money when rates rise.  
The Fed’s announcement on Wednesday sent a jolt of electricity through a market that had been waffling in recent days. Another factor could have been the conclusion of a summit meeting between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Biden told reporters in Switzerland after the meeting that he told Putin “we need to have some basic rules of the road,” including infrastructure that should be off limits to cyberattacks, adding he called on Putin to respect human rights. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Fed effects
Markets reacted negatively on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates and monthly bond buying steady, though it signaled that two rate hikes could be in the cards by the end of 2023. Investor wariness could continue into Thursday, but markets have proven themselves to be resilient before even the face of seemingly contrary news. 
2. Unemployment claims
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he expected to see strong job creation over the summer months. On Thursday, we get weekly data that could support that view. Continuing jobless claims, a measure of people receiving unemployment benefits for a while, are expected to fall to 3.430 million in the week ending June 12, from 3.499 million a week before.
The number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in the U.S. is seen falling to 359,000 for the week ending June 5, the fewest since the pandemic began and beating 376,000 for the week before. Both numbers are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Kroger earnings
Consumers have noted rising prices for food and other basic household items. At the same time, retailers have grappled with rising wages and worker shortages. One big food retailer -- Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) -- reports earnings for the most recent period tomorrow. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect first-quarter EPS of 98 cents on revenue of $39.56 billion.

The e-commerce industry is expected to generate sustainable growth this year, with many organizations and individuals continuing with remote arrangements. Thus, Wall Street analysts predict e-commerce stocks  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) will rally in the coming months. So, let’s evaluate these names.E-commerce businesses thrived last year as consumer behavior changed drastically in response to lockdowns and social distancing restrictions. Most brick-and-mortar businesses adapted to changing shopping preferences by launching online platforms to facilitate remote purchases. The benefits of online shopping contributed to high e-commerce sales in the first quarter ended March 31. E-commerce sales in the United States increased 39% year-over-year to $196.66 billion in the quarter. Online sales accounted for 19.5% of total retail sales in the most recent quarter, up 360 basis points from the same period last year.
While brick-and-mortar sales have been accelerating lately on pent-up demand for physical shopping, e-commerce shopping is likely to stick as a habit as people gradually adjust to partially remote lifestyles. Statista projects U.S. e-commerce sales will witness a steady upward trajectory over the next four years to hit $563.4 billion by 2025.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts expect the e-commerce industry to generate sustainable growth in 2021, driving up the share prices of established companies Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), JD.com, Inc. (JD),  Stamps.com Inc . (STMP) by more than 40%.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 03:21PM ET</span>","U.S. push for self-driving cars faces union, lawyers opposition","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday again rejected attempts to lift regulations to allow for the deployment of thousands of autonomous vehicles as union groups and attorneys campaign against the legislative proposal.
The committee rebuffed the bid by Republican Senator John Thune to attach measures lifting regulations on autonomous vehicles to a $78 billion surface transportation bill after he sought last month to attach it in May to a bill on China tech policy.
Thune has proposed granting the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to grant exemptions for tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind.
The surface bill, which would boost funding for Amtrak and other transportation needs, was approved by the committee on a 25-3 vote.
Thune and other lawmakers have sought for nearly five years to win approval.
The senator argued autonomous vehicles could help eliminate numerous deaths due to human error like distracted or impaired drivers.
Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, cited recent Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) crashes and other recent incidents involving driver assistance systems in her response.
""It seems like every other week we're hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot"" Cantwell said. ""I do think this is legislation that we can complete by the end of this year... These last issues are very thorny as it relates to legal structure."" 
""Democrats have yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people,"" Thune said. ""Are we really going to continue to ignore the enormous safety benefits of these vehicles?""
Thune said that the ""Teamsters and trial lawyers"" are opposed to self-driving legislation and they ""seem to own lock, stock and barrel the Democrats on this committee.""
The Teamsters did not immediately comment. The American Association for Justice, which represents plaintiffs lawyers said it ""will continue to oppose any legislation that exempts the driverless car industry from basic safety standards, and allows auto and tech companies to avoid being held accountable through the use of forced arbitration clauses.""
The Self-Driving Coalition, which represents Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo, Volvo Cars and others said ""the exclusion of AV legislation from current surface transportation reauthorization bills reflects yet another missed opportunity to save lives"" but it vowed to work with lawmakers.

Last month, Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department for the AFL-CIO, told U.S. lawmakers that autonomous vehicles place ""millions of jobs at risk"" and any self-driving legislation should not apply to commercial trucks.
Reuters reported in May that Waymo and rival Cruise, a unit of General Motors (NYSE:GM), have applied for permits to start charging for rides and delivery using autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 03:12PM ET</span>",Google must face shareholder lawsuit claiming it hid security risks,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit in which shareholders of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc accused the company of fraudulently concealing security vulnerabilities, including in its Google+ social network.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the lawsuit raised a ""strong inference"" that Alphabet's then-Chief Executive Larry Page and his successor, Sundar Pichai, knew about the bugs and an internal memo on security issues but intentionally concealed the information from investors.
Alphabet and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the 3-0 decision.
The lawsuit, led by the state of Rhode Island, followed an October 2018 Wall Street Journal article that said Google concealed the exposure of private data for nearly 500,000 Google+ users because it feared regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
Alphabet's share price fell more than 6% over the following three days, reducing the Mountain View, California-based company's market value by more than $50 billion.
Google ultimately admitted it had discovered the data exposure in March 2018, though there was no evidence of misuse, and decided to shut down the consumer version of Google+.
Its failure to disclose the vulnerabilities sooner drew bipartisan condemnation from Congress.
In Wednesday's decision, Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta accepted the shareholders' argument that Alphabet stayed silent to ""buy time,"" and avoid the spotlight that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was then under because Britain's Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from tens of millions of its users.
""As it turned out, Alphabet successfully bought itself about six months of time,"" Ikuta wrote. ""The competing inference that Alphabet knew of this information but was merely negligent in not disclosing it is not plausible.""
The case was returned to U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco, who had dismissed it in February 2020.

""We are grateful to have the opportunity to sit down with Mr. Pichai, Mr. Page and others to get the bottom of what they did,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer Jason Forge said in an interview.
The case is In re Alphabet Inc Securities Litigation, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-15638.

So, based on that, we think it could be wise to invest now in low-priced tech names Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Sharp (OTC:SHCAY), which possess strong financials.The ongoing economic recovery and fears over rising inflation caused investors to rotate away from expensive tech stocks to quality cyclical stocks earlier this year. However, the sector is well positioned for solid growth because businesses are increasingly adopting advanced technologies to stay competitive in the digital era. Furthermore, because hybrid working arrangements are expected to persist for the foreseeable future, demand for cloud computing, 5G, and other advanced technologies should continue increasing. Indeed, the industry is expected to hit a $5 trillion market value by year’s end.
Given the industry’s solid growth prospects, investors are gradually returning to tech stocks. This is evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 6.3% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 2.3% gains.
Given this backdrop, we think it wise to bet on Nokia Corporation (NOK) and Sharp Corporation (SHCAY). They are currently trading at less than $10 but hold immense upside potential.

""While our technology issues from Tuesday have been resolved, we are still experiencing a small number of cancellations and delays across our network as we continue working to resume normal operations,"" airline spokesman Dan Landson said.
Tuesday's groundstop lasted about 45 minutes, and ended at 2:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday (1830 GMT), the FAA said.
FlightAware.com, a flight tracking website said Southwest had canceled 315 flights Wednesday through 2 p.m. EDT, or 8% of those scheduled, and delayed a further 562.
Southwest said it had canceled about 500 flights Tuesday and delayed hundreds of others after the stoppage, which it said was the result of ""intermittent performance issues with our network connectivity.""
Southwest delayed nearly 1,300 flights on Tuesday, or 37% of its flights.

Earlier Southwest reported a separate issue that required a groundstop Monday after its ""third-party weather data provider experienced intermittent performance issues ... preventing transmission of weather information that is required to safely operate our aircraft.""
The airline said that issue affected several hundred flights and was resolved after 11 p.m. CDT Monday.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo said on Wednesday it raised $2.5 billion in its first fresh funding round in a year, after a string of defections of executives rekindled concerns about the technology struggling to scale up. 
The announcement came a day after General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co’s majority-owned Cruise self-driving car subsidiary said it would gain access to a $5-billion credit line.
Self-driving startups are racing to build war chests to develop and commercialize technology, an expensive and time-consuming process. 
The funding led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other existing shareholders is the second outside funding for Waymo, which last year raised $3.25 billion in its first external investment round since its inception 2009. 
Waymo has been widely viewed as the leader of the self-driving race, but attaining the holy grail of full and safe automation remains challenging as it faces growing competition from rivals backed by legacy automakers. 
“There’s no greater challenge in artificial intelligence than building and deploying fully autonomous technology at scale,"" Dmitri Dolgov and Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo’s co-CEOs, said in a statement. 
The duo became co-CEOs after John Krafcik stepped down in April, followed by departures of the chief financial officer and other senior officials. [nL4N2MZ4G4]
Waymo, which offers driverless rides hailing service in limited areas in Phoenix, has this year applied for permit for commercial deployment in San Francisco. 
It has also expanded into the trucking segment, testing goods transport services using autonomous trucks.
""Self-driving startups are unlikely to be anywhere near profitable for many years to come. They need to raise the capital, in order to fund that expansion into the operational side,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, Principal Research Analyst at Guidehouse Insights. 
IPOS for self-driving startups would be an opportunity for investors to recoup their losses, he said. 
Self-driving startup Argo AI, backed by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), plans to have another funding round before pursuing a public listing next year. 
Waymo said the capital would be used for advancing Waymo Driver, the company's autonomous driving technology, and to grow Waymo's team, the company said. (https:// According to investor website PitchBook, Waymo, is valued at just over $30 billion. Alphabet did not immediately comment on the unit's latest valuation.  Participants in this latest round include AutoNation (NYSE:AN),  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company, as well as new investor Tiger Global.  
""The latest Waymo funding round clearly demonstrates that there is a healthy investor appetite for self-driving technologies,"" said Grayson Brulte, president at consultancy Brulte & Co. ""I do think investors are getting more confident after the successful TuSimple IPO,"" he said.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Big Tech in focus next week as U.S. House panel votes on new bills,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House Judiciary Committee will vote next week on a package of recently introduced antitrust bills including several targeting the market power of Big Tech, committee chair Jerry Nadler said on Wednesday.
Five antitrust bills were introduced last week in the House of Representatives. They will be marked up in committee to consider changes and then voted on by the panel to decide whether the full House should vote on the measures. 
Two of the bills introduced last week address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
These bills -- one of which would force companies to sell businesses -- have attracted the most opposition. Some pro-tech groups have said they could mean the end of popular promotions like Amazon Prime free shipping and iMessage in iPhones.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, talked about a crisis given the power of Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google. ""These modern day robber barons are growing their power from anti-competitive means,"" he said at a press conference flanked by Republican and Democratic colleagues.
A top antitrust Republican, Representative Ken Buck, said he had been skeptical of the need for additional antitrust enforcement but had changed his mind. ""I think you're going to see more Republican support as folks understand the issue more,"" he said.

In addition to the two bills aimed at conflict of interest in platforms' businesses, a third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in. A fourth would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere, including to a competing business.
The House members also introduced a fifth bill, a companion to a measure that has already passed the Senate and would increase the budgets of antitrust enforcers and make companies planning the biggest mergers pay more. Observers have said that this bill was the most likely of the five to become law.

However, given the increased volatility of meme stocks, investors are increasingly unsure how long their momentum could last. As such, we think it’s best to bet on names that possess strong financials and business models to help sustain their rallies. So, with that in mind, let’s evaluate which of these two stocks is a better buy now.As the Reddit-fueled meme stock mania intensifies, it seems that retail traders have now shifted their focus from AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) to several new names that include Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV) and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN). The price of healthcare company CLOV’s stock jumped a staggering 109% on June 8 as amateur traders on social media platforms continued to drive rallies in heavily shorted U.S. stocks. Similarly, WEN’s shares surged nearly 26% to record highs on the same day after subreddit r/wallstreetbets forum’s post pitched the fast-food-joint as “the perfect stock” because of its signature products and “effective” social media presence.
However, CLOV’s shares have crashed into negative territory. The stock has lost 37.8% over the past five days. This reflects that the gains were not a result of financial performance and fundamentals, but merely social media attention. In contrast, WEN has been witnessing strong digital and store sales, and increasing demand for its premium food items. Since the company is both fundamentally and financially sound, it could continue to see solid gains going forward.
While CLOV has gained 84.3% over the past month, WEN has returned 1.4%. In terms of past three months’ performance, CLOV is the clear winner with 55.2% gains versus WEN’s 10.2% returns. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Telekom seeks investors to bankroll German internet overhaul - sources,"By Arno Schuetze, Nadine Schimroszik and Pamela Barbaglia
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) is offering investors stakes in a company it is creating to overhaul Germany's internet cables to help foot the bill for much-needed network modernisation, three people familiar with the matter said.
The deal is part of a German bid to catch up with other European countries such as Spain, which has outpaced Europe's industrial powerhouse by laying high-tech glass fibre cables while Germany is mainly stuck with old-fashioned copper lines.
Deutsche Telekom, Germany's main telecoms company, has come under increasing pressure to act quickly as the coronavirus pandemic has forced more people to work from home and rely on fast, stable internet connections.
The sources told Reuters that Deutsche Telecom and its adviser  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are targeting investors such as Dutch funds APG and PGGM and Canada's Brookfield and CDPQ, as well as sovereign wealth funds.
Deutsche Telekom's initial plan is to roll out fibre cables to 4 million households and investors will be offered stakes equivalent to up to half of the project's equity, the sources said. Further extensions of the network are likely.
The German company is following the strategy adopted by rivals, such as Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), which have struck similar deals with investors to help pay for network upgrades.
Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bank and the prospective bidders all declined to comment.
At the same time, the German telecoms giant is kicking off the sale of its T-Mobile Netherlands business to cut its debt and free up cash for investment in infrastructure.
FOREIGN INVESTORS
Deutsche Telekom is a laggard when it comes to fibre as it bet on improved copper cables to supply internet connections and only switched to focusing on faster fibre cables in 2019.
Its move is part of a trend among German companies of turning to foreign investors to fund parts of the infrastructure that keeps the wheels of industry whirring, such as energy.
Power network 50Hertz, for example, is now majority owned by Belgium's Elia while gas-power firm Open Grid Europe is part-owned by Australian investor Macquarie. 
Investment by China, however, is viewed sceptically. When China's State Grid wanted to take a stake in 50Hertz in 2018, German state lender KfW prevented the move.
Fibre networks are typically financed with 30% equity and 70% debt and Deutsche Telekom is looking for investors to contribute half of the equity with it providing the rest.
Telefonica struck a deal in October 2020 with German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) to develop a fibre optic network in Germany for 2.2 million households in a project valued at 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion).
Assuming a similar valuation, Deutsche Telekom's project to supply about 4 million households would be worth some 10 billion euros, meaning investors would need to contribute 1.5 billion euros, or half of the 30% equity.
At its capital markets day in May, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges underlined the company's commitment to accelerating the rollout of fibre in Germany, taking it from 600,000 households last year to 2.5 million in 2024.
He said the company plans to invest 2.5 billion euros a year in fibre infrastructure.
DUTCH MOBILE SALE
Deutsche Telekom's plan would still leave it trailing countries such as Spain and Sweden, where more than 60% of homes already get their internet via fibre cables. In Germany, only 5% of homes have fibre, slightly lower than Italy.
Deutsche Telekom executive Dominique Leroy has said its goal is to reach 10 million households with fibre by the end of 2024 and that it would seek partnerships where it makes sense.
While Deutsche Telekom is preparing to invest billions, it is also faces a large bill to exercise options to raise its holding in T-Mobile U.S. to more than 50% from 43%.
However, it is already saddled with 130 billion euros of debt and is now selling businesses to reduce the pile.
First in line is its subsidiary T-Mobile Netherlands, which is estimated to be worth up to 5 billion euros. The Dutch mobile business has 6.8 million customers and its sales last year came to 1.9 billion euros. 
Deutsche Telekom's adviser on the deal,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), has sent out first information packs to prospective bidders asking for offers by the end of July, people familiar with the process said.
Suitors including buyout groups KKR, EQT (NYSE:EQT) and Warburg Pincus are expected to take part, as is French telecoms entrepreneur Xavier Niel, the people said. 
Warburg Pincus, which employs former Deutsche Telekom CEO Rene Obermann, came close to buying the business in 2015. 
Morgan Stanley and the potential bidders all declined to comment.

Once that sale is out of the way, Deutsche Telekom may look to sell its telecom towers division, the people said, adding that while conversations with banks are taking place no decision has been taken.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) said on Wednesday the number of drivers on its U.S. ride-hail platform was gradually increasing, resulting in reduced wait times for customers and a modest decrease in surcharge pricing as travel rebounds from pandemic lows.
Lyft said active drivers on its platform had increased 10% since the beginning of May, adding that thousands of new drivers were activated over just the past two weeks.
In data provided to Reuters exclusively, the company said passenger wait times across the United States were down around 15% on average compared with one month ago. Wait times in some major markets, including Austin, Texas; Miami and Philadelphia, were 25% to 30% shorter and down as much as 35% in Las Vegas.
Serving the rebound in travel demand is crucial for Lyft, which has promised investors it will be profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of the third quarter in September. Longer wait times mean a loss of potential customers and lower revenue.
Lyft declined to provide absolute figures for driver numbers and wait times. The company also warned that wait times and prices may continue to fluctuate as the rebound from the pandemic continues.
Lyft and its larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc have been scrambling in recent months to bring back drivers to their platforms to serve a sudden uptick in rider demand as more Americans are vaccinated against COVID-19 and resume pre-pandemic travel.
Uber and Lyft are trying to lure drivers back with additional incentives and the promise of temporarily higher earnings.

The undersupply of drivers has led to a sharp increase in prices and long wait times in many U.S. cities, causing many ride-hail customers to vent their frustrations online.
Lyft said on Wednesday that surcharge fares during peak demand - a measure the company calls Prime Time pricing - had declined 15% during the last week of May compared with the last week of March.

LONDON (Reuters) - A COVID-19 antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) and Roche reduced deaths in hospitalised patients whose own immune systems had failed to produce a response, a large British study found on Wednesday.
The therapy, REGEN-COV, has been granted emergency use authorisation for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in the United States, but results from the RECOVERY trial provide the clearest evidence of its effectiveness among hospitalised patients.
It found that the antibody therapy reduced by a fifth the 28-day mortality of people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 whose immune system had not mounted an antibody response, known as seronegative.
The result translates into six fewer deaths for every 100 seronegative patients treated with the therapy, researchers said.
There was no discernible effect of the treatment on those who had generated natural antibody responses.
""People have been very, very sceptical, that any treatment against this particular virus would work by the time people get in hospital,"" Martin Landray, the joint chief investigator on the trial, told reporters.
""If you haven't raised antibodies of your own, you really would benefit from getting some,"" he said.
The treatment also shortened the hospital stay of those who were seronegative and reduced their chances of needing a mechanical ventilator, Landray said. 
Regeneron had previously said its treatment had shown enough promise in hospitalised patients to warrant continuing its trial. This data provides the first large-scale confirmation of that assertion.
There were 9,785 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus the antibody combination therapy or just usual care, of which 30% were seronegative.
The RECOVERY trial also showed the steroid dexamethasone and Roche's arthritis drug Actemra (tocilizumab) cut deaths in hospitalised patients.
While those treatments focus on inflammation caused by reaction to the coronavirus, Regeneron's therapy, which belongs to a class of biotech drugs called monoclonal antibodies, mimic natural antibodies the body produces to fight off the infection.
""This is the first time we've got one that's actually targeting the virus itself,"" Landray said, adding that it could be used along with the other treatments.
""It's not that you do one thing or another thing. These benefits are additive in these patients,"" he said.
POSSIBILITY FOR OTHERS
Other companies have been developing similar treatments.
U.S. emergency use authorization has been granted to antibody treatments developed by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co as well as by Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) Inc with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc. Both are approved for use in mild-to-moderate cases.
On Tuesday, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its antibody therapy had shown no evidence of protecting people from developing the disease following exposure, although other trials of its cocktail as a prevention or a treatment are ongoing.
Landray said the RECOVERY results should give developers of other monoclonal antibody therapies optimism that they can also be used in some hospitalised patients.
""This opens up the possibility for many, many others,"" he said.
""People see a few negative trials and they say 'well that'll never work' and they opt out and go off and do something else. (But) this is very, very clear, the picture that we've got from this trial.""
Regeneron has enlisted Swiss pharmaceutical Roche to help manufacture the drug. 
Some cautioned that the full cost-benefit of the drug would not be clear until more details of the study were available.

""The absolute magnitude of benefit in mortality is not large, and it means that a large (possibly 20) number of people have to be treated with the extremely expensive drug for a single death to be prevented,"" said Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
""If (patients) can be readily identified and treated it will have some benefit in practice, but its benefits should not be overstated.""

(Reuters) -  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group said on Wednesday it would delay the launch of its new cruise liner by nearly a month after eight crew members tested positive for COVID-19, the latest setback in its push to restart the much-awaited U.S. summer trips.
Odyssey of the Seas, which was scheduled to sail through the Southern and Western Caribbean from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, will now set sail on July 31 instead of July 3. A simulation cruise, originally set for late June, will also be rescheduled.
Cruise companies have been cleared in the United States to sail under strict conditions, giving them a much needed respite after being hammered by the pandemic, although a spate of COVID-19 cases onboard are roiling their schedule.
Earlier this month, the company said two people tested positive for COVID-19 onboard Celebrity Millennium, which was among the first cruises in North America to start sailing.
On the latest cases, Royal Caribbean said six of Odyssey's eight crew members who tested positive were asymptomatic and two had mild symptoms. 
The positive cases were traced following the crew's inoculation but before the effectiveness of the vaccine kicked in, the company said. All 1,400 crew members were vaccinated on June 4 and will be considered fully vaccinated on June 18, it added.
Royal Caribbean International, which has eight trips scheduled from U.S. ports, had previously planned the voyage of its brand new ship through Israel, Greece and Cyprus but the route was later altered on security grounds. 
Royal Caribbean, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise have all been cleared to set sail again after meeting regulatory guidelines, including a fully vaccinated crew. 
Shares of the three companies were up more than 2% each following an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which is expecting a recovery in the industry based on improved bookings and pricing trends out of North America over the past month.

Investing.com –  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares fell by more than 4% in Wednesday’s trade after the financial services giant’s finance chief warned of rising costs even as revenue growth in various verticals slows.
Expenses in the second quarter will likely jump to “somewhere in the middle” of a range of $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion, Bloomberg quoted its Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason as telling investors at a virtual conference Tuesday. That compares with costs of $10.4 billion a year earlier.
Companies in the U.S. are facing higher wage costs amid a rising inflation in prices of raw materials and other input costs. At the same time, consumer spending is now slowing as people have spent their stimulus checks and states end their Covid-19 supports. 
Mason also warned many of its biggest businesses would suffer from a drop in revenue in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg. He signaled revenue from the bank’s trading operations will probably fall by about 30% from a year ago.
He said strength in equities would be countered by weakness in its sprawling fixed-income franchise.
The firm’s U.S. consumer business has also been beset by slowing loan growth as credit-card holders pay back their loans at faster rates. Revenue in the unit is likely to fall by around 15%, Mason said, as per Bloomberg.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it had removed a network of fake accounts in Ethiopia targeting domestic users ahead of next week's elections, which it linked to individuals associated with the country's Information Network Security Agency.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said the network posted mainly in Amharic about news and current events, including about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his Prosperity Party. It said the network posted critical commentary about opposition politicians and groups including the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People's Liberation Front among others. 
The head of INSA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The agency, which was set up years before Abiy came to power, is responsible for monitoring telecommunications and the internet. 
""INSA is under the ministry of peace and an independent institution - you can address your question there,"" Billene Seyoum, the prime minister's spokeswoman, told Reuters when asked about Facebook's action.
Facebook said the network of accounts, groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram had violated its rules against ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" and had accelerated its posting in 2020 and into 2021. It said the network had recently commented on U.S. sanctions on Ethiopia.
The June 21 vote is the first time Abiy will face voters at the ballot box in Africa's second most populous nation. Just over a fifth of parliamentary constituencies are not voting due to logistical problems, low-level violence or due to the war in the northern region of Tigray.

Facebook said the network's activity on its platforms was not directly focused on the Tigray region or the ongoing conflict in Tigray.
Facebook said about 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the network's pages and about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups. It also said the network had spent about $6,200 in ads on the platforms, paid for in U.S. dollars.

The rest are expected to follow soon, the sources said, adding that remedial action taken by the banks could include staff training courses that would help avoid price fixing.

Having been forced to book billions of dollars of losses earlier this year due to exposures to collapsed investment firm Archegos Capital Management and defunct British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital, Credit Suisse has seen a subsequent wave of investment bankers leave, amid concerns about pay packets and future job prospects.
Weinberger, who was global head of mergers and acquisitions for Credit Suisse, becomes the latest departure. He will join Morgan Stanley, where he will boost the bank's dealmaking practice including in energy, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.
Among Weinberger's clients is  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), which he advised on a number of matters included its pursuit of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) in 2019. While losing out to Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), Chevron came out of the episode in good standing, having pocketed a $1 billion break-up fee after Anadarko terminated its previously agreed deal, while Oxy remains weighed down by debt taken on to fund its $38 billion purchase.
Spokespeople for Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley declined comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the Weinberger news.
Switzerland's second-largest bank is struggling to retain staff after trimming bonuses to tackle the Archegos and Greensill losses.

Last month, Alejandro Przygoda, who was Credit Suisse's global head of its financial institutions group (FIG), left with three other bankers to join Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
At the start of this month, Reuters reported that Armando Rubio-Alvarez, who headed the Swiss bank's FIG franchise in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was also moving to Jefferies.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazil's biggest exporters, including Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) and Suzano SA, are demanding 19 billion reais ($3.77 billion) from a series of foreign and domestic banks in a lawsuit accusing them of manipulating foreign exchange rates, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters.
Exporters' association AEB, which had initially filed the lawsuit in 2018 without specifying damages, said Brazilian exporters suffered 107.4 billion reais in losses from banks' alleged manipulation of currencies between 2010 and 2011. AEB's compensation calculations took into consideration that the association represents 20% of Brazilian exporters.
Among the banks named in the lawsuit are Itau Unibanco Holding SA,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, HSBC (whose Brazilian unit was acquired by Banco Bradesco SA in 2016),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Citi said its conduct complies with rules. Bradesco declined to comment. Santander said it is still unaware of the class action, while Itau said it will contest the accusations. Other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
AEB has not yet been able to make calculations for the period between 2008 and 2012, the full period it believes a cartel to manipulate exchange rates was in place, AEB's lawyer Bruno Maggi said.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA made similar allegations of manipulation in a lawsuit filed in April separately from AEB's, which represents 50 companies. 
Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade is also investigating potential currency manipulation by banks.
The compensation demanded by Brazilian exporters is the latest development in a global foreign exchange scandal, which has led to billions of dollars in penalties for banks worldwide. Allegations of widespread manipulation in the spot foreign exchange market were first reported in 2013.

Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico first reported this class action on Tuesday.

Furthermore, President Biden’s proposed infrastructure plan to rebuild and reshape U.S. infrastructure and its economy is expected to provide a solid boost to the sector. Consequently, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound companies that service the sector, such as  Caterpillar  (CAT), Cummins (CMI), and  Nucor  (NUE) before Biden’s bill is passed. Read on.Infrastructure activities came to a near standstill last year due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. The sector is now witnessing a solid recovery with the reopening of the economy and the easing of restrictions thanks to a robust mass vaccination drive. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, construction spending increased 5.8% year-over-year to $452.3 billion during the first four months of this year.
While Biden’s much discussed infrastructure bill has yet to be passed, the White House and Senate Republicans appear to be inching closer to a deal. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on June 15 that he hoped to have a July vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill. With the urgent need to upgrade traditional infrastructure in the U.S., such as roads, bridges and ports, the bill should drive significant growth in the infrastructure industry. Investors’ interest in this space is evidenced by iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF’s (IFRA) 23.8% returns over the past six months compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 15.7% gains.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally sound companies Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT),  Cummins Inc . (NYSE:CMI), and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) ahead of the passage of the infrastructure bill.

Rimac has developed an electric supercar platform which it supplies to other carmakers, including Automobili Pininfarina.
It is currently working on a strategic partnership with Volkswagen unit Bugatti, which will likely result in a joint venture between Porsche and Rimac, with Porsche as a minority partner, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said in March.
""The future of Bugatti is an issue that will be decided on a group level,"" Porsche said in a statement, declining to comment further.

So, given the company’s operational challenges, coupled with its higher valuation and weak profit margin, would it be wise to buy the dip in LTHM? Read more to find out.Incorporated in 2018, Livent Corporation (LTHM) is a manufacturer and seller of performance lithium compounds mainly used in lithium-based batteries, specialty polymers, and chemical synthesis applications. Because governments around the world are focused on increasing the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce carbon emissions, the demand for lithium, which is a key component for EV batteries, is surging. This positive backdrop has helped LTHM gain 138.3% over the past year.
However, LTHM's stock has lost 2.6% so far this year and is currently trading 26.3% below its all-time high of $23.99, which it hit on January 20.

In fact, LTHM’s current valuation is not justified given the company’s high losses and expenses. Consequently, we think LTHM’s stock price could suffer a further pullback in the near term.

(Reuters) -The first bond backing the EU's COVID-19 recovery fund rallied strongly a day after issuance on Wednesday, while euro area and U.S. government bond yields dipped as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision.
The European Union raised 20 billion euros ($24 billion) from a 10-year bond on Tuesday in the largest-ever single-tranche institutional debt sale that saw near-record demand of 142 billion euros, taking a big step towards establishing itself as a major debt issuer.. 
The bond rallied sharply in the secondary market in further evidence of strong demand, with its yield - 0.086% at pricing - down 5 basis points to around 0.04% on Wednesday. 
The rally was similar to that following the EU's first issuance last October backing the SURE unemployment scheme, a smaller support programme. 
With demand far above the deal size, much investor appetite was left unsatisfied, bankers involved with the deal said. 
""Given the particularly low (investor) allocations compared to normal, you're going to get more follow-on demand than you would typically see,"" one of the bankers said.
It attracted such large demand at issuance even though the EU capped orders it considered from hedge funds, which, inflating their demand to secure better allocations, have been a major driver of large bond sale order books.
Investors were keen to buy the first issuance of what will become a much more liquid funding programme than SURE, the bankers said.
The European Central Bank upholding accelerated bond purchases for the third quarter has also given investors confidence to buy into sizable debt sales.
In the broader market, bond yields dipped as the focus was on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
The benchmark 10-year yield was last half a basis point at 1.4939% while investors waited for signs that the policies put into place last year to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, including a massive bond-buying programme, may be altered. 
Fed officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks on tapering its bond purchases, while attention will also be on new interest rate and economic projections to show how much policymakers' views have changed since March. 
Germany's 10-year yield, the euro area benchmark, was down slightly over one basis point to -0.243%, along with most other 10-year yields.
In recent weeks, bond yields, which have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic - closely correlated - have shrugged off a spike in U.S. inflation. 
""U.S. yields will probably be the main driver of direction of European yields over the coming three months and I think the Fed rhetoric on tapering and where their inflation targets are will be of interest,"" said Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). 

In the primary market, Germany raised 4.085 billion euros from the auction of a new 10-year bond.

Investing.com --   Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) rose 0.6% as Canaccord initiated it with a buy and calling it the ""on-ramp"" to cryptocurrency.
Analyst Joseph Vafi set a price target of $285. Shares are trading a hair under $234 today.
""While the short term is less clear, the long-term investment considerations relative to COIN are attractive – as we believe in the future of cryptocurrencies, emergence of blockchain clouds/decentralized finance and entire ecosystems that likely emerge around these new markets,"" Vafi wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""We are also positive about COIN’s ability to grow its user base at impressive rates and what this means for monetization beyond crypto.""
Coinbase, a fintech focused on cryptocurrency, went public in April. Shares have since dropped almost 30%.

Investing.com – Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) shares rose more than 1% in Wednesday’s trading as a study found that its drug cocktail reduced the risk of death in patients whose bodies hadn’t been able to mount a natural antibody response while suffering from severe Covid-19.
The RECOVERY trial, conducted by University of Oxford, found that adding investigational REGEN-COV to usual care reduced the risk of death by 20% in patients hospitalized with a severe case of the virus.
REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that’s designed specifically to block infectivity of the virus.
The injection is currently not approved but authorized for emergency use in the U.S. for treating mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older).

DETROIT (Reuters) - Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, will build its Polestar 3 electric SUV at Volvo's U.S. plant in South Carolina starting in the second half of 2022, the brand's chief executive said.
Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is ""nicely suited for the U.S. as a ... big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.""
The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said.
The Polestar 3 will be built on the same electric premium platform, called the SPA2, as the XC90, Ingenlath said. It will compete with such models as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Model X SUV.
Sweden's Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. 
The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said.
Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. 
Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3.
The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China. 

Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed.
In April, Polestar raised $550 million from investors to accelerate product development and said further fund raising could occur.

However, the stock has recently been downgraded by CIBC given headwinds that are swirling around the company. Federal legalization of marijuana in the United States will likely not happen this year and repealing marijuana laws could be a time-consuming process. This, along with the company’s post-merger uncertainties, could retard its growth. So, we think the stock is best avoided now. Read on.Canada-based medical cannabis and cannabinoid producer Tilray, Inc. (TLRY) has seen its stock price slump 41% over the past three months. This can be attributed primarily to pessimism surrounding its recently closed merger with Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA), Inc. In fact, CIBC analyst John Zamparo has downgraded TLRY from Outperform to Neutral. According to Zamparo, although federal level legalization of marijuana could add fresh impetus to the stock, the uncertainty surrounding the passage of such legislation could be problematic for TLRY.
TLRY’s stock has gained 127.6% over the past year, driven by a surge of interest in the cannabis industry. However, the stock is currently trading at $17.98, which is 73.2% below its 52-week high of $67, indicating short-term bearishness.
Since the expected removal of the federal ban on marijuana is expected to be a long, drawn out process, TLRY could face hurdles in its growth path. Furthermore, even as more states are legalizing recreational and medical cannabis, the Canadian operator’s entry into the U.S. market could face roadblocks given the competitive landscape.

However, a handful is bouncing back. Taylor Dart identifies two more stocks that investors should look to buy on weakness: Snap (SNAP) and Zoom (ZM).It’s been a volatile year thus far for the Nasdaq Composite (COMPQ), with the index up 9% year-to-date but enduring two sharp corrections along the way. Typically, this period of consolidation would have unearthed many values plays in the tech space, with valuations having time to play catch-up through this period of digestion. However, with more than 30 names still trading at more than 40x sales, and the price to sales ratio for the S&P-500 (SPY) in nose bleed territory at record levels, it’s much harder to find the value out there lately. This isn’t surprising after a 113% rally for the index in barely 15 months. Fortunately, two names have held up well over the past couple of months and looking to be showing strength relative to their peers. These two names trade at reasonable valuations and could be two solid buy-the-dip candidates if we do see a shake-out in the market.
(Source: TC2000.com)
Zoom Video (ZM) and  Snap Inc . (NYSE:SNAP) both had incredible years last year and broke out of large IPO bases, but both have spent the past several months correcting, which has brought them both to much more reasonable valuations. While Zoom Video is a Computer-Software name and was the leader of the stay-at-home trade, Snap comes from the Internet-Content industry group and has seen tremendous progress the past year in its key operating metrics. Both companies boast market-leading revenue growth rates of 60% or higher. While Zoom already has earnings on the table, Snap is set to post its first year of positive annual earnings per share in FY2021 if it can continue to see an acceleration in its business. Low-growth value plays have recently been the most in vogue, but it might be time to start looking at the high-growth value plays, and Zoom and Snap Inc. both look like solid bets if we see continued weakness.

The additional Moderna doses, which brings total U.S. orders to 500 million, could be used for primary inoculation, including of children, or as a possible booster shot, the company said. 
Moderna is currently conducting clinical trials testing a third booster shot of its authorized vaccine as well as an experimental one to protect against coronavirus variants.
The U.S. government last August signed a $1.53 billion deal with Moderna for 100 million vaccine doses, with an option to buy 400 million more.
The company has filed for a full U.S. approval of the COVID-19 vaccine currently being used and has also asked regulators to authorize its emergency use in adolescents aged 12 through 17.
U.S. President Joe Biden had set a goal to vaccinate 70% of American adults with at least one COVID-19 shot by the July 4 Independence Day holiday, although the pace of vaccination has slowed significantly since April.

The latest purchase also comes just a week after the Biden administration said it planned to donate 500 million  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries amid concerns of disparity in inoculations between advanced economies and developing countries.
Moderna, which has supplied 217 million doses of its shot to the U.S. government as of Monday, said the additional purchase was to ensure continuous supply through the first quarter of next year. The company said it was set to deliver 110 million doses in the fourth quarter and 90 million in the first quarter of 2022.

Bloomberg reported earlier that TUI was working with advisers on a possible 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) capital increase, sending the company's London-listed shares down by as much as 3.9%.
Last year, the pandemic stopped holidays and Hanover-based TUI has received multiple bailouts from the German government over the past 15 months. It will need to start repayments on some of its 4 billion euros of loans in 2022. 
""We are continuously looking at all possible scenarios with regard to the pandemic and refinancing,"" said a TUI spokesperson, adding this was in line with its previous statements. 
""Additional financing measures have not yet been decided. No banks have been mandated."" 
TUI chief executive Fritz Joussen has repeatedly said the company will consider asset sales and a capital increase to help pay down debt. He has also said a travel recovery will boost its finances.
In the group's German business, which alongside Britain is its biggest customer market, bookings are soaring, reaching higher rates than before the pandemic.

Investing.com – Shares of Kindred Biosciences (NASDAQ:KIN) jumped 45% in Wednesday’s premarket as the pet therapeutics company agreed to be acquired by  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN) for $9.25 per share, or $440 million.
Elanco shares rose too, and were up 4% in premarket trading. The company expects the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2021. 
The acquisition accelerates Elanco’s expansion in the attractive pet health market, particularly advancing presence in the fast-growing billion-dollar dermatology category.
Dermatologic symptoms such as scratching and allergies are the number one reason pet owners visit the veterinarian today.
The offer price is almost 46% more than KindredBio’s closing price on Tuesday. KindredBio shares were near that mark in premarket trading.
Elanco anticipates the combination will add approximately $100 million to its previously stated innovation revenue expectation of $500 million to $600 million by 2025, with “significant opportunity beyond the period.""
The transaction will be ""slightly dilutive to the full year 2022"" earnings per share, Elanco said in a note.
The company also reaffirmed second quarter 2021 revenue guidance of $1.225 billion to $1.255 billion, and full year 2021 revenue guidance of $4.670 billion to $4.710 billion.

1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>","Beyond Meme Stocks, Excess Has Ebbed Since Powell Said ‘Frothy’","(Bloomberg) -- When the Federal Reserve last met at the end of April, Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that markets “are a bit frothy.” Now, some of that excess appears to exiting -- particularly if you discount the daily gyrations in meme stocks.
Yes, share prices keep setting new records, but they’re also looking less expensive on the way up as companies largely crush profit forecasts. The price-to-earnings ratio for the megacap FAANG tech shares like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which make up roughly a quarter of the S&P 500, sits just below 47, which is almost its exact average over the past five years and down from nearly 59 in mid-February. Indexes are the same: The S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio is currently 30 after hitting an all-time high of 32 in late March.
In the eyes of JPMorgan’s Elyse Ausenbaugh, that cooling off means Fed officials likely feel little pressure to consider asset prices in their policy decisions as the last two-day meeting comes to a close this afternoon.
“Look at the five biggest stocks in the (S&P 500) and they’re actually trading at valuations that, relative to their history, aren’t all that unpalatable,” Ausenbaugh, a global markets strategist at the firm’s private bank, said on Bloomberg Television. “So I don’t necessarily think that the Fed is really having this perspective that they’ve got to manage or consider carefully as they determine what their future policy path is going to be.”
Meanwhile, Bitcoin has retreated nearly 40% from its April peak. Dogecoin -- the joke cryptocurrency that inspired Powell’s answer last time -- has seen its value halved since that meeting. An index of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, once the hottest destination for speculative cash, has largely traded sideways for the past several months.
Of course, there’s still plenty of speculative fervor surrounding the most popular stocks for retail traders. Theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. -- which is losing money and therefore doesn’t even have a price-to-earnings -- is up nearly 2,700% this year.  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)., another profitless business, has rallied more than 1,000% in 2021.
However, those companies are merely “a fly on the elephant in terms of market impact” and are unlikely to sway the Fed’s thinking in any direction, according to  Schroders  (LON:SDR) investment strategist Bill Callahan.
“Definitely some froth came out of the tech sector, we saw froth in crypto markets that is starting to come out,” Callahan said in an interview. “In the Fed’s mind, yes, those are pockets of froth. But that’s not going to shape their policy and economic outlook.”

Investing.com -- Shares of  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) were up 2% in Wednesday’s premarket following Pivotal Research’s confidence-boosting 20% higher target for the stock.
Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upgraded the stock to buy from hold.
He sees the stock at $60, up from his $50 target earlier and 49.4% higher from its closing level on Tuesday.
The stock price could get a little bump from any merger with AT&T’s DirecTV too, Wlodarczak believes.
According to Wlodarczak, Dish's risk/reward is ""simply too great” and the new target price is ""arguably conservative”.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Krafton Inc, the South Korean company behind blockbuster video game ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"", said on Wednesday its IPO would raise up to 5.6 trillion won ($5 billion) at the top of an indicative range, which would be a record for the country. 
Tencent-backed Krafton said in a regulatory filing it expected to offer 10 million shares, or 7 million new shares and 3 million existing shares, at an indicative range of 458,000-557,000 won per share. 
At the top of the range, this would be South Korea's largest listing, beating Samsung (KS:005930) Life Insurance's 4.9 trillion won IPO in 2010. 
The pricing is expected to be decided in the coming weeks, with listing expected in July. 
Krafton's online multiplayer war-fighting game PUBG has sold 25 million copies on PC and game consoles, becoming one of the fastest-selling games since its launch in 2017. 
Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent is currently Krafton's second-largest shareholder with a 15.35% stake through an investment vehicle, according to a regulatory filing. 
Krafton is planning to release two new games this year based on the PUBG intellectual property (IP), including mobile game ""PUBG: New State"" and ""Battlegrounds Mobile India"" targeting the Indian market. 
The company is also expanding to areas such as web-based cartoons, movies and animation, and developing a deep learning, AI business model targeting consumers. 
It reported 1.67 trillion won in revenue in 2020, and its operating profit more than doubled from the previous year to 774 billion won. 
The company estimated its valuation at 35 trillion won, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 45.2, which is slightly lower than South Korean game industry peers NCSoft and Netmarble, according to its filing.
Mirae Asset Securities is lead advisor for the IPO, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), NH Investment & Securities,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JP Morgan are also advisors. 
South Korea is experiencing its hottest IPO market on record with analysts expecting at least 20 trillion won to be raised in 2021, or about four times above 2020 levels.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive: GM to boost spending on electric vehicles 30%, add two new battery plants - sources","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will boost global spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $35 billion through 2025, a 30% jump over its most recent forecast as it pursues EV leadership, people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
As part of that spending, the No. 1 U.S. automaker will build two additional U.S. battery plants and move ahead some of its EV investments, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry.
The Detroit company declined to comment. 
The expected announcement of increased spending by GM comes less than a month after rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co upped its EV spending by more than a third to over $30 billion by 2030.
The combined $65 billion in commitments by the largest U.S. automakers, as well as increased spending by EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and startups including Lucid and Rivian reflect the EV arms race that has left some automakers like Lordstown Motors Corp scrambling to raise more funds.
In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. 
Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said.
WOOING WASHINGTON
Working with Washington is critical as President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging as part of his infrastructure plan, including $100 billion in new EV rebates. GM's ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. 
GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. 
The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive's comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion.
In January, GM said it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines.
GM and its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are already building a battery plant in northeastern Ohio and have announced a second, $2.3 billion battery plant will be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025.

On May 26, a Senate committee advanced legislation that would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs assembled by union workers in the United States. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500.
The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries. That would represent a big boost to GM's battery factory plans.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, in tight trading ranges ahead of the conclusion of the latest two-day Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, less than 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 15 points, or 0.1%.
Wall Street pulled back from record levels during Tuesday’s trading session, with the broad-based S&P 500 closing 0.2% lower after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, falling 0.7%.
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take any action this time round, but it may well flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit from crisis-era policies put in place at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The major indexes are all trading near record levels as the U.S. economy shows strong signs of recovery as the successful vaccination program allows businesses to reopen, while customers take advantage of the hefty stimulus packages the government has implemented.
Rating agency Fitch lifted its growth forecast for the U.S. late Tuesday, now seeing gross domestic product rising 6.8% in 2021, from 6.2% previously.
“The effect of the U.S. March stimulus has become clearer, including its contribution to the boom in U.S. consumer durables spending, now a staggering 30% higher than pre-pandemic levels,” said analysts at Fitch, in a note. 
Also of interest Wednesday will be the meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva. Among the range of topics the two sides are likely to discuss is likely to be the ransomware attacks by criminals reportedly linked to Russia, which have twice recently  targeted critical American infrastructure.
The economic data slate centers on the U.S. housing market later Wednesday, with housing starts and building permits data due for May.
In corporate news, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock will be in focus after the business software maker forecast current-quarter profit below estimates, as it ramps up investments in its cloud computing business to take on its large rivals.
Crude oil prices pushed higher again Wednesday, with Brent, the international benchmark, recording its fifth consecutive gain as falling stockpiles and a recovery in demand boosted sentiment.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.3% at $72.33 a barrel, after rising 1.7% Tuesday, while Brent was up 0.5% at $74.32, having risen 1.6% the previous session. 
Helping the tone Wednesday was the release late in the previous session of  U.S. crude oil stocks from the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a draw of just over 8.5 million barrels for the week ending Jun. 11. 
Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the day, and if the official body was to record a similar fall in inventories it would be the largest decline since January.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",Analysis: Investors ask U.S. SEC for more ESG disclosures as companies resist,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investor groups have asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for more corporate disclosures on climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues while business interests have pushed back, a Reuters review of correspondence published by the regulator shows.
The deadline for the public to submit comments to the SEC on the topic expired on Monday. Thousands of investors and advocates, from large asset managers to individual investors, as well as companies and trade groups made submissions, which were accessible on the SEC website. 
The SEC said last week it may propose new rules on ESG disclosures in October. Such a move would mark a big change under new SEC chair Gary Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden as part of a broader push to tackle climate change and social injustice. 
""The current state of climate change disclosure does not meet our needs,"" Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of more than 500 investors, environmental organizations and public-interest groups, said in one of the letters. 
The group called on the SEC to take a broad view of the impact of climate change, including the implications for human rights and the connection between climate, water, food and forests.
Companies and corporate lobby groups including trade groups for petroleum producers and banks, on the other hand, urged the SEC to give them broad discretion in their ESG disclosures. They argued one-size-fits-all requirements do not work in practice. Companies themselves are best placed to assess which information is the most important or material for their investors, they said. 
""Disclosure mandates should not be prescriptive, but rather should continue to be flexible so that disclosures respond to changes in facts, circumstances, risks and other developments,"" wrote Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The United States has no specific climate disclosure rules. It also has not agreed on definitions for key terms such as sustainable and has no uniform standards for measuring corporate environmental goals or quantifying and reporting climate risks, although many companies make ESG disclosures under a range of voluntary standards. 
The public comments will help inform the SEC's rulemaking, which must still undergo a formal process of consideration.
The stakes are high. More Wall Street fund managers are throwing their weight behind investor demands to companies on ESG issues. They are turning up the heat by publicizing how and why they voted, as billions of dollars flow every day into funds focused on sustainable investing. 
In the letters reviewed by Reuters, investors argued public disclosures of how a company's management attracts, develops and retains personnel -- also known as its human capital -- can shed light on its long-term prospects. They also want to be able to hold companies accountable on how they treat their workers.
""Stronger human capital reporting, especially quantitative metrics rather than just qualitative narrative, is associated with higher returns on invested talent and higher operating margins and better risk-adjusted returns,"" said Eleanor Eagan, a research director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project, a Washington-based non-profit organization that aims to educate investors.

Other investor-focused groups, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Principles for Responsible Investment, also said the SEC needs robust, consistent disclosures to help investors measure human capital metrics across sectors.
""For the SEC to get this right, investors will need to be very clear about what they are interested in and what they aren't,"" said Aniket Shah, who leads ESG and sustainability research at investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc.

The strategy strengthens a policy introduced in 2014 to exclude investment in companies which have failed to achieve ""sustainable palm oil"" production certificates or faced issues such as illegal logging, the fund business of French insurer AXA said in a statement.
Major fund managers, under pressure from end-investors and regulators, are focusing on more sustainable investment strategies. AXA IM also has policies to exit coal investments and reduce its own carbon emissions. 
Marco Morelli, executive chairman of AXA IM, said the company was ""committed to fighting deforestation and natural ecosystem conversion, as well as supporting forest restoration to ensure habitat conservation and to limit global warming.""
AXA IM said it would also increase engagement with companies it invests in in areas including palm oil, soy, timber and cattle to encourage them to preserve biodiversity.
It said it would build on its existing direct investments in sustainable forestry. 

Exposure to deforestation is a ""very material risk"" for investors, the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment has said.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>","Shocked by COVID deaths, young Indians rush for life insurance","By Chris Thomas and Sethuraman N R
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Like many other twenty-somethings in India, Beverly Coutinho kept postponing buying a life insurance policy, until a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths made her confront her own mortality.
""I saw people my own age dying, which prompted me to get life insurance immediately,"" says Coutinho, a 24-year-old senior executive at a public relations agency in Mumbai. 
""I wouldn't want my family to be in situation where they have to scramble for funds if something happens to me.""
The official count puts the number of deaths due to COVID-19 at 380,000, the third highest after the United States and Brazil, though experts say India's numbers are grossly underestimated due to the low levels of testing for the virus and more people have probably died in India than anywhere else in the world.
When a devastating second wave of the pandemic peaked in India during April and May, the numbers of people aged between 25 and 35 buying term insurance was 30% higher than in the previous three months combined, said PolicyBazaar, India's largest online insurance aggregator.
Term insurance purchases via online insurance aggregator InsuranceDekho's website rose 70% in May compared with March.
Insurers did not reveal how many plans they sold citing business confidentiality, but many said it was in the ""high thousands"".
""The current pandemic has led to higher awareness around the need for financial protection and the inadequacy of the current insurance coverage,"" Niraj Shah, chief financial officer of HDFC Life Insurance, said.
Shah's firm said it had seen more demand for protection products by the under-35 age group since the pandemic first struck India, around 15 months ago.
Industry executives say enquiries about insurance plans have rocketed despite the second wave of infections subsiding, probably due to strong prospects of a third wave given the slow start India made to the mammoth task of vaccinating its people.
BEHAVIOUR CHANGING 
Stock market investors still appear uncertain whether buying shares in life insurers is a good bet during a pandemic.
Since the start of the year the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 index has gained 13.5%, while shares in HDFC Life Insurance are up just over 2%, SBI Life Insurance has risen around 10% and ICICI Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Life Insurance has climbed nearly 18%.
""In the longer term, investment in insurers make sense as the awareness has risen about insurance,"" said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president research at SMC Global Securities in New Delhi. But he added that high valuations and a rise in number of claims due to the first and second wave were a concern.
Despite the lack of firm numbers on growth in the life insurance market, industry analysts see behaviour changing among middle class families in a country that has traditionally seen poor levels of coverage. 
""After clothes, food and home, insurance has now become the fourth pillar for a middle class family,"" Ankit Agrawal, InsuranceDekho's founder and chief executive, said.
Life insurance penetration among India's population stood at 2.82% in 2019, compared with 2.15% in 2001, the latest annual report from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority showed. 
That is still well down from a global average of 3.35% in 2019, but then a large section of India's 1.35 billion people lack disposable income to set aside for insurance, a situation made even more acute by the economic fallout from the pandemic.
Term insurance plans are popular in India because they are often cheaper and pay the family if the insured dies within the policy's payment period, though there is no maturity benefit if they outlive the plan. Demand for other kinds of insurance, including various medical cover, has also risen.

""If someone was thinking about buying insurance, they are actually doing it now,"" said Avneesh Sukhija, a senior financial analyst at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) India.

The share price of Japan's no. 1 carmaker exceeded 10,000 yen ($90.84) on Tuesday for the first time, as investors welcomed Toyota's strong sales, electric plans as well as its ability to tackle a global chip shortage better than the competitors.
The share reached 10,330 yen on Wednesday, a record high, valuing the company at more than $301 billion. U.S. electronic carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is valued almost twice that by investors at $577.38 billion.
Toyota shares closed nearly 1% higher at 10,175 yen.
""It could be accidental that our share price topped 10,000 yen as we prepared for the meeting, but we were so much encouraged because of it,"" said company president Akio Toyoda at the AGM held at Toyota's headquarter in Toyota City, Nagoya.
""We have made actions, errors and improvements. What we have now is the result of those 12 years,"" Toyoda said, when asked by a shareholder to reflect on his presidency as Japan's no.1 automaker for over a decade.
Toyota has said it will increase its number of electric models to around 70 from currently offered 55 by 2025, while aiming to make all its global factories carbon neutral by 2035.

The carmaker, which looks to fully redesign itself to a mobility company, needs to bring in multiple viewpoints and values as a driving force of creating innovation, Toyoda said.

""This is the first step in reducing the state's risk in the banking sector,"" Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson said in a statement published early on Wednesday. 
""With that we move closer to a healthier environment, similar to the Nordic countries and other neighbouring countries of ours,"" Benediktsson said. 
Islandsbanki, formerly Glitnir, was one of the three lenders that failed within days of each other in 2008, prompting a state takeover that resulted in the restructuring of existing banks and the creation of new ones.
At one point, the country's banks held assets worth 10 times the Iceland's economy, most of that in foreign currencies, making them overly exposed when the financial crisis hit.
Shares on offer were sold at 79 Icelandic crowns ($0.6533) and the offering, amounting to a value of $457 million, was the largest IPO in Iceland's history, Islandsbanki said.
Subscription for shares had ended on Tuesday at 1200 GMT and had been oversubscribed several times due to ""substantial interest"" from both retail and institutional investors, it said. 
The state has sold of 35% of its ownership in Islandsbanki, which has a domestic market share of around one-third and around 740 employees.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Group is in talks with South Korean chip companies to help it reduce reliance on foreign supplies amid a global shortage that has halted assembly lines at automakers around the world, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Hyundai officials have met with local ""fabless"" firms - which design chips but outsource manufacturing to the likes of TSMC and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd - as it explores long-term strategies to better diversify its supply chain, according to two people at local fabless firms who met with Hyundai.
The South Korean auto group, which houses Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp, wants to shift chips such as microcontroller units (MCUs) to South Korean designers, the people said. 
Such a shift will be hard, though, because local technology still lags industry leaders such as Dutch automotive chip supplier  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp, industry experts said.
""On top of facing high entry barriers to the auto chip market, long and strict qualification processes make it more difficult for smaller chip companies to design auto chips,"" a person at a South Korean fabless company said. 
""It would take four to five years to supply auto chips, while it could take less than one year for designing and producing chips for home appliances,"" the person said. 
""The company is pursuing plans to ""localize"" auto chips in a bid to diversify supply chains in South Korea after experiencing chip sourcing issues, mostly caused by suppliers being outside of the country,"" said a person at Hyundai's sister company, Kia. 
The South Korean automaker group houses Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp.
Hyundai has fared better than global rivals in the first quarter, thanks to its efforts to stockpile chip inventories in anticipation of tighter supplies.
But the shortage, exacerbated by factors including a fire at a chip factory in Japan and storms in Texas, is catching up with Hyundai.
The company has suspended production at its South Korean factories as well as its production in the United States due to chip shortages. 
The sources all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. 
Hyundai Motor Group declined to comment. 
 Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330), the group's parts company, said in a statement to Reuters: ""There are no on-going discussions with relevant companies, and while we think it is necessary to review chip development in the long term, there are currently no detailed directions or specific push concerning the issue."" 
DOMESTIC CONNECTION 
Hyundai has also reached out to contract chip makers, known as foundries, to discuss potential manufacturing plans, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
Analysts said South Korean fabless firms such as Silicon Works and Telechips, and foundry owners such as DB HiTek could work with Hyundai in the long term, but noted that Hyundai may not have held talks with them. 
""Hyundai presented its plans to produce in-house chips, but we haven't pinned down any specifics yet ... when it comes to expanding our production capacity, we need to make investment,"" said the person at one of the foundries in South Korea.
""Hyundai seems to believe that there would be enough or even strong demand for auto chips even after this recent chip shortage resolves,"" the person added. 
The global chip shortage is expected to stretch to the second quarter of 2022, according to research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT).

Analysts noted that foundries are don't like to expand production capacity for specific customers because it may take years to recoup spending on equipment and capital investment, and demand can change quickly.
""Our chips may not become Hyundai's major chips or substitute those chips already in use, but ours could be Hyundai's solution in times of shortage or disruption to supply chains abroad,"" a senior official at a fabless company said.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp may not be able to meet a March 2022 deadline for closing its $40 billion acquisition of British chip technology firm Arm Ltd due to European regulators' reluctance to consider the case until after the summer holidays, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Nvidia announced the Arm deal last year, sparking an immediate backlash in the semiconductor industry, where Arm has long been a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise intense rivals, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The company needs regulatory approval from U.S., European and Chinese authorities, all of which are expected to scrutinize the transaction closely. While Nvidia told investors last year that it plans to close the deal by March 2022, the purchase agreement gives the two companies the option to extend the deadline to September 2022. But at that point, either party has the option to walk away if the deal does not receive government approval.
Nvidia has not yet filed an application to clear the deal with the European Commission. Officials there have made it clear to the company that they need until September to gather enough information to accept Nvidia's formal application for approval, according to three people familiar with the matter.
That could make it difficult for Nvidia to close the deal by March of next year as planned, these people said. Technology news publication The Information earlier on Tuesday reported the possibility of a delayed filing https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidias-40-billion-takeover-of-arm-faces-new-foe-european-vacations in Europe. 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been gathering information about the deal, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Nvidia has filed for approval of the deal in China, the Financial Times reported last week. 
In a statement, Nvidia said that “many jurisdictions have a pre-notification period, where the parties have a detailed and ongoing dialogue with regulators. Our discussions with regulators have been thorough and constructive. We’ll continue to work throughout the summer, as we anticipated all along, and expect to close in early 2022.”
By the letter of the law in Europe, Nvidia can file its application at any time. But in practice, regulatory attorneys said, most companies wait until receiving an informal go-ahead from regulators before formally filing.
One regulatory attorney who has worked on European deals said a move to file before regulators have signaled they are ready to act on the application would be ""suicidal"" for Nvidia's good relations with European regulators.
""After nine months, the commission still feels there are very serious concerns,"" the attorney said. ""They are not ready to take this filing. If Nvidia goes down this road, it's a very confrontational strategy with a very powerful agency.""
The Nvidia-Arm deal also faces headwinds in the United Kingdom, which has said it will conduct a national security review of the deal. Headquartered in Cambridge, England, Arm is considered a crown jewel of the country's tech industry, and British regulators required it to set UK headcount targets before allowing it to be sold to Japan's SoftBank Group Corp in 2016.
Nvidia's stock has risen 37% this year, versus a 12% rise in the Nasdaq composite. 

The fear among chip firms is that Nvidia will give itself early access to Arm's innovations rather than distributing them to the entire industry on an equal basis. Nvidia and Arm officials have told Reuters they intend to keep ""firewalls"" in place at the combined company to prevent that from happening.
Questions on how Nvidia will run Arm took on new urgency in April when Nvidia said it will make an Arm-based central processor chip for data centers, its first major Arm effort and the centerpiece of its strategy to challenge rivals  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Wednesday morning but moves remained muted ahead of a highly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, due to be handed down later in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.31% by 10:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT). Trade data for May was lower than expected, with exports growing 49.6% year-on-year and the trade balance contracting to JPY187.1 billion. However, imports grew a better-than-expected 27.9% year-on-year.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.60% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.24%. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan said on Wednesday that the country is bolstering its legal arguments ahead of potentially taking its wine-tariff trade dispute with China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for arbitration.
The WTO action is “under active consideration” and Australia would be “making a decision very shortly,” Tehan added.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index Index edged down 0.16%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.49% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.55%. Economic data, including industrial production and the unemployment rate, will be released later in the day.
Investors eagerly await the Fed decision for clues as to when asset tapering will begin as the U.S. continues its economic recovery from COVID-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and California governor Gavin Newsom both lifted pandemic restrictions in their states.
Although some investors are using a so-called dot plot to predict an interest-rate increase in 2023, the central bank is unlikely to signal a scaling back of bond purchases until later in 2021.
“The outlook looks pretty positive but a lot of investors are asking for there to be better clarity on when we are going to have some start to the taper,” Kayne Anderson Rudnick portfolio manager and senior research analyst Julie Biel told Bloomberg.
“There’s a lot of nerves that we are going to wait too long, the economy is going to overheat and then we’re going to have to taper all at once, so there are a lot of dueling pressures,” she added.
Other central banks due to hand down policy decisions include the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan on Friday.
On the data front, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hovered around the 1.5% mark after Tuesday’s U.S. Commerce Department figures said core retail sales contracted a larger-than-expected 0.7% month-on-month in May.
Producer prices further stoked price pressures, with the producer price index growing a better-than-expected 0.8% month-on-month and 6.6% year-on-year respectively in May. Industrial production for May was mixed, growing a better-than-expected 0.8% month-on-month but slowing down slightly to a 16.37% growth year-on-year.
Also on investors’ radars is the meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin later in the day in Geneva. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will also testify on the federal budget before a House of Representatives panel a day later."

Macy's is benefitting from pent-up demand as people are eager to shop in stores. It's e-commerce division is also growing at a healthy clip.For the stock market, 2021 has been an inversion of 2020 in so many ways. Many of the biggest winners of last year have turned into some of the biggest underperformers this year. Just take a look at the work from home stocks, cannabis stocks, or the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Certainly, we can point to many factors such as the economy reopening, long-term interest rates moving higher, the rotation from growth to value, and the market’s general tendency to mean-revert especially when trends get extended.
Thus, it’s also not surprising that the laggards of last year are now outperforming this year. Some noteworthy examples include the energy sector as oil is now above the pre-coronavirus levels, travel and tourism stocks such as the airlines, hotels, and cruise operators, and retail stocks. 
Within that group, retail stocks are particularly interesting. Among the retail sector, one of the strongest performers in 2021 has been Macy’s (M) with a 67% YTD gain. Despite this impressive gain, I believe the stock has more upside for the following four reasons: the economy’s reopening which is leading to increased foot traffic to stores and more spending on formal attire; the company’s booming e-commerce sales; strong consumer spending figures; and very attractive valuations.

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Asda is to extend its trial of a refill scheme that allows shoppers to replenish their own containers after sales of several products in an initial pilot store outsold packaged alternatives, it said on Wednesday.
Asda, Britain's third-biggest grocer by sales after market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, said it would expand its refill proposition to four more stores by the end of the year, having launched the concept last year at its store in Middleton, Leeds, northern England.
Britons have become increasingly aware of the amount of plastic they use in recent years, with television documentaries such as David Attenborough's ""Blue Planet II"" particularly highlighting the dangers of plastic pollution to marine life.
In response supermarket chains and consumer goods groups are increasingly testing refills as part of a drive to cut single-use plastics.
Earlier, this month Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) extended its packaging-free refillable grocery concept ""Fill Your Own"" to 11 stores. Waitrose sells refillables in four stores.
Morrisons has been trialing refills for ambient and frozen products in three stores since 2019. A spokesperson for the chain said it was looking at how to bring refills to more stores, whilst thinking about how to make the format COVID secure.
Last year Tesco started trialing reusable containers for its online groceries service, while Sainsbury's is looking at a variety of options for refillable stations.
Asda's Middleton store trial launched with 30 household staples sold in refillable format, including Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s PG Tips tea bags, Persil laundry detergent and Radox shower gel; along with Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s cereals and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)'s Quaker Oats.
The Middleton store is Unilever's biggest refill trial in Europe.

""The rollout follows the successful launch of the Middleton refill zone last October, with several products outstripping packaged sales and many customers travelling from outside the local area to shop sustainably,"" said Susan Thomas, Asda's director of commercial sustainability.
The four additional stores will feature an increased range of core products and partnerships with household brands including Yorkshire Tea, an increased range of Kellogg's cereals, new own-label and Nestle cereals, Napolina pasta, and Tilda rice alongside new ""prefilled"" trials of Radox and Persil that will utilise stainless steel reusable bottles.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Lordstown Motors Corp has ""firm"" and ""binding"" orders for the first two years of production of its electric pickup truck, the startup's president said on Tuesday, sending shares up 6.4% a week after saying it had no binding orders for the vehicle.
""Currently, we have enough orders for production for '21 and '22,"" President Rich Schmidt said at an Automotive Press Association event in Detroit. ""Those are firm orders we have for those two years.""
""I don't know the exact facts of the legal aspect of that, but they are basically binding orders that are committed here in the last two weeks, reconfirmed orders,"" he added, when asked if they were binding orders. ""They're pretty solid, and I think that's on the light side or conservative side.""
Lordstown's shares, which shot up as much as 15%, were up 7.8% at $9.98 a share in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.
In March, Lordstown's shares slumped after investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position on the stock, saying the company had misled consumers and investors about its pre-orders for the Endurance truck that Lordstown initially said were worth $1.4 billion. 
The Ohio company subsequently said the orders were not binding and on June 8, when it warned it was running out of cash, disclosed in a regulatory filing it had no binding orders or commitments from customers.
On Monday, Lordstown announced that Chief Executive Steve Burns and its chief financial officer had resigned and acknowledged it overstated the quality of pre-orders in the trucks. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked the company for information related to the truck pre-orders. Schmidt declined to comment when asked for an update on the SEC inquiry on Tuesday. 
Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Schmidt also said Lordstown will seek additional funds from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and other early investors. GM owns a small stake in the startup.
In a statement, GM said, ""we are comfortable with our current relationship with LMC but we are willing to listen to proposals that make sense for both parties.”
Lordstown's plant can currently build at a rate of 20,000 vehicles per year without more investment, and the additional funds would allow it to expand beyond that level, said Schmidt, adding that the company has $400 million in the bank.
Angela Strand, who took over as executive chairman on Monday after Burns' resignation, said in an opening statement during the webcast that the company's plan remains to start limited production of the truck in late September.
The Endurance will be designed as a work truck and start at $55,000, Schmidt said. 
He made a pitch for investors to put capital into Lordstown before it begins production of the truck, saying those who wait will have ""missed the big jump.""

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is also targeting commercial customers with the electric version of its F-150 truck, the F-150 Lightning, which will launch next spring. A ""commercial base"" version will start at just below $40,000 before tax credits, while an XLT model that aligns with the best-selling gas version will start at almost $53,000.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indices closed lower on Tuesday as data showing stronger inflation and weaker U.S. retail sales in May spooked already-jittery investors awaiting the results of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.
Assurance from the Fed that rising prices are transitory and falling U.S. Treasury yields have helped ease some concerns over inflation and supported U.S. stocks in recent weeks. All eyes are now on the central bank's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
Data showed an acceleration in producer prices last month as supply chains struggled to meet demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy. A separate report showed U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May.
""There was a bit of a reaction to the economic data we got, which, for the most part, shows that the economy is starting to wean itself off stimulus, the recovery is slowing down a little, and inflation is continuing to grow,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA.
""We're seeing some very modest weakness, and it'll be choppy leading up to the Fed decision. Right now, the Fed is probably in a position to show they are thinking about tapering, but they're still a long way from actually doing it.""
The Fed is likely to announce in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond buying program, but will not start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll of economists found.
The benchmark S&P 500, the blue-chip Dow Jones and the tech-focused Nasdaq have risen 13%, 12.1% and 9.2% respectively so far this year, largely driven by optimism about an economic reopening.
However, the S&P 500 has been broadly stuck within a range, despite recording its 29th record-high finish of 2021 on Monday, versus 33 for all of last year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.42 points, or 0.27%, to 34,299.33, the S&P 500 lost 8.56 points, or 0.20%, to 4,246.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.29 points, or 0.71%, to 14,072.86.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors slipped. Among them was communication services, which ended 0.5% lower, having hit a record intraday high earlier in the session. 
The largest gainer was the energy index, which rose 2.1% on oil prices hitting multi-year highs on a positive demand outlook.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) had its best day since Mar. 5, jumping 3.6%. [O/R]
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gained 0.6% after the United States and the European Union agreed on a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies involving the planemaker and its rival Airbus.
Having slumped 19% on Monday, Lordstown Motors Corp shares rebounded 11.3% after comments from the electric truck manufacturer's president on orders.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.98 billion shares, compared with the 10.58 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 21 new lows.

The company is planning to double its capital spending on the cloud segment to nearly $4 billion in fiscal 2022 as it benefits from the pandemic with businesses opting for hybrid-work models.
Increased investment in cloud, however, led Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to forecast first-quarter earnings per share of 94 cents to 98 cents, below expectations of $1.03, sending its shares down 4.5% in extended trading. 
The company has been setting up more data centers to assist businesses as they expand operations, helping it beef up cloud offerings and win high-profile customers such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM). 
Investors and analysts though still see the 45-year-old company as a niche player when compared to giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Microsoft and Amazon. 
""The company still has a lot of work to do and progress to make before they are considered in the same category as the leading cloud infrastructure companies,"" said Scott Kressler, analyst at Third Bridge.
""One of Oracle's biggest issues is how small the company's revenue growth has been, despite a focus on its cloud solutions."" 

Oracle said it expects current-quarter revenue at its largest unit, cloud services and license support, to grow by 4%, which comes to about $7.2 billion, according to Reuters' calculations. Analysts on average expect it to be $7.36 billion.
The company posted adjusted profit of $1.54 per share on revenue of $11.23 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31, compared with estimates of a profit of $1.31 and revenue of $11.04 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers from both parties pressed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Tuesday about their smart speakers markets, amid concern over the domination of the tech behemoths in this area. 
Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, noted that Amazon had more than 50% of the smart speaker market while Google had 30%, and stressed the importance of interoperability.
""In a few years, people might easily have 20 or more connected devices in their homes – from a vacuum and a fridge to speakers and lights. We want those devices to work with each other seamlessly,"" she said. ""You shouldn't have to choose the right devices for your home based on whether they play nicely with Google or Amazon's digital assistants.""
Smart home technology includes smart speakers like Amazon's Echo or Google's Nest, security systems or televisions.
Google Senior Public Policy Director Wilson White said interoperability was a goal and there were ""robust conversations"" underway on how to achieve it.
Ryan McCrate, Amazon's associate general counsel, said Amazon wanted users to have access to multiple assistants from a single device if that was what the user wanted. 
Neither Google nor Amazon appeared to be trying for true interoperability, said Eddie Lazarus, chief legal officer for smart speaker maker Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO).

Google contractually prohibits Sonos from using technology that allows users to switch between Amazon's Alexa and the Google voice assistant, Lazarus said. He said Amazon's effort to work with smaller companies was ""just an on-ramp into the Amazon ecosystem because you can't mix and match between the big companies."" 
The hearing took place at a time of extraordinary interest in tougher antitrust enforcement, much of it focused on the biggest U.S. technology companies. One result has been a series of investigations and several federal and state lawsuits filed against Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as well as a long list of antitrust bills.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A highly touted bill to boost the United States' ability to compete with Chinese technology could take weeks to get through Congress, as U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers planned to write their own legislation, which must then be combined with what was approved by the Senate this month.
House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said House committees were working on their legislation, which he hoped would pass with support from Republicans as well as Democrats. 
""I think the House committee - or committees - have views that they want to express,"" Hoyer told reporters. ""... I don't think there's anything nefarious about it. I hope that we will move forward with a bill.""
Once the House passes its bill, negotiators from both chambers would work out differences and agree on a final version in conference. The House and Senate would both have to pass that final measure before it could be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.
""Hopefully we can work that out so that the best of both bills will be available to us, so that we can ensure our competitive status vis-a-vis China in particular and also dealing with some of the nefarious things that China does to pursue unfair trade tactics with our country, including intellectual property theft,"" Hoyer said.
House Science Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson said on Tuesday she favored an approach based on the current capabilities of the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, in contrast to the approach outlined in the Senate bill.
""If we are to remain the world leader in science and technology, we need to act now. But we shouldn't act rashly,"" Johnson said as the committee considered two bills that would be part of the House bill.
""Instead of trying to copy the efforts of our emerging competitors, we should be doubling down on the proven innovation engines we have at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy,"" she said.
The U.S. Senate on June 8 backed by a strong bipartisan 68-32 majority the ""U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,"" or USICA, which authorizes about $190 billion for provisions to strengthen U.S. technology and research, and approved $54 billion to increase U.S. production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.
It was not immediately clear how the House bill might differ from the Senate's approach on semiconductors. A global shortage of chips that has slowed production in the automobile and tech industries has added fuel to calls for the United States to rely less on China.

China's parliament expressed ""strong indignation and resolute opposition"" to the Senate bill, which was praised in Washington as a rare example of bipartisan action by the deeply divided U.S. Congress.
Biden's fellow Democrats control both the House and Senate, but only by narrow margins. However, the desire for a hard line in dealings with Beijing is a rare bipartisan sentiment in the deeply divided Congress.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 06:12PM ET</span>","Only Volkswagen, Volvo doing enough to electrify in Europe - study","By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Among the major carmakers, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Volvo are doing enough to electrify their vehicle lineups in Europe and the EU needs to set tougher CO2 emission limits if it wants to meet Green Deal targets, according to a climate group's study.
Sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids almost tripled last year, boosted by tighter emission standards and government subsidies.
This summer, the European Union is expected to announce more ambitious CO2 targets; by 2030, the average CO2 emissions of new cars should be 50% below 2021 levels, versus the existing target of 37.5%.
Volkswagen aims to have 55% group-wide BEV sales in Europe by 2030, while Swedish carmaker Volvo, owned by China's Geely says its lineup will be fully electric by then.
Based on IHS Markit car production forecasts, according to the study from European campaign group Transport and Environment (T&E), Volkswagen and Volvo have ""aggressive and credible strategies"" to shift from fossil-fuel cars to electric vehicles. 
Others like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have set ambitious targets, ""but lack a robust plan to get there,"" T&E said. 
Ford plans an all-electric lineup in Europe by 2030.
T&E said BMW, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Toyota rank the worst as they have low BEV sales, have ""no ambitious phase-out targets, no clear industrial strategy, and an over-reliance in the case of BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Toyota on hybrids."" 
JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), says its luxury Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, but has been less specific about electrification of its higher-volume Land Rover brand.
BMW and Daimler have been reluctant to set hard deadlines for phasing out fossil-fuel cars.
T&E said even if carmakers meet their targets, in 2030 BEV sales could be 10 percentage points below those needed to meet the EU's Green Deal - which targets net zero emissions by 2050.

Rather than a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, based on carmakers' existing production plans, the EU could set more ambitious targets, T&E said - an up to 35% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2025, around 50% by 2027 and up to 70% in 2030.
""Targets need to be gradually tightened so that carmakers not only commit to phasing out fossil fuels, but develop a strategy that gets them there on time,"" Julia Poliscanova, T&E senior director for vehicles and emobility said in a statement.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Sunday showcased 30 upcoming games and said most of those titles will be available on its monthly subscription service, Xbox Game Pass.
The company said it would launch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YnVzOA2wNs&ab_channel=Xbox new games on Game Pass every month through the end of the year, including titles such as PC strategy series ""Age of Empires IV"" and racing game ""Forza Horizon 5.""
One of Microsoft's big-ticket games, ""Halo Infinite,"" is now set for a holiday launch this year after being delayed due to the challenge of developers being stuck at home during coronavirus restrictions.
Several of the game launches announced by Microsoft at the E3 conference came from video game publisher Bethesda, behind hits such as Fallout and Doom. Microsoft last year bought ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda, for $7.5 billion.
Microsoft also announced launch dates of two big-budget games, exclusive to Xbox and PC - role playing game ""Starfield"" and vampire-themed shooting game ""Redfall."" ""Starfield"" will launch on Nov. 11, 2022 and ""Redfall"" next Summer. 
Both Microsoft and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) launched their next-generation gaming devices in November last year and have seen heightened demand for the consoles as gamers stuck at home due to the pandemic snapped up the devices.
Gaming analytics firm Newzoo forecasts that the global games market will generate revenue of $175.8 billion in 2021, with 2.9 billion players, and surpass $200 billion in 2023.
Microsoft has also been developing its cloud gaming service to attract casual gamers and its own streaming devices. 

Game Pass has hundreds of games playable on Xbox consoles, Android devices and PCs with a $9.99 monthly fee. 
""What makes us different from a service like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is that we give players both options, a subscription package and also a full retail store,"" said Phil Spencer, head of Xbox.

The Federal Aviation Administration said it had issued a temporary nationwide groundstop at the request of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) to resolve a computer reservation issue. The groundstop lasted about 45 minutes, and ended at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT), it said.
Southwest said its operations were returning to normal. The issue was the result of ""intermittent performance issues with our network connectivity.""
Southwest delayed nearly 1,300 flights on Tuesday, or 37% of its flights, according to flight tracker FlightAware.

Southwest Airlines earlier reported a separate issue that required a groundstop Monday evening after its ""third-party weather data provider experienced intermittent performance issues ... preventing transmission of weather information that is required to safely operate our aircraft.""
The airline said that issue affected several hundred flights and was resolved after 11 p.m. CDT Monday.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>",Investors sue U.S. regulator over Trump-era AGM resolution rules,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) -A group of investors sued Wall Street's regulator on Tuesday over rule changes that raise the bar for filing resolutions at annual shareholder meetings to call for new priorities or reforms.
The group is concerned that the changes, pushed through in 2020 by appointees of former U.S. President Donald Trump and set to take effect next year, will restrict shareholder democracy just as activist investors are starting to drive significant change in Corporate America.
More top funds are throwing their weight behind investor challenges to companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and are putting companies on notice by choosing to publicize how and why they voted.
The investors argue the new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules make it harder to hold companies accountable over hot-button issues such as climate change or workforce diversity, and want them set aside.
""This was a political rulemaking not warranted by the record or the evidence,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a California shareholder activist group and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
The two other plaintiffs are James McRitchie, an individual investor and frequent filer of shareholder resolutions, and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents religious groups and other institutional investors.
SEC representatives did not respond to questions about the lawsuit on Tuesday.
SEC commissioners voted 3-2 along party lines last September for changes including raising the threshold value of shares investors must own to file resolutions and the support levels needed to resubmit them.
Investors soon will need at least $25,000 of a company's shares if they want to file a resolution after they have held the stock for one year, for instance. They currently need to own at least $2,000 to do the same. They will be able to file a resolution owning $2,000 worth of stock only after they have held it for three years.
Asked about the lawsuit, Tom Quaadman, an official who follows capital markets for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce trade group, said it supported the rule changes ""as they reflect the needs of global 21st century capital markets that must be competitive and not push the interest of special interest activists who push agendas unrelated to economic return.”
GAINING TRACTION
ESG resolutions have gained more traction lately. A forthcoming analysis from proxy solicitor Georgeson, details of which were given to Reuters, found the pass rate of environmental resolutions at Russell 3000 companies rose to 36% so far this year, up from 21% in 2020, while support for proposals on social topics rose to 18% from 10% in the same period.
Many more were withdrawn as companies agreed to make changes like releasing workforce demographic information.
Georgeson Senior Managing Director Hannah Orowitz, who said the company did not have a position on the regulations, said if left in place the changes would likely cut back on future ESG-related proposals despite their rising popularity.
She cited one calling on Dupont to report on plastic pollution that won a record 81% support after it was resubmitted for the company's meeting in May, but which would barely have been allowed to be considered under the new thresholds given the limited support a similar proposal received in 2019.
Dupont representatives did not respond to questions.
The Democratic administration of President Joe Biden has taken several steps to encourage sustainable investing, including a declaration by the Labor Department that it will not enforce Trump-era rules curbing the use of environmental and social factors in retirement accounts.
Under new chair Gary Gensler, appointed by Biden in February, the SEC is gathering comments on such topics as how it might have companies report data like carbon emissions.
Senate Democrats had introduced a resolution to undo the SEC changes on shareholder proposals, but a deadline to move it has passed. 
The investor lawsuit claims the Trump-era SEC failed ""woefully"" to account for the benefits to shareholders of allowing more resolutions, such as stronger corporate performance. It alleges the regulator placed undue emphasis on the costs of the resolutions for the companies, which the regulator has previously pegged at up to $150,000. 

The SEC also failed to account for a study by its staff that found the rules could reduce the number of resolutions up to 78%, the lawsuit states.
The case is Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility et al v SEC, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 21-01620.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Accounting firm PwC said on Tuesday it would invest $12 billion over five years to create 100,000 new jobs aimed at helping its clients grapple with climate and diversity reporting and also in artificial intelligence, as part of its new global strategy. 
The new hires will come from mergers and acquisitions PwC completes and direct hires from competitors, Global Chairman Bob Moritz said in an interview. Of the 100,000 people PwC will hire, about 25,000 to 30,000 will be in the United States, and 10,000 of those will be from Black and LatinX communities, Moritz said.
At present, the firm employs about 284,000 people globally.
Moritz said PwC had approached ESG more ""narrowly"" before, focusing on reporting frameworks. 
""Now every employee of PwC has to be familiar with the issues,"" he said, adding that ESG will be embedded in the firm's work.
Companies and investors are more frequently examining their impact on the environment and scrutinizing diversity within their ranks, initiatives that extend beyond the traditional financial accounting and auditing services that PwC has long provided. 
Some asset managers weigh investment decisions based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors alone.
U.S. companies are also now gearing up for potential regulatory oversight of their environmental disclosures, board diversity and workforce.
PwC is increasing training for partners and staff in ESG in areas such as climate risk and supply chains and creating an ESG academy. 
PwC will also set up new leadership institutes that help executives, boards of directors and C-Suites create diverse workforces and manage in uncertain times. 

In addition to its focus on ESG, PwC is allocating $3 billion to invest in its Asia-Pacific region, aiming to double its business there. The region makes up about 18% of the firm's revenue currently, Moritz said.
The firm is also setting aside $1 billion to further automate parts of its auditing process.

""It's been a consumer-led recovery,"" the CFO said, particularly ""driven by the significant take up that we've seen as it relates to vaccinations.""
The bank, however, does not expect a sizeable uptick in corporate loan growth for the rest of the year, Mason warned, even as consumer borrowing is seen picking up in the second half.
""Given the liquidity that's in the market and all the debt issuance activity that we saw last year, I'm not expecting corporate loan growth in the balance of the year,"" Mason said.
The CFO also hinted at higher-than-expected expenses for the bank in the quarter, as the lender continued to invest in areas like investment banking, wealth management and others.
Investment banking revenues in the quarter are likely to be down in the low to mid-single digit range, the CFO said, adding that the pipeline in the segment remains strong.
The bank has been a leader in raising money for the so-called special purpose acquisition companies. A record $100 billion was raised by U.S. SPACs from the start of 2021 to March, according to data from Dealogic.

Mason also said he expects to hear back over the next month from potential buyers for its consumer operations in the Asia and markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa the bank is exiting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Investors retrenched and avoided major risks across multiple markets on Tuesday as markets awaited fresh guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday.
Wall Street took a step back on Tuesday, with all three major indices dropping after two posted record highs on Monday. U.S. Treasuries held steady, as did the U.S. dollar, with little activity ahead of the Fed policy statement.
The continued relaxation of pandemic restrictions helped drive oil prices higher on growing demand as vaccinated people begin to travel more freely.
Investors appeared reluctant to take on major new risks following a pair of disappointing economic data reports on Tuesday morning. One found retail sales shrinking more than expected in May, as consumers shifted their spending to service industries as pandemic restrictions ease. The second saw producers reporting higher price increases as they scramble to keep up with growing demand, exacerbating concerns about inflation.
""Supply constraints and surging demand seem to weigh heavy on companies. So while PPI is signaling that inflation is creeping up, keep in mind there are unique circumstances related to our economic comeback that are putting pressure on these numbers,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC). ""Since hitting its new high yesterday, the market was in a bit of a holding pattern today with the Fed decision on deck tomorrow.""
The readings loomed large ahead of the Wednesday statement. The central bank is not expected to announce any plans to ease back on its bond purchases until August, but investors are looking for any indication the Fed has begun discussing such an exit. Fed officials have said they view current price increases as transitory while the economy recovers.
Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a taper announcement will come in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.85 points or 0.12%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.42 points, or 0.27%, the S&P 500 lost 8.56 points, or 0.20%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.29 points, or 0.71%.
OIL JUMPS
Oil prices saw their highest levels since 2019 on Tuesday on the expected surge in demand.
Brent crude was up $1.30, or 1.78%, at $74.16 a barrel. U.S. crude was last up $1.41, or 1.99%, at $72.29 per barrel.
In currency markets, the dollar was muted against other currencies. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.02% higher at 90.511, after rising as high as 90.677 earlier in the day, its highest level since May 14.

Investor optimism about the sector is evident in the KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF’s (KARS) 48.6% returns over the past nine months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 25.7% gains.
However, the industry’s rising popularity has allowed the entry of several start-ups with paltry product portfolios and inadequate technological prowess to gain substantially through aggressive advertising. Moreover, a global semiconductor chip shortage has delayed product launches and/or deliveries for most companies over the past couple of months, rendering their current stock price levels unsustainable.
Against this backdrop, we think it's wise to now avoid fundamentally weak EV stocks Nikola Corporation (NKLA), Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK), and Lordstown Motors Corp. (RIDE). These stocks are currently trading at high valuations and could retreat in the near-term.

But what if investors no longer consider it a risk? Over the past week, this has become a pleasant surprise. Another month of data has pointed to inflation, but investors didn't seem to care this time. So, what does that mean for the S&P 500 (SPY) and our portfolio? I will cover that below. But first, let's recap the past week in the markets. Read on below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary from the POWR Value newsletter).
Stocks traded near record territory on Tuesday, before pulling back before the close. Investors were digesting economic releases and awaiting Thursday's key inflation update.
The market edged lower on Wednesday, with investors exhibiting caution ahead of Thursday's inflation report. Treasuries strengthened as the yield on the ten-year note fell four basis points to 1.49%, near a one-month low.

So, with that, we think it may be wise for investors to now take a closer look at two major players in this industry—Clean  Energy Fuels  (NASDAQ:CLNE) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG). But which of these two natural gas stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Clean Energy Fuels (NYSE:UUUU) Corp. (CLNE) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) are two established players in the natural gas sector. CLNE procures and distributes renewable natural gas (RNG) and conventional natural gas in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the United States and Canadian transportation markets. EOG explores for, develops, produces, and markets crude oil and natural gas in major producing basins in several regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and China.
Reduced natural gas production in the United States and record-high exports of LNG have been driving up the price of natural gas. An increasing demand for clean, low-carbon fuel is also expected to boost its price further. Also, as the major economies gradually reopen, the demand for natural gas is expected to go up even more given its application across several industries, such as energy generation and transportation. Investors’ increasing interest in the natural gas industry is evidenced by the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP’s (UNG) 11% gains over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 2.1% returns. So, we think both CLNE and EOG should witness solid upside going forward.
But while CLNE has gained 412.4% over the past year, EOG has returned 61.4%. CLNE’s more than 35% gain over the past month can be attributed to the meme craze because it is currently the most discussed stock on the subreddit WallStreetBets. However, in terms of year-to-date performance, EOG is a clear winner with 70.2% returns versus CLNE’s 42.1%. So, which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday it was seeking a $25.5 million fine from Air Canada over the carrier’s failure to provide timely refunds requested by thousands of customers for flights to or from the United States.
The department said it filed a formal complaint with a U.S. administrative law judge over flights Air Canada canceled or significantly changed. The penalty is ""intended to deter Air Canada and other carriers from committing similar violations in the future,"" the department said, adding Air Canada continued its no-refund policy in violation of U.S. law for more than a year.
Air Canada said it believes the U.S. government's position ""has no merit."" It said it ""will vigorously challenge the proceedings.""
Air Canada obtained a financial aid package this spring that gave the carrier access to up to C$5.9 billion ($4.84 billion) in funds through a loan program.
The carrier said it has been refunding nonrefundable tickets as part of the Canadian government's financial package. Since April 13 eligible customers have been able to obtain refunds for previously issued nonrefundable tickets, it said.
The Transportation Department disclosed it is also ""actively investigating the refund practices of other U.S. and foreign carriers flying to and from the United States"" and said it will take ""enforcement action"" as appropriate. 
The administration said the Air Canada penalty sought was over ""extreme delays in providing the required refunds.""
Refund requests spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Since March 2020, the Transportation Department has received over 6,000 complaints against Air Canada from consumers who said they were denied refunds for flights canceled or significantly changed. The department said the airline committed a minimum of 5,110 violations and passengers waited anywhere from five to 13 months to receive refunds. 
Last month, a trade group told U.S. lawmakers that 11 U.S. airlines issued $12.84 billion in cash refunds to customers in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic upended the travel industry.

In May, Democratic Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal called on carriers to issue cash refunds whether flights were canceled by the airline or traveler.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",San Francisco nearing vote to drastically cut refinery pollution with new tech,"By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) -California air quality regulators vote July 21 on a plan that would require two San Francisco-area refineries to install technology to curb pollution that exacerbates health problems, an official said on Tuesday.
Exposure to soot and fine particulate matter has been linked to health issues ranging from asthma to heart attacks. Recent studies have shown fine particulate matter has a disproportionate impact on communities of color and low-income neighborhoods that are often found near industrial plants.
The two refineries are urging the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) to adopt a less stringent standard that would not require them to install wet gas scrubbers, which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Dozens of refineries have already invested in the technology, including the nearby Valero Benicia refinery.
One refining company, PBF, warned that the cost would likely cause it to shut its facility.
The Bay Area is falling short of state and national air quality standards for particulate matter, requiring the region to further reduce emissions. The refineries in the Bay Area, including the 245,000 barrel-per-day (bpd)  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Richmond and the 157,000-bpd PBF Martinez, emitted 800 tons of particulate matter last year, according to the district.
Last week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would re-examine federal standards for particulate matter to protect public health.
Air particulate matter has been linked to increased risk of cancer as well as heart, lung and nervous system damage. Residents of Richmond, California, have one of the highest asthma rates in the state, according to county data.
A virtual meeting on the issue in early June drew more than 200 participants for more than five hours of testimony. Environmental activists want the more stringent rule, while union members said tougher measures would cause the PBF refinery to shut, resulting in job losses.
BAAQMD estimated that installing wet scrubbers would cost Chevron about $241 million and PBF $255 million. Chevron and PBF say it will cost them $1.5 billion and $800 million, respectively.
Refineries emit particulate matter when they operate their fluid catalytic cracking units (cat crackers) to turn crude oil into gasoline and high-octane products, as well as burn off petroleum coke. 
Under the more stringent rule, the refineries would need to limit annual emissions of particulate matter to 0.01 grain per dry standard cubic foot by 2026, in line with standards applied to new sources of pollution. The requirement would lower PBF and Chevron's particulate matter emissions by half or 400 tons per year, BAAQMD estimates.

The district said the refineries could consider cutting labor costs or increasing gas prices for consumers by 2 cents per gallon to offset the cost.
A less stringent amendment would require the refineries to meet a 0.02 gr/dscf standard by 2023, which would require improving and expanding existing controls at a cost of $30 million for Chevron Richmond and $80 million for PBF Martinez.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a three-day winning streak Tuesday after hitting an intraday record even as some on Wall Street suggest that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to spring a hawkish surprise.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, after hitting an intraday record high of 4,257.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.27%, or 93 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.71%.
The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting is expected to culminate Wednesday in an unchanged decision on interest rates and monthly bond purchases. But fresh clues on the central bank's thinking on inflation and views on the tapering its bond-buying program appear to be keeping traders on edge.
Fears of a hawkish surprise were exacerbated by data showing wholesale inflation jumped to record levels, just a week after consumer prices rose to their highest level since 2008. But some are warning against betting that the Fed will act too early.
""The market is probably overreacting,… it could be a mistake to think the Fed is going to act too early,"" Peter Duffy, chief investment officer of credit at Penn Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.  ""We believe the Fed will be patient as it is aiming for [sustainable] inflation ... what we're seeing now is obvious inflation [given] the pandemic last year.""
""The question is, what will inflation look like in 2022? I think the Fed is going to be very patient to see that play out,"" he added.
Others agree, pointing to the Fed's commitment to provide clear signaling before making a move on monetary policy. 
The Federal Open Market Committee has ""indicated it will first offer ample notice to the market before beginning the taper conversation and furthermore give ample warning before formally announcing intentions to taper, a process which itself will take quite some time,"" Stifel said.
Weaker retail sales data on Tuesday, meanwhile, pointing to softer consumer spending, the backbone of the economy, fell in May was largely downplayed by economists, who continue to suggest the recovery remains robust.
""Despite the modest pullback in goods spending, retail sales ex-restaurants are still 20%+ above pre-pandemic levels. We believe this excess demand is the main source of inflationary pressures which are likely to persist,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Tech, the leading sector in Monday's record day for the broader market, was the biggest decliner, with the Fab 5 in the red.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were lower.
The day of red for tech proved positive for value stocks on the ongoing rotation from value to growth and vice versa resumed.
Energy led the move higher in cyclicals as oil prices continued to trend near multiple-year highs on expectations for strong energy demand over the summer as easing restrictions boosts travel demand.
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was in the spotlight after the U.S. and EU agreed on a five-year truce over aircraft subsidies involving Boeing and European rival Airbus.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks spent almost the entire day in the red, with a drop in retail sales and an uptick in producer prices weighing on sentiment a day ahead of the Federal Reserve rate decision. 
The Fed's regular meeting began today, and the central bank is expected to announce unchanged interest rates and monthly bond purchases on Wednesday. But what we're all really looking for is any evidence of the bank's thinking on inflation and possible bond-buying tapering.  
Data earlier today showed that wholesale inflation jumped to record levels, a week after consumer prices rose to their highest level since 2008. But is it transitory?? Time will tell, my friends.     
Oil prices were the highest in three years on expected gasoline demand, despite disappointing demand from the Memorial Day weekend and unofficial start of road trip summer. 
In geopolitics, the world's heating up the popcorn to watch President Joe Biden meet Russia's Vladimir Putin. Here's hoping for a civil and peaceful discourse.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Decision Day 
The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell take center stage. Rates are likely to stay put. Everyone will be looking for clues and clarity on when policy makers will begin to discuss tapering, whether the recent bump in inflation is still ""transitory"" and how the overall recovery is going. Powell takes questions after the decision at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).
2. Housing starts
We get a look at the health of the housing market. Housing starts are expected to increase to 1.63 million in May, up from April's 1.57 million. Building permits and MBA mortgage applications are also due out at 8:30 AM ET.
3. 'Killer' meeting
Biden and Putin will have their first face-to-face meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. It's likely to be awkward, what with Biden having called Putin a ""killer"" in an interview earlier this year. Expect sanctions and cyber attacks to be high on the list of topics discussed.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",U.S. IPOs hit annual record in less than six months,"By Anirban Sen and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Wall Street's record-breaking run for stock market flotations shows no signs of slowing down.
With more than six months until the year ends, U.S. initial public offerings have already totaled $171 billion, eclipsing the 2020 record of $168 billion, according to data from Dealogic.
Driving the IPO rush are sky-high corporate valuations in the stock market, inflated by the Federal Reserve's low-interest rates and monetary stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has fueled a wave of speculative frenzy that benefit not just traditional companies going public, but also special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) formed strictly to raise money through IPOs.
The IPO gold rush is set to reach new heights in the second half of 2021, as a number of high-profile startups such as China's largest ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd, online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc and electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automative LLC prepare to launch multi-billion dollar share sales.
""If the markets hang in anywhere near where they are right now, we are going to be incredibly busy this summer, and into the fall with IPOs,"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Trees don't grow to the sky forever, so you're not going to have a record volumes every year. But assuming stability, we'd also expect a busy 2022.""
Excluding proceeds from SPAC IPOs, traditional listings of big names, including South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Inc, have raked in $67 billion this year, keeping 2021 on track to be the biggest year for such IPOs.
The average one-day gain for U.S. IPOs so far this year is 40.5%, compared with 28.2% during the same period in 2020 and 21.7% in 2019, according to Dealogic. The average one-week return for 2021 is 35.7%, higher than 32.2% in 2020 and 25.5% in 2019.
Capital markets bankers and lawyers estimate that companies could end up raising close to $50 billion through traditional IPOs, excluding SPACs, before the end of the September quarter. IPO proceeds have touched $24.1 billion in the second quarter through June 15, according to Dealogic.
Didi's offering alone could raise close to $10 billion, sources have previously told Reuters.
By the end of the year, U.S. IPOs could raise $250 billion to $300 billion or more - a staggering sum once considered unthinkable, according to investment bankers. 
""Five-hundred million used to be a pretty big IPO. Nowadays everything seems to be in the billions or three-quarters of a billion-plus. So there's really been an explosion in the size of transactions as well,"" said Jeff Bunzel, global co-head of equity capital markets at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""And there seems to be adequate amount of capital out there to help support that level of activity.""

SPACS FUEL BOOM
The record numbers have been fueled largely by the boom in listings of special purpose acquisition companies. 
SPACs, or blank check companies, are listed shell companies that raise cash with the sole purpose of merging with a private company within two years of the listing. The process takes the private company public.
During the first quarter alone, SPAC listings raised close to $100 billion, well above the $83 billion for all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research.
Despite the recent slowdown in SPAC dealmaking, 339 SPACs have been formed this year, raising roughly $105 billion or nearly two-thirds of the total IPO volume. In 2020, SPAC volumes accounted for less than half of the total IPO proceeds.
""Valuations are strong, fund flows are strong, and all the ingredients that you need to have an active and successful IPO market remain intact right now,"" said Bunzel. 

Investment bankers and lawyers also pointed out that the capital markets boom is attracting more companies that would have otherwise stayed private for longer, making the IPO pipeline even more robust for the foreseeable future.
""Because of the surge in SPAC transactions, a lot of companies are thinking this is an opportune time to hit the market and achieve attractive valuations. I think it's led to private companies being more receptive and interested in pursuing a public option,"" said Paul Tropp, who co-heads the capital markets group at Ropes & Gray.

This, along with their strengthening of their digital platforms, should help Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) dominate the retail space. So, we think it could be wise to now buy and hold these stocks.Brick & mortar stores have been witnessing rising foot traffic over the past couple of months thanks to a robust COVID-19 vaccination drive and the easing of social distancing protocols and mask mandates. With 43.7% of the U.S. population fully vaccinated as of June 14, people are opting for in-person shopping after more than a year of purchasing online. Physical stores should continue to witness rising sales because the government aims to vaccinate at least 70% of the population with at least one dose by July 4.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) expects retail sales to grow between 10.5% -13.5% to an estimated $4.44 trillion to $4.56 trillion this year. NRF expects the retail industry’s growth rate to be “the fastest growth that we’ve seen in this country since 1984.”
Current market trends indicate that people prefer retail shopping at physical stores over online shopping. In light of all these developments, we think major retail companies Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Target Corporation (TGT), which also strengthened their online platforms amid the pandemic, should grow significantly for the foreseeable future.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said Tuesday it had launched a $3 billion aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program that will cover up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for as long as six months. 
The program, funded by Congress, requires companies to commit to not conducting furloughs without employee consent or laying off employees covered by subsidies during the six-month period. Applications must be filed by July 13. 
Companies eligible include aircraft, engine, propeller or component manufacturers and companies that repair or overhaul airplanes and parts.
The subsidy program cannot cover more than 25% of an employer’s total U.S. workforce as of April 2020 and can only cover employees with total annual compensation of $200,000 or less.
To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or have experienced at least a 15% decline in 2020 total operating revenues. 
More than 100,000 jobs have been lost in the aerospace industry since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Transportation Department. Before then, the U.S. aerospace industry was estimated to employ approximately 2.2 million workers, including 1.2 million who worked in various parts of the supply chain nationwide. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which has had extensive job cuts, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and Spirit Aerosystems did not immediately respond to questions about whether they are considering applying.  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s aviation unit said it would not seek assistance from the program.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers had strongly urged Congress to fund the program.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 03:01PM ET</span>",FedEx to test package deliveries with self-driving startup Nuro,"By Nick Carey and Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and robotics company Nuro on Tuesday announced a multi-year agreement to test self-driving vehicles in the package delivery company's network, starting with a pilot program in Houston.
The partnership comes as parcel companies race to reduce the cost of last-mile delivery, which surged during the pandemic. 
The companies will target delivery scenarios where Nuro's low-speed, unmanned vehicle can provide ""the biggest bang for your buck,"" Cosimo Leipold, Nuro's head of partnerships, told Reuters in an interview.
That will likely include inefficient tasks like late-night pickups in out-of-the-way places, said Rebecca Yeung, FedEx vice president for advanced technology and innovation.
""Instead of dispatching a driver to get those packages, a device like Nuro could be super helpful,"" said Yeung, who called the FedEx/Nuro tie-up a ""very serious, long-term commitment"" that aims to reduce headaches, not human drivers. 
Nuro vehicles are already making deliveries for U.S. supermarket operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc in the Houston area. Nuro continues to test its technology in Arizona. 
Nuro, whose R2 unit has space for delivery cargo but not a human driver, said last year it has raised $500 million.
In a separate project, FedEx is using DEKA Research & Development Corp's smaller robot, dubbed ""Roxo,"" for on-demand, same-day deliveries in Plano, Texas. 
Rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) is centering its unmanned delivery efforts on drones. 

UPS has ordered electric delivery vans from British startup Arrival. Those vehicles are fitted with sensors and cameras that should gradually enable autonomous features, but will still require a human driver.
Transporting people via self-driving taxis is proving more difficult and expensive than delivering packages and food. As a result, freight and logistics companies are exploring ways to roll out the technology on predictable and simple routes, including on highways.

The yield spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, fell to 317 basis points as of late Monday, the lowest since October 2018.
For the ICE BofA U.S Investment Grade Index, the yield spread slid to 89 basis points, the lowest since February 2007.
The narrowing of spreads, which refers to the interest rate premium investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer U.S. Treasury bonds, comes as government debt yields are near their lowest levels ever, driving money into securities with lower credit ratings than Treasuries.
Ken Monaghan, co-head of high yield at Amundi US, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday that high-yield spreads ""can go tighter though not meaningfully tighter"" with the key reason being an increase in bonds rated BB, the highest level in the junk category, where ratings slide down to CCC, CC, and C as a risk of default increases.
""(BB-rated bonds) are now nearly 55% of the market versus about 49% at year-end 2019, or 45% 10 years ago,” he said.
Long maturity investment-grade bonds offer ""an attractive yield and on a spread basis, particularly to swaps, and could still tighten substantially,"" Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors, told the forum on Monday.
In the high-yield sector, he pointed to value in short maturities.
""Defaults are plummeting - we think as low as 1.5% over the next year - and short maturity (high yield) is pricing in too much default risk given our expectations,"" Contopoulos said.
The Markit North American High-Yield CDX Index, which acts as a proxy for the broad junk bond market, has been in record high territory for two months and is up 0.7% for the year.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last week began selling its stakes in 16 corporate bond exchange-traded funds as it unwinds a nearly $14 billion portfolio accumulated to help restore order to the market that had become unhinged early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since Stellantis was formed at the beginning of this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, production in Italy has been under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere in Europe. 
""Stellantis announced that Melfi would be the first plant in Italy to get new models, based on post-2022 business plan,"" UILM said in a statement after workers' representatives met with the carmaker at Italy's industry ministry in Rome.
Future production at Melfi will be based on a single enhanced production line that will merge the two existing ones, the union said, adding the restructuring will leave production capacity at the site unchanged at around 400,000 units. 
UILM's head, Rocco Palombella, said unions had not received all the answers they wanted as Stellantis was still working on its new business plan.
""But the positive element is that the company has not absolutely called for structural redundancies,"" he said after the meeting.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has said the group would present its business plan late this year or in early 2022. 
Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker, gave no details about what was discussed at the meeting.
In an earlier statement the company said it was working ""with determination and speed"" to support the energy transition of all its Italian sites.
Italy's Industry minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, however, said in a separate statement after the meeting that Stellantis had yet to decide where it would build its third electric battery plant in Europe.

Stellantis, which already has two battery factory projects in France and Germany, has said adding gigafactories in Europe and the United States would be decided this year. 
The company is holding talks on this with Rome, as Italy is one of its main production hubs in Europe.

MILAN (Reuters) - The contract Italy's Webuild won to build a high-speed railway between the U.S. cities of Dallas and Houston could give a significant lift to cash generation as early as 2022, a top executive at the construction group said on Tuesday.
""It will be material and transformational for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Massimo Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) told Reuters in a phone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday Webuild said it and its U.S. unit Lane Construction had signed the final agreement for a $16 billion contract with Texas Central LCC to build the high-speed link.
""We expect a boost in terms of marginality,"" Ferrari said when asked if the contract could help lift Webuild targets.
Ferrari said he hoped the financial closing of the contract would happen at the end of this year and that work could start in 2022, a year earlier than previously envisaged.
He said the project could take some five years to complete.
The contract brings the value of construction orders in Webuild's backlog from the United States to 35%, confirming the country as the single biggest market for the group.
Ferrari said the group had projects in the water and transportation sectors in the pipeline in the U.S., adding it would be pushing to win more high-speed train contracts in the country.

Because many investors are now looking to hedge a proportion of their portfolios against rising inflation by investing in high-dividend-yielding stocks, analysts expect China Life Insurance (LFC), Triton International (NYSE:TRTN), and DRDGOLD (DRD) to rally in the near term. Let’s discuss.The Federal Reserve has been holding benchmark interest rates near zero since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. economy recover. Though the economy has experienced a significant recovery so far this year, economists expect the Fed’s easy monetary policy to continue in the near term, with the first rate hike projected to occur in 2023.
Given the low interest rate environment, fixed-income investors are looking to bet on stocks that have steady dividend paying histories and offer attractive yields. This trend is likely to continue because the Fed’s dovish stance is not expected to change anytime soon. While the rise in Treasury yields caused some investors to shift to government-backed securities earlier this year, the recent boom in equity markets has caused Treasury yields to decline lately, making dividend stocks the best alternative for those investors. Also, given rising inflation, investors are rapidly shifting toward high-yield dividend stocks to hedge against rising price levels.
With increasing investor focus on dividend stocks, analysts expect the share prices of China Life Insurance Company Limited (NYSE:LFC), Triton International Limited (TRTN), and DRDGOLD Limited (DRD), which offer high dividend yields, to advance in the near term.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 01:47PM ET</span>",AstraZeneca antibody cocktail fails to prevent COVID-19 in large trial,"By Vishwadha Chander and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said on Tuesday a late-stage trial failed to provide evidence that its COVID-19 antibody therapy protected people who had contact with an infected person from the disease, a small setback in its efforts to find alternatives to vaccines.
The study assessed whether the therapy, a cocktail of two types of antibodies, could prevent adults who had been exposed to the virus in the past eight days from developing COVID-19 symptoms.
The therapy, AZD7442, was 33% effective in reducing the risk of people developing symptoms compared with a placebo, but that result was not statistically significant — meaning it might have been due to chance and not the therapy. 
The Phase III study, which has not been peer reviewed, included 1,121 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States. The vast majority, though not all, were free of the virus at the start of the trial.
Results for a subset of participants who were not infected to begin with was more encouraging but the primary analysis rested on results from all participants. 
""While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442,"" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the polymerase chain reaction tests which diagnose COVID-19.
The company is banking on further studies to revive the product's fortunes. Five more trials are ongoing, testing the antibody cocktail as treatment or in prevention.
The next one will likely be from a larger trial testing the product in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer or an organ transplant, who may not benefit from a vaccine. 
TARGETED ALTERNATIVES
AZD7442 belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies produced by the body to fight off infections.
Similar therapies developed by rivals Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) with partner Vir have been approved by U.S. regulators for treating unhospitalised COVID patients.
Regeneron is also seeking U.S. authorisation for its therapy as a preventative treatment.
European regulators have recommended antibody treatments by GSK, Celltrion, Eli Lilly and Regeneron for used in early-stage patients who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. The EU watchdog made the endorsement to support the use by member states ahead of an EU-wide marketing authorisation.
But the AstraZeneca results are a small blow for the drug industry as it tries to find more targeted alternatives to COVID-19 inoculations, particularly for people who may not be able to get vaccinated or those who may have an inadequate response to inoculations.
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has faced a rollercoaster of challenges with the rollout of its COVID-19 vaccine, is also developing new treatments and repurposing existing drugs to fight the virus.
AstraZeneca also said on Tuesday it was in talks with the U.S. government on ""next steps"" regarding a $205 million deal to supply up to 500,000 doses of AZD7442. Swiss manufacturer Lonza was contracted to produce AZD7442.

Shares in the company were largely unchanged on the London Stock Exchange.
The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the company said.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 01:03PM ET</span>",Exclusive - Indian scientists: We didn't back doubling of vaccine dosing gap,"By Krishna N. Das and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government doubled the gap between the two doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine without the agreement of the scientific group that it said recommended the increase, three members of the advisory body told Reuters.
The ministry of health announced the decision to change the gap from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks on May 13, at a time when supplies of the shot were falling short of demand and infections were surging across the country.
It said the extended gap was recommended by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), based on real-life evidence mainly from Britain. Yet the NTAGI scientists, classified by the government as three of the 14 ""core members"", said the body did not have enough data to make such a recommendation.
M.D. Gupte, a former director of the state-run National Institute of Epidemiology, said the NTAGI had backed increasing the dosing interval to 8-12 weeks - the gap advised by the World Health Organization. But he added that the group had no data concerning the effects of a gap beyond 12 weeks.
""Eight to 12 weeks is something we all accepted, 12 to 16 weeks is something the government has come out with,"" he added. ""This may be alright, may not be. We have no information on that.""
This was echoed by his NTAGI colleague Mathew Varghese, who said the group's recommendation was only for 8-12 weeks.
The health ministry, citing the head of NTAGI's working group on COVID-19, said that the dosing decision was based on scientific evidence. ""There was no dissenting voices among the NTAGI members,"" the ministry said on Twitter.
The ministry's statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1718308 on May 13 said that it had accepted the 12-16 weeks recommendation from NTAGI's COVID working group, as had a group of mainly government officials tasked with vaccine administration, known as NEGVAC.
Government health officials told a news conference on May 15 the gap was not increased to address a vaccine shortage but was a ""scientific decision"".
J.P. Muliyil, a member of the seven-strong COVID working group, said there had been discussions within the NTAGI on increasing the vaccine dosage interval but that the body had not recommended 12-16 weeks.
""That specific number was not quoted,"" he said, without elaborating.
N.K. Arora, the COVID working group head, declined to comment to Reuters on its recommendations but said all its decisions were taken collectively by the NTAGI at large.
A NEGVAC representative said it ""respects the decisions of the NTAGI and use them for our work"", declining to elaborate.
Real-world data released early last month by South Korea showed https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-says-astrazeneca-pfizer-covid-19-vaccines-87-effective-after-first-shot-2021-05-05 that one dose of the vaccines from AstraZeneca and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was 86.6% effective in preventing infections among people aged 60 and older.
Muliyil said this increased confidence within the advisory body that delaying a second shot would not be harmful.
The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for nearly 90% of the 257.5 million vaccine doses administered in India.
The dispute over doses comes amid criticism from some scientists that the government had been slow to respond to a new virus variant that led to a spike in infections in April and May.
The government has denied being slow to react, saying state-run laboratories had studied variants in real time and shared data with local authorities to allow them to take the necessary action.

Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist who recently quit a government panel on virus variants after criticising New Delhi over its response to the pandemic, said the authorities should clarify their position on the reasons for the decision to double the gap between doses.
""In a situation where we have a variant of concern spreading, we should really be vaccinating people at scale and making sure that they are protected,"" he added.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 01:02PM ET</span>","Americans are curious about electric trucks, but low cost, durability come first - Reuters/Ipsos poll","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - While most Americans expect electric vehicles eventually to dominate the nation's roadways, many have greeted the first battery-powered models with skepticism, expressing concerns about the potential costs and inconveniences of owning such vehicles, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.
Automakers have already recognized the challenge and said they plan to market future battery-powered models by touting their performance and long-term cost savings over environmental benefits.
Vehicle manufacturers need to win over more rural Americans and Republicans, with the survey showing those groups express less enthusiasm than others for electric vehicles.
Vehicle electrification, particularly of the most popular large, fuel-intensive light trucks and SUVs, has become a central part of U.S. efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change. In the Reuters/Ipsos national poll of around 1,005 adults from June 3-4, 67% of all respondents agreed in a bipartisan consensus that pickup trucks are the American way of life, underscoring the focus on electrifying those vehicles to reach climate goals.
Rural consumers in so-called red states or Republican strongholds are a key demographic for pickup trucks, the auto industry's most profitable vehicle segment, challenging automakers to navigate an electric future without alienating those customers.
Several automakers, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), are planning to release all-electric trucks in the coming years. But no electric pickup truck is yet available, which means consumer attitudes about them are largely based on second-hand knowledge. 
Graphic-What do you want in a truck? https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/SURVEY/qzjpqrgynvx/chart_eikon.jpg 
A majority of 65% agreed that electric vehicles are the future of the auto industry, the poll showed. While there were clear divisions along party lines - with 53% agreeing among Republicans, compared with 78% among Democrats - the issue is less partisan than other contentious U.S. political topics.
Nearly half of Americans - 46% - believe EVs are not worth the cost, the survey showed, with opinions again reflecting a political divide. EVs have a higher sticker price than comparable gasoline models, largely due to costly batteries.
When asked to consider buying a new truck, only a minority said they would search for one that minimizes its impact on the environment. Thirty-eight percent said they would look first for an efficient truck that costs less to operate. Another 34% said they wanted a durable truck, and only about 19% said they wanted an environmentally friendly one.
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS 
Jim Richman, a window installer in Austin, Texas, who owns a 2018 Ford F-150, said he is also concerned about the reliability of electric trucks and the hassle of charging them.
""I just want to know my truck is ready whenever I need it, and also for longer trips,"" Richman said, echoing a sentiment among a majority of survey respondents who said EVs generally were inconvenient because of their need for charging.
The auto industry is trying to alleviate those concerns with technological innovations, including reductions in battery costs and longer driving ranges. 
GM, which plans to start selling an all-electric version of its Hummer pickup by the end of next year, said more consumers will consider EVs as they become familiar with battery-powered vehicles. GM is also trying to emphasize economic benefits of going electric. 
""We have a tremendous opportunity to help consumers understand that benefits of driving electric aren't just related to the environmental benefits, but performance and capability that EVs offer,"" said Darryll Harrison, a GM spokesman.
Researchers expect EVs to reach price parity with fuel-powered counterparts around 2030, and EVs also provide long-term cost savings due to lower maintenance costs and the lower cost per mile of refueling with electricity instead of gasoline.
Ford said its research had shown consumer demand for an e-truck, especially among younger truck owners. The company plans to release its all-electric F-150 Lightning truck next year, for which it has received some 100,000 reservations to date.
""By 2030 we expect 40% of our global mix to be fully electric and we'll achieve that by electrifying our most popular name plates,"" said Darren Palmer, Ford's North America EV general manager.
Chris Sherman, general manager of a Ford dealership in rural Paris, Texas, said he has been surprised by the positive response to the Lightning so far.
""These are pretty much diehard gas and diesel pickup owners,"" Sherman said. ""Lot of people here are blue-collar, and they tow utility trailers. They want to know how much of a day's work they can do with their truck.""

Sherman said he had so far received 10 reservations for the electric truck and that he fields up to 40 phone calls per day about it.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,005 adults, and the results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union have agreed a truce in their near 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies, suspending for five years one set of Trump-era tariffs which had soured relations between them.
The two sides have been battling since 2004 in parallel cases at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and European rival Airbus, which each argued exposed the other to unfair competition.
They agreed in March to a four-month suspension of tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods from EU cheese and wine to U.S. tobacco and spirits, which the WTO had sanctioned. Businesses have so far paid more than $3.3 billion in duties.
On Tuesday they said they would suspend the tariffs for five years, in line with a Reuters report on Monday, while still working on the overarching agreement on subsidies they had envisaged in March.
""Grounding the Airbus-Boeing dispute delivers a major confidence boost for EU-U.S. relations,"" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference after an EU-U.S. summit with U.S. President Joe Biden. 
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the two sides had agreed to clear statements on what support could be given to large civil aircraft producers. They would also work to counter investments in aircraft by ""non-market actors"", she said, referring specifically to China.
Others were launching their own industries and the United States and the EU had been too busy fighting each other to pay attention, she said.
""The deal...includes a commitment for concrete joint collaboration to confront the threat from China's ambitions to build an aircraft sector on non-market practices,"" she said.
Both sides said they were confident the Airbus/Boeing dispute would indeed end within five years.
The United States and the European Union have agreed to set up a working group on the issue, provide financing on market terms, be transparent on R&D funding, avoid support that would harm the other side and cooperate to address ""non-market practices"" elsewhere.
Airbus said the deal levelled the playing field and ended ""lose-lose"" tariffs, which had also been imposed on planes. Boeing said the understanding committed the EU to address launch aid. 
Biden welcomed the ""major breakthrough"", as did ministers of France and Germany, both with Airbus facilities. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo said she was delighted the two sides had shown seemingly intractable problems could be resolved.
Shares of Airbus and Boeing traded slightly higher on the day.
BRITAIN WAITS, STEEL DISPUTE LINGERS
Former EU member Britain, which was also involved in the dispute as a home to Airbus production, said it hoped for a similar deal within days. Tai is due to meet her British counterpart Liz Truss on Wednesday.
The EU-U.S. agreement removes one of two major trade irritants left over from Donald Trump's presidency, the other being tariffs imposed on grounds of national security on EU steel and aluminium imports.
The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, last month suspended for up to six months a threatened June 1 doubling of retaliatory tariffs on Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) motorbikes, U.S. whiskey and motorboats, and refrained from slapping tariffs on more U.S. products from lipstick to sports shoes.
Brussels and Washington have said they would seek to address excess global steel capacity largely centred in China.
The United States may find it tougher to remove the metals tariffs, which also apply to other countries such as China, because they are still backed by many U.S. metal producers and workers.
An EU official said the two sides had a ""robust"" discussion on metals, with disagreement on the rationale for the tariffs. The EU hopes to resolve the issue by December.

Brussels is also pushing what it dubs a new ""positive agenda"" on trade with Washington, including forging an alliance to drive WTO reform. 
The two also agreed to cooperate on trade and technology, such as for setting compatible standards and facilitating trade in artificial intelligence.

U.S. lawmakers and the USDA are seeking to address concentration in the beef processing industry in the aftermath of a ransomware attack against meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) that disrupted U.S. meat production and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The proposed office would have a team of investigators, with subpoena power, dedicated to preventing and addressing anticompetitive practices and enforcing antitrust laws in meatpacking, according to a statement from the senators.
""I think it's a good proposal,"" Vilsack said at a congressional budget hearing. ""I think it's part of what needs to be done."" 

Four companies including JBS in 2018 slaughtered about 85% of U.S. grain-fattened cattle that are made into steaks, beef roasts and other cuts of meat for consumers, according to the USDA. 
The USDA has separately said it plans to strengthen its enforcement of a 100-year-old federal law intended to protect farmers and ranchers from unfair trade practices. The agency also said it will support increased processing capacity as part of a $4 billion initiative to strengthen the country's food system.

Let’s look closer at these names.After a miserable 2020, this year has certainly proved to be a ray of hope for the global economy.

However, amid rising fears of inflation and uncertainty surrounding its potential to prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy, the odds of investment success from betting on stocks have been reduced slightly.

We think investors looking to capitalize on the industry tailwinds in a relatively less risky manner could invest in United States Oil Fund, LP (NYSE:USO), Global X Uranium ETF (URA), and United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (UNG). These under-the-radar funds are well-positioned to benefit from the rising oil prices. So, let’s pore over these funds.As COVID-19-pandemic-led restrictions are easing worldwide with a solid progress on the vaccination front, the demand for oil is rising with increasing mobility and the resumption of industrial activities. This, coupled with continued supply cuts by the major oil producing countries, is leading to a surge in oil prices. The U.S. benchmark WTI Crude hit a 32-month high and Brent Crude surpassed the $73 a barrel mark on June 14.
Furthermore, according to a Research and Markets report, the global oil and gas pipeline market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 6% between 2021 -2026. And, despite decent progress in the U.S.-Iran talks regarding the lifting of sanctions, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects crude oil to rise to $80 per barrel by the end of the year. Also, even though production cuts may not continue for long, increasing demand for oil is expected to buoy the price rally. While it may be risky to bet on a particular energy stock to benefit from rising oil prices, a less risky way to do so could be to bet on energy ETFs.
We think relatively less followed energy funds United States Oil Fund, LP (USO), Global X Uranium ETF (URA), and United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (UNG) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now.

Taylor Dart explains why you should keep accumulating on weakness.It’s been a volatile couple of months for the price of silver (SLV), but the asset continues to outperform the S&P-500 (SPY) and gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) over the past 12 months, which is generally a very good sign for the precious metals complex. While new investors to the silver trade might be getting shaken out by the whipsaws over the past few months, it’s important to note that the long-term picture looks the best it has in several years, and the fundamental picture also remains quite bullish.
This is because real rates continue to their plunge to well below 4.50% heading into the Federal Reserve meeting this week, and precious metals also perform their best when there’s no opportunity cost holding them. Based on this strong fundamental and technical setup, sharp pullbacks should provide buying opportunities.
We’ve finally seen a strong bid return to the silver market over the past couple of months, but the trade has remained quite volatile, with silver trading within a nearly 20% range since its April low. While most of this volatility has been to the upside, further weakness is possible as silver heads into a seasonally weaker period between mid-June and month-end.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 12:28PM ET</span>",Volkswagen seeks partners for battery materials race,"By Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen is in talks with suppliers to secure direct access to raw materials for electric vehicle (EV) batteries via partnerships, one of its board members told Reuters on Tuesday.
The world's second biggest carmaker is trying to exert more control over key components in its supply chain such as semiconductors and lithium so it can overcome any potential bottlenecks and keep its plants running at full capacity.
The German carmaker is also trying to catch up with rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BMW which have already struck supply deals with producers of lithium, one of the main components in EV batteries.
""We're all in a race. It's about making the most affordable cells and you need scale to do that,"" said Thomas Schmall, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s board member in charge of technology.
""Apart from cell manufacturing, which is a new area of business for us, we need to move into vertical integration more strongly, procuring and securing raw materials. This can happen via various forms of cooperation,"" he said.
Gaining direct control over the supply of raw materials for EV batteries - which also include graphite, cobalt and nickel - is also vital to get a better handle on costs, Schmall said.
""80% of cell costs are determined by raw materials. So it's obvious that one needs to be more engaged.""
While Schmall did not identify potential suppliers, he said Volkswagen's goal was to have a small number of larger players to keep complexity under control.
The lithium market is controlled by mining companies such as U.S. firm  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB), China's Tianqi Lithium and Chile's Sociedad Quimica y Minera.
Among others, Volkswagen is seeking closer ties with Germany's BASF, one of the world's largest suppliers of battery materials, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Both companies entered a partnership last week along with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Fairphone to explore ways to produce lithium responsibly in Chile's Atacama salt flat, home to a quarter of the world's current lithium supply.
Volkswagen aims to overtake Tesla as the global EV leader by the middle of the decade and has mapped out plans to build six battery factories across Europe by 2030 together with partners.
Schmall said Volkswagen was very close to picking a partner for its planned battery factory in Salzgitter and hoped to give more details in the coming months, adding that all six factories would include strategic partnerships.
BMW has already struck deals with U.S. lithium manufacturer Livent (NYSE:LTHM) and China's Ganfeng Lithium, one of the world's top producers. Tesla, meanwhile, has agreed a five-year lithium hydroxide supply deal with China's Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group.
Volkswagen is also trying to get closer to chipmakers in the face of a global shortage of semiconductors, highlighting the multiple fronts it must tackle with its 150 billion euro ($182 billion) spending plan.
""For carmakers, it is strategically important to strengthen control over supply chains,"" said Ralf Blessmann, the head of Capgemini's automotive division in Germany. 

""The current chip crisis has laid bare the risks with regard to supply shortages.""

(Reuters) -European shares rose for an eighth straight session on Tuesday, driven by optimism over an economic recovery this year, but gains were limited as investors hunkered down ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.1% higher at a record closing high of 458.81 points, also marking its longest winning streak in more than two years. 
Dovish signals from the European Central Bank on tightening policy have brightened the near-term outlook for risk-driven assets in the continent, along with continued hopes that a steady vaccination program will drive an economic recovery this year. 
Focus this week will be on the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting starting Tuesday, where investors will be looking for insight on whether the central bank has begun discussing tapering bond purchases and if policymakers are concerned about rising inflation.
""We don't expect officials to rush into taking a decision now, (but) it would be interesting to see whether there will be a discussion around the matter, and if so, whether we will get any hints over a potential desired pace of withdrawal,"" said Charalambos Pissouros, a senior market analyst at JFD Group.
""A fast pace may suggest that Fed officials do not see the surge in inflation as transitory as they did in the past and may hurt equities.""
Stronger-than-expected producer prices data in the United States raised some concerns that the Fed could signal tightening policy earlier than expected.
Germany's DAX ended just below all-time highs as data showed consumer prices rose 0.5% month-on-month in May, in line with economists' expectations.

""We think Draftkings has systematically skirted the law and taken elaborate steps to obfuscate its black market operations from the investing public,"" Hindenburg said. (https:// 
The sports betting operator is the latest target in Hindenburg's recent string of attacks against companies that went public through mergers with blank-check firms, with EV maker Lordstown Motors and Nikola Corp also getting caught in the short-seller's crosshairs.
""This report is written by someone who is short on Draftkings stock with an incentive to drive down the share price,"" said Draftkings, the official betting operator of golf tour organizer PGA Tour and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
Draftkings, which allows users to enter daily and weekly fantasy sports-related contests, faces varying regulations on online gambling across regions. In the United States, it has live betting operations in states including Colorado, Illinois and Indiana.
Its shares have more than doubled in value since the company went public in April last year in a three-way merger with its SPAC sponsor and a Bulgaria-based gaming technology firm SBTech. 
Based on its analysis, Hindenburg said SBTech has a long and ongoing record of operating in black markets, exposing Draftkings to such dealings.
Draftkings said when it completed the merger with SBTech, it carried out a review of their business practices and was comfortable with the findings.
The boom in the SPAC market over the last year is seen to be deflating as these companies face increased regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investing.com -- Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) dropped 2% after a report it will start allowing other sellers to use its platform in a bid to fight off the giant threat that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) presents. 
The goal is to boost web traffic and revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported. Express and J. Crew are following similar paths. 
Such marketplaces are common on Amazon, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and others, but there is a risk of diluting their own brands. Marketplaces take a cut of each transaction, helping increase revenue.
At Amazon, third-party sellers make up almost 60% of overall retail sales, compared with 34% in 2010 and 3% a decade earlier. 
More product listings mean better placement in search results, bigger orders and fewer abandoned carts, according to Adrien Nussenbaum of Mirakl, a company that works with retailer  to add marketplaces, The Journal reported. Shoppers are more likely to leave a site without completing their purchase if they can’t find everything they are looking for, he said.Shares of Urban Outfitters have more than doubled over the past 12 months, while revenue (aside from one quarterly pandemic dip) has remained relatively steady in the past few years.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 11:53AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bank of America leaves Wall Street wondering about next CEO,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Brian Moynihan took the reins at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) in 2010, the U.S. bank was reeling.
Its former CEO suddenly left as scandals and probes related to a major acquisition unfurled. Its stock price was tanking, and the global financial crisis was still going strong.
Since then, Moynihan, 61, has not just righted the ship, but transformed Bank of America, leaving analysts, industry people and some investors wondering what - and who - comes next.
Moynihan has no imminent plans to leave, but as his tenure continues, so does the mystery of who will replace him. Candidates who were clear front-runners have grown too old, while those recently promoted to Bank of America's management committee are too fresh-faced.
That leaves Moynihan with a new challenge over the next few years: determining who would best replace him, and marketing that person to the world without alienating other senior executives.
""Who becomes CEO is not a minor thing,"" said Sydney Finkelstein, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.
Moynihan's predecessor, Ken Lewis, left after months of public drama and decisions that resulted in criticism from lawmakers, regulators and investors, Finkelstein noted. Although Moynihan has the bank on much steadier footing, he has been there long enough for constituents to want a road map for the future, Finkelstein said.
""You're not going to leave the bank in that same mess,"" he said. ""OK, well, what are you going to do?”
Moynihan was not available for an interview, said a spokesperson, who declined to comment for this story.
LAST ONE STANDING
It is not unusual to have leadership voids at companies with relatively fresh CEOs who want to groom deputies over 5-10 years. The situation is less common at companies with CEOs who have been in place for a long time, and have effectively executed their visions, sources said.
Of the six biggest U.S. banks, Bank of America is the only one not to have changed CEOs in recent years or outlined a relatively clear succession plan lately.
Circumstances are different at each institution. Yet it leaves Moynihan as the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street who has not offered a crisp idea of who is next, analysts said.
""Up until now, Brian Moynihan has wanted to see through the changes that he spearheaded,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte. ""But now he has done that.""
The perfect successor would be about 45-50 years old now, have experience leading different parts of Bank of America's eight businesses, be comfortable with regulators and understand the bank's social-purpose agenda, said several recruiters.
That leaves no obvious internal candidate to succeed him.
""Now that he has four or five years of runway left, investors should be rightfully saying, 'Hmmm,'"" said one former bank employee.
Bank of America's board takes succession planning seriously and has the topic on its agenda, said a different person who was familiar with the board's thinking. The board met twice last year to discuss the topic.
They both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters or avoid professional consequences for speaking to the press.
Headhunters mentioned seven Bank of America executives as contenders: Raul Anaya, Dean Athanasia, Cathy Bessant, Steve Boland, Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare and Andy Seig. PNC’s Mike Lyons and former SunTrust executive Mark Chancy are also possibilities, they said.
Moynihan’s No. 2, Tom Montag, could take charge if his boss had to leave immediately. But at 64, Montag is not viewed as a long-term CEO candidate.
'RESPONSIBLE GROWTH' Few expect Bank of America to outline a detailed succession plan any time soon, but a prolonged search can be risky because the best people may grow impatient and leave, sources said.
Moynihan won his own succession battle partly because of his legal expertise. He spent years resolving hairy regulatory probes and lawsuits, including a $17 billion settlement with the Justice Department in 2014.
He also set his sights on cost-cutting and integrating a tangle of businesses that created Bank of America from deals spanning two decades.
Moynihan’s strategy helped Bank of America produce a $16.5 billion profit and 6.8% return on equity last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, compared with a $6.8 billion profit and 0.3% return on equity in 2009. Its share price is now about $43, compared with $16 when Moynihan took charge.

As the global economy heals from COVID-19 and business picks up, analysts expect the bank to do even better.
Investors like Warren Buffett have embraced Moynihan's mantra of ""responsible growth."" Buffett has accumulated nearly 12% of Bank of America shares, while selling stock in rivals.

BoA reiterated its buy on the stock on Monday, convinced that the company will hike its dividend payout before the end of the year. Activist investors have been chasing ExxonMobil for a higher dividend amid calls from various quarters to do more on the ESG front.
ExxonMobil's dividend payments to shareholders have grown at an average annual rate of 6.1% over the last 38 years, the company not paying them for the third and quarter of the last fiscal year being the rare exceptions.

While the outage has been attributed to a solitary software bug, the company’s market reputation took a big hit, causing Oppenheimer analysts to downgrade the stock from Buy to Hold. And because analysts expect FSLY’s growth potential to remain subdued in the near term, we think the stock is best avoided now. Let’s discuss.Real time content delivery network company Fastly, Inc. (FSLY) was downgraded by Oppenheimer on June 10, causing the stock’s price to decline 6.2% from a $54.73 intraday high. Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan downgraded his rating on the stock from Buy to Hold following the global internet outage triggered by a software bug.
Though the company’s prompt response has drawn praise, Horan expects investors to switch to alternative platforms given the lower cost of switching content distribution network (CDN) for second source providers, and the large number of established players.
In addition, FSLY’s mixed performance in the last quarter has created uncertainty regarding the company’s operational efficiency. Despite a 35% year-over-year rise in revenues in the first quarter, ended March 31, FSLY’s non-GAAP loss per share doubled to $0.12.

With rising demand for metals amid continuing supply issues, metals’ prices are expected to continue rising in the near term.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>","EU data watchdogs ruling sharpens focus on Facebook, big tech","By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants could face more scrutiny and potential sanctions in the European Union after the bloc's top court backed national privacy watchdogs to pursue them, even when they are not the lead regulators.
Consumer lobbying group BEUC welcomed Tuesday's ruling by the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), which backed the right of national agencies to act, citing enforcement bottlenecks.
""Most Big Tech companies are based in Ireland, and it should not be up to that country's authority alone to protect 500 million consumers in the EU,"" BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said after the judgement.
Along with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has its EU headquarters in Ireland, putting it under the oversight of the Irish data protection regulator under privacy rules known as GDPR, which allow for fines of up to 4% of a company's global turnover for breaches.
The CJEU got involved after a Belgian court sought guidance on Facebook's challenge to the territorial competence of the Belgian data watchdog, which was trying to stop it from tracking users through cookies stored in the company's social plug-ins, regardless of whether they have an account or not.
""The BE DPA (Belgium's data watchdog) now needs to analyse the judgment in more details to determine whether any of the situations described ... apply to the case it has opened against Facebook in 2015,"" Hielke Hijmans, Chairman of the Belgian Data Protection Authority's Litigation Chamber, said.
Several national watchdogs in the 27-member EU have long complained about their Irish counterpart, saying that it takes too long to decide on cases. Ireland has dismissed this, saying it has to be extra meticulous in dealing with powerful and well-funded tech giants.
Ireland's cases in the pipeline include Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Twitter, Apple, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Media, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast.
""Under certain conditions, a national supervisory authority may exercise its power to bring any alleged infringement of the GDPR before a court of a member state, even though that authority is not the lead supervisory authority,"" the CJEU said.
Judges said these conditions include regulators following cooperation and consistency procedures set out in the GDPR and that the violations occurred in the relevant EU country.
""We are pleased that the CJEU has upheld the value and principles of the one-stop-shop mechanism, and highlighted its importance in ensuring the efficient and consistent application of GDPR across the EU,"" Jack Gilbert, Facebook's associate general counsel, said.
BACK DOOR OPEN
But tech lobbying group CCIA said the ruling could lead to inconsistent and uncertain enforcement and jack up costs.
""It has also opened the back door for all national data protection enforcers to start multiple proceedings against companies,"" CCIA Europe senior policy manager Alex Roure said.
""Data protection compliance in the EU risks becoming more inconsistent, fragmented, and uncertain,"" he said.
However, David Stevens, President of Belgium's DPA, said the ruling was ""a good thing for the protection of the privacy of citizens, and for the harmonized application of the GDPR.""
""We have always been convinced of the importance of maintaining a possibility for authorities to act on behalf of users,"" Stevens added in a statement.
Wojciech Wiewiórowski, of the EDPS, the EU privacy watchdog for EU institutions such as the European Commission and the European Parliament said the ruling confirmed that a lead supervisory authority cannot ""go it alone"" and must closely cooperate with other data protection authorities. 

Wiewiórowski said it had stressed the need for ""sincere and effective cooperation to preserve both consistent interpretation of the GDPR and the effectiveness of its provisions"". 
The case is C-645/19 Facebook Ireland & Others.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>","Pre-owned business jet shortage drives sellers' market, demand for new luxury planes","By Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - A shortage of newer-model business jets is driving up prices of second-hand aircraft, a trend that is expected to deliver a windfall for luxury planemakers as new affluent buyers enter the market.
After a turbulent 2020 due to COVID-19, the rush toward private transport is so marked that some buyers are snapping up second-hand planes before fully inspecting the wares as the market shifts toward sellers, lawyers and brokers said.
That is expected to push up demand for new jets from planemakers like General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream,  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) and Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc since buyers have fewer pre-owned options, and the price gap between old and new narrows.
""There are virtually no young pre-owned aircraft available - good news for would-be sellers and for (planemakers),"" said aviation analyst Rolland Vincent.
He recalled one trucking company's recent search for a pre-owned Gulfstream jet: ""There was one aircraft in the world that fit their requirements.""
Traffic from business jets, which carry roughly a handful to 19 travelers, has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in the United States, the world's largest market for private aviation, according to FlightAware data.
""On the pre-owned side, inventory appears to be fairly low, and that’s always a benefit to new aircraft sales,"" said Scott Neal, senior vice president worldwide sales, Gulfstream.
""We are seeing strong interest across the board from first-time buyers and high net worth individuals as well as corporate customers with a desire to grow their fleets.""
Textron in April raised its full-year profit forecast, propelled by a rebound in business jet demand. 
The trend could encourage some planemakers to increase production rates, although any ramp-up would hinge on supply chain capabilities, Vincent said. 
Planemakers do not disclose total number of orders.
Preowned aircraft for sale in May accounted for 6.6% of the worldwide fleet, the lowest level recorded in 25 years by JETNET data, Vincent said. He said 864 pre-owned business jets sold during the first four months of 2021, up 36% from the same period last year.
""There are multiple offers on planes,"" said Florida-based aviation attorney Stewart Lapayowker, founder of Lapayowker Jet Counsel PA. 
Amanda Applegate, a partner at Aerlex Law Group, said she handled more deals for new jets than usual in May, as buyers fail to secure popular pre-owned planes like the G650, raising prices.
Applegate said it's a case of pent-up demand as some wealthy travelers previously avoided private jets due to concerns like ""flight shaming"" over the environment. Corporate planes burn more fuel per passenger than commercial. 
But since COVID-19, buyers have been shifting to private aviation to avoid airport crowds and coronavirus variants.
Applegate said some deals are so competitive she's seen buyers give up pre-purchase inspections to win them.
Don Dwyer, managing partner at Guardian Jet, which does aircraft brokerage, appraisals, and consulting, recalled one case where a client didn't undertake a pre-purchase inspection, which can take more than a month to complete.

It was a particular case since the plane was highly coveted, in good shape based on a visual inspection, and the seller was reputable, Dwyer said.
""I don't recommend it, but in certain situations it can work.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said that work is underway on companion legislation to antitrust bills introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives last week.
While none of the four tech-focused House antitrust bills introduced Friday have a Senate companion, Klobuchar said late Monday that she expected that to change. ""I think you'll see a number of bills introduced in the Senate,"" she said, but declined to elaborate.
Two of the bills introduced last week address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.

A third would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in. A fourth would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere if they desire, including to a competing business.
The House members also introduced a fifth bill which is a companion to a Klobuchar measure that has already passed the Senate and would increase the budgets of antitrust enforcers and make companies planning the biggest mergers pay more.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a cycling boom, with many people buying bikes to exercise or to avoid the risk of infection on buses or trains.
Dresden-based Bike24 said the price range for its listing has been set at 15-19 euros per share, which would give it a market value of 662-812 million euros.
The deal would be the latest in a flurry of IPOs, with online fashion retailer About You due to go public on Wednesday, following online used car dealer Auto1 earlier this year.
Online sporting goods retailer Signa Sports United plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with a blank check company, in a deal valuing the firm at $3.2 billion. It is using some of the proceeds to buy bicycle goods store Wiggle, making it about four times larger in the sub-sector than Bike24.
The flotation would give Bike24 a valuation of 2.1-2.5 times its expected revenues, a premium to the Signa Sports United deal, which was valued at at 1.6 times.
U.S. financial investor The Riverside Company first invested in Bike24 in 2015. CEO Andres Martin-Birner and his fellow founders are also shareholders in the business, which was founded in 2002.
The Bike24 offering consists of new shares worth 100 million euros. Altogether, shares worth 386-459 million euros will be sold, assuming a full exercise of the over-allotment and upsize options.

Investment banks Berenberg and JP Morgan are advising on the initial public offering for Bike24, which has achieved growth rates averaging 30% in recent years. The company last year posted earnings before interest and tax of 10 million euros in 2020 on revenues of 199 million.

The Swedish company will exclusively stream 'Call Her Daddy' starting July 21, including all back catalogue full-length episodes, future episodes and additional exclusive new projects in development, Spotify said in statement, without disclosing any financial details of the deal.
The three-year old raunchy talk show grew popular with a younger female audience on candid conversations about sex and relationships, with fans referring to themselves as 'The Daddy Gang'. It is also the fifth-most-popular streamed podcast globally on Spotify.
Cooper, 26, formerly hosted 'Call Her Daddy' with her best friend Sofia Frankyln. But a public spat over contractual disputes with the podcast's current owner sports and pop-culture focused digital media firm Barstool Sports led to Franklyn leaving the show to start her own independent podcast. 

Spotify has been boosting its podcast muscle by spending more than $500 million in buying podcast networks Gimlet and Anchor, and podcast advertising company Megaphone.
Spotify declined to comment on financial details, but the Wall Street Journal had reported https://on.wsj.com/3cHauQV on June 11 that the agreement could top $20 million, citing people familiar with the matter.

Belarus scrambled a warplane to force a Ryanair flight to land in Minsk on May 23. The plane was carrying an opposition journalist who was then arrested, prompting punitive measures against Belarus in response. 
Belarusian carriers are now banned from flying over European Union and UK territory, while EU and British authorities issued a safety directive saying their aircraft should avoid Belarusian air space unless in an emergency.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told a British parliamentary committee that while he supported those measures, the aviation industry depended in the long term on unrestricted access to all airspace and that this must be restored.
""We need to have an outcome where the European and the UK authorities, hopefully assisted by international partners, receive appropriate assurances from the Belarusian, and or Russian authorities, that this will never happen again,"" he said.
Short-term sanctions were necessary to deter other states from copycat behaviour, he added, but in the long term the politicisation of airspace was not the answer as it would hurt the aviation industry and international connectivity. 

""The freedom to overfly states is something that we have perhaps taken for granted for the last 70-80 years,"" O'Leary told the lawmakers. ""We must restore it as quickly as possible.""
The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is investigating the forced-landing incident and due to report back in two weeks.

Let’s find out.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Ocugen, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:OCGN) shares soared to hit their 52-week high of $18.77 on February 8, 2021 following its agreement with Bharat Biotech to commercialize COVAXIN, an advanced stage whole-virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in the United States. However, OCGN’s shares fell sharply after it announced on June 10 that instead of pursuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVAXIN it will submit a biologics license application (BLA). The stock has declined 35.6% since the announcement.
Furthermore, the stock has lost 38.7% over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $6.13. Most of the company’s gene therapies to cure eye diseases—OCU400, OCU410 and OCU200—are still in their early stages of development.

We believe these names possess attractive growth and momentum features. Read on.
While the COVID-19 pandemic affected the U.S. economy severely last year, it experienced a V-shaped recovery this year. Thanks to several rounds of fiscal stimulus, an ultra-low interest rate environment and easing public health anxiety with the roll out of COVID-19 vaccines, the economy now appears to be on solid footing.
This, along with a decent global economic recovery, has helped the stock market bounce back from its bottom in 2020 to hit all-time highs. This is evident in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite’s gains of 79.8%, 84.6% and 106.3%, respectively, from their lows in March 2020.

The flatpack furniture group, which has recognised there were some improper practices, was accused of breaching employees' privacy by reviewing records of their bank accounts and sometimes using fake employees to write up reports on staff.
Worker representatives said the information was used to target union leaders in some cases or used to IKEA's advantage in disputes with customers, after the firm trawled data on people's finances and even what cars they drove. It was also found to have paid for access to police files. 
Prosecutors had been pushing for a 2 million euro fine. Lawyers for France's CGT union and several individuals seeking compensation said the final amount was not hefty, but welcomed the outcome. 
""It's the symbolism here that matters,"" said Solene Debarre, a lawyer representing the CGT. 
The company said it was reviewing the court decision to see if further measures were needed, after it took steps to stamp out the surveillance tactics. 
""IKEA Retail France has strongly condemned the practices, apologised and implemented a major action plan to prevent this from happening again,"" the Ingka group said. 
IKEA employs around 10,000 people in France, its third biggest market after Germany and the United States, and has experimented with new formats there, including a store launched in 2019 in the heart of Paris.
It is best known for its vast self-service stores out of town but many shoppers have shifted online, particularly during the pandemic lockdowns when demand for office furniture, food jars and cooking products grew strongly.
The Ingka group's operating profit in the year to the end of August 2020 fell, hurt by store closures during the coronavirus crisis, though it has projected a rebound.
FINES 
The firm's former chief executive in France, Jean-Louis Baillot, was found guilty in the case and handed a two-year suspended prison sentence. Judges fined him 50,000 euros for storing personal data.
The allegations centred on the 2009-2012 period, although prosecutors said the spying tactics began in the early 2000s. 
In total 15 people faced accusations in the trial.
Two of the accused were found not guilty of all charges against them, including a police officer, and Stefan Vanoverbeke, who ran IKEA in France from 2010 to 2015 and still has a senior position in the group's retail operations.
Others were cleared on some charges, such as systematically divulging confidential information, but found guilty of others, including illegally obtaining personal data.
Sanctions ranged from a 5,000 euro fine for a former human resources manager to several suspended prison sentences. 
IKEA fired several managers and overhauled its internal policy after the allegations came to light in 2012. 
The Swedish firm has long denied setting up a widespread espionage system, and was absolved on Tuesday of systematically violating personal data.

IKEA operates through a franchise system. Ingka Group is the main franchisee to brand owner Inter IKEA Group.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>",Airbus says it has no plans to build bigger single-aisle jet,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus on Tuesday sought to dampen speculation about an upgrade to its best-selling A321neo single-aisle model, saying ""there is no such thing"" as a proposal to build what some media have dubbed an A322 with more seats and newer wings.
Industry sources have said Airbus has kept in reserve studies based on carbon wings and updated engines if needed to counter any new plane that rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) might launch in the top end of the medium-haul market, where Airbus has a strong lead.
Airbus executives on Monday said they were happy with the current wings and engines on the existing portfolio.
They confirmed that Airbus is examining a possible freighter version of its A350 wide-body jet, but said the company would only launch such a development when the conditions were right. 
Traditionally dominated by Boeing, the freighter business is underserved by Airbus, Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said.
A stretched version of the smaller 110-130-seat A220 is technically possible but not before the Canadian-designed jetliner programme reaches ""cruising altitude,"" he added. Demand for the jet is strong including interest from China, he said.
He was speaking during an Airbus product presentation.
Airbus is seeing some pricing pressure in the jet market in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis but is putting emphasis on protecting value rather than chasing prices, Scherer added.
It has fewer than five ""white tails"" that have been built but left stranded without a buyer, while most aircraft parked outside its factories are being stored on behalf of customers, he said.
Airbus also hit back at concerns raised by Boeing over the design of its newest narrow-body jet, the A321XLR.

In a recent European regulatory filing, Boeing said a novel type of fuel tank could pose fire risks.
Scherer called the comment ""slightly provocative and outdated"". Boeing had no immediate comment.

(Reuters) -Investors shorting ""meme stock"" AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings are estimated to have lost about $512 million on Monday after a rally that sent the cinema operator's shares up more than 15%, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed.
By contrast, AMC short-sellers suffered $1.2 billion in mark-to-market losses for the week to May 28, when small-time traders on online discussion groups sent the stock up about 116% by triggering a phenomenon known as a ""short squeeze"".
AMC shares were up 2% at $58.12 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock has surged more than 2,580% so far this year, riding a wave of support from individual traders who have come together on online forums such as Reddit's Wall Street Bets.
Recent reports from brokerages Fidelity and Freetrade show AMC has been the most traded stock by their customers, many of whom are small-time investors.

Market sources told Reuters last week that the volatility in AMC shares had led some professional traders to use options to limit their risk as they make bearish bets on the stock.
AMC has raised funds in recent weeks by issuing fresh equity to hedge fund Mudrick Capital and selling stock ""at-the-market"", as it capitalizes on the blistering rally in its stock. It plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for potential acquisitions of theaters.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will supply electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cell systems for rail supplier Wabtec Corp's locomotives, in a move extending the No. 1 U.S. automaker's reach outside the automotive sector.
Wabtec, based in Pittsburgh, is developing locomotives powered by electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in response to rail industry demand to eliminate carbon emissions. It has a test electric locomotive model and intends to build a second generation version, with deliveries starting in 2023.
""The rail industry is on the cusp of a sustainable transformation with the introduction of batteries and hydrogen to power locomotive fleets,"" Wabtec Chief Executive Rafael Santana said in a statement. 
Under the nonbinding memorandum of understanding, GM will supply Ultium electric batteries and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell power cubes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
""Wabtec's decision to deploy GM's Ultium battery and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology,"" GM President Mark Reuss said.
Ultium is a key part of GM's strategy to roll out efficient and cost effective electric vehicles, and closing a deal with Wabtec would help spread development costs over a larger volume of batteries. GM is developing a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered commercial truck with truck maker Navistar (NYSE:NAV).
GM's Ultium batteries will be built by the company's joint venture with South Korea battery maker LG Energy Solution, which is building plants in Ohio and Tennessee. The hydrogen fuel-cell systems will be assembled by GM's joint venture with Honda in Brownstown, Michigan.
Last month, Wabtec announced that its FLXdrive all-electric locomotive, during a test program with BNSF Railway in California, delivered more than an 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the entire train - the equivalent of over 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel saved and about 69 tons of CO2 emissions reduced. It is also developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered locomotives.
The 430,000-pound electric locomotive, with a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours (MWh), uses 18,000 lithium-ion battery cells, Wabtec's chief technology officer, Eric Gebhardt, said in a recent interview. It generates its energy largely through regenerative braking.

The company intends to build a second-generation electric locomotive with a battery capacity of more than 6 MWh, a level it says can reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30%. Gebhardt compared that capacity to 100 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles.
Wabtec expects to begin shipments of the second-generation electric locomotive in mid-2023, he said. The company has not disclosed volume targets.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) said on Tuesday it will launch an electric vehicle rental pilot program for ride-hail drivers in a part of the San Francisco Bay Area in partnership with a local utility.
The EV rental program in San Mateo County south of San Francisco is scheduled to begin this fall. It initially aims to provide roughly 100 EVs for use on the Lyft platform, the ride-hail company and Peninsula Clean Energy said in a statement.
Peninsula Clean Energy, San Mateo County's official energy provider which aims to provide 100% renewable energy by 2025, will provide $500,000 in incentives to ride-hail drivers to ensure the cost of renting an EV is comparable to a gas-powered car.
Lyft said exact rental prices and models were still being determined. 
The program is operated by Lyft's Flexdrive unit, which works with local car dealerships to rent out vehicles on a weekly or long-term basis.
Lyft already offers EV rentals in Seattle, Atlanta and Denver, where drivers are able to rent Kia Niro and Chevy Bolt EVs.
Peninsula Clean Energy CEO Jan Pepper in a statement said the San Mateo program might eventually lead to more drivers switching to EVs. 
Utilities across the United States are embracing EV sales growth as both a promising new source of revenue and an opportunity to use excess wind and solar power generated when supply exceeds demand.

Lyft and its larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc have promised to convert their U.S. fleets entirely to EVs by 2030. In 2018, less than 1% of all ride-hail miles in California were electric, according to company data provided to the California Air Resources Board.
California regulators last month adopted rules to mandate that nearly all trips on Uber and Lyft's ride-hailing platforms must be in electric vehicles within the next few years.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) -French luxury group Chanel expects to increase sales by double digits this year compared with their 2019, pre-pandemic levels, the group's chief financial officer said on Tuesday after the coronavirus crisis hit revenues in 2020.
Privately-owned Chanel, known for its tweed suits, quilted handbags and No. 5 perfume, is one of the biggest brands in the 280-billion euros ($340 billion) global luxury industry alongside LVMH's Louis Vuitton.
The group's sales last year totalled $10.1 billion, an 18% decline at constant exchange rates that is steeper than that seen at some rivals. Revenues at LVMH fell by 16% in 2020, while those at Hermes were down by just 6%.
""As we speak, we are growing double digit versus 2019 so far this year and we see no reason for this trend to change,"" Chanel's finance chief Philippe Blondiaux told Reuters, adding to signs that big luxury groups are emerging from the crisis more quickly than expected initially. 
He said that China and the United States in particular were driving the rebound, which he saw as more than a temporary surge sparked by shopping deprivation. 
""We're beyond what some have called revenge buying, we believe it's a deep and lasting momentum, which may not be true for all the players in the luxury industry but it's true for the big brands which continued to invest, as we did.""
Chanel spent a hefty $1.36 billion in 2020 to support its brands.​ Blondiaux said the strong recovery seen since the autumn of 2020 had been broad-based, encompassing Chanel's fashion, fine jewellery, watches and skincare products, though revenues for its sizeable fragrances and make-up business, which is heavily exposed to duty free sales, were flat compared with 2019. 
ONLINE OUTLIER
Even when it was forced to shut stores due to coronavirus lockdowns, Chanel had stuck to its long-held strategy of not selling fashion, watches and fine jewellery online. 
Instead, like many rivals it turned its sales assistants into personal shoppers showing collections to clients, organising fitting sessions and special deliveries at home, and keeping in touch through a new app, Blondiaux said.
The fashion house, which does however sell cosmetics and perfumes online, said e-commerce sales in these areas had grown 113% in 2020 and were up 57% so far this year. 
Chanel prides itself on having a strong local customer base and Blondiaux said its rule of thumb of doing 80% of its business locally rather than relying heavily on tourist shopping was now true in China and many Asian countries.
""We don't see this changing in a dramatic way in 2022, the repatriation (of spending) that we have seen in 2020/2021 is here to stay, at least for an extended period of time,"" he said.
The group, founded in 1910 by Coco Chanel, has not yet increased prices this year, but this may happen in the second half -- in line with its policy of reviewing prices worldwide twice a year, he said. 
The health crisis has further exposed the divide between healthier and weaker luxury brands and may accelerate consolidation in the sector, Blondiaux said -- adding however that the group owned by billionaire brothers Alain and Gerard Wertheimer did not have any M&A ambitions.

""Chanel will not participate in this consolidation either as a target or as an acquirer. We will be out of it,"" he said.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>","Electric-truck maker Lordstown's CEO, CFO resign, shares slump (June 14)","(Corrects to founders from CEOs in paragraph 14)
By Subrat Patnaik and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp on Monday announced the sudden departure of its chief executive and finance head, just days after the electric truck maker warned that it may not have enough money to stay in business over the next year, sending shares down more than 20%.
The resignations of founder and Chief Executive Steve Burns and Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez come as the company's board reported conclusions from an internal investigation into claims made by short-seller Hindenburg. Burns is Lordstown's largest shareholder with a stake of more than 26%, according to Refinitiv data.
Lordstown acknowledged it had overstated the quality of pre-orders for the company's electric trucks, but rejected as false Hindenburg's accusations it had overstated the viability of its technology and misled investors about production plans. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which advised the blank-check company that merged with Lordstown last fall and helped put together the deal's financing, declined to comment.
When it announced its deal to go public through a reverse merger last August, Lordstown said it had pre-orders for its Endurance pickup truck worth about $1.4 billion. After Hindenburg accused the company of misleading investors on the pre-orders, Lordstown said they were non-binding and has since said it has no binding orders.
The company named lead independent director, Angela Strand, as executive chairwoman to oversee the firm's transition until the appointment of a permanent CEO. She will take part in a media appearance Lordstown had scheduled for Burns and other executives on Tuesday.
""We remain committed to delivering on our production and commercialization objectives,"" Strand said in a statement. Lordstown did not make Strand available for an interview.
Strand, 52, is managing director of an advisory firm specializing in technology and business strategy, and has worked with fleets and fleet management companies, the types of customers Lordstown is aiming to win after Endurance production is scheduled to start in September. 
RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said Burns was not the right fit for Lordstown as it attempts to build production and a change in strategy could occur with new leaders, putting at risk the company's advantage of being the first with an electric pickup on the market. 
Lordstown disclosed customer deliveries won't begin until the first quarter of 2022, putting it just ahead of the spring launch of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's electric F-150 Lightning.
Becky Roof, who had previously served as interim CFO at numerous companies including Eastman Kodak and Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co, was named interim finance chief of Lordstown, effective immediately.
Lordstown also disclosed in a regulatory filing it has hired a unit of AlixPartners, an advisory firm known for helping companies restructure operations.
Since the going-concern warning last week and a free fall in its share price, the company has tried to allay some worries by saying it was in talks with multiple parties to raise funds.
""It was untenable for the company to secure necessary new capital with a management team widely seen as potentially not leading the company into the next era of its development,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note. 
Lordstown and fellow EV maker Nikola, both of which went public via acquisitions by SPACS, have become a target of short-seller Hindenburg. Both companies saw their founders subsequently resign.
In March, Hindenburg disclosed it had taken a short position in Lordstown shares, saying the company had misled consumers and investors. 
Subsequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked the company for information related to its SPAC merger and pre-orders of its vehicles. 

Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson said the news was not a surprise.
""Today's disclosure largely verifies the concerns we raised,"" he said in an interview. ""The top two executives don't resign when allegations are meritless.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust watchdog plans to expedite a restarted probe into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart, as it intensifies scrutiny of big-tech firms, two people close to the matter said.
The comments come as major U.S. technology firms including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) are at loggerheads with the government over issues such as data privacy bills and policies some industry executives have called protectionist.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) initiated a probe in January last year on the basis of a complaint alleging Amazon and Flipkart promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and that deep discounts stifled competition.
The companies have denied wrongdoing.
Near-immediate legal challenges from the pair stalled the probe for over a year until a court last week allowed it to resume, having dismissed arguments that the CCI lacked evidence.
Though Amazon and Flipkart are likely to appeal, the CCI plans to demand information from them related to the allegations ""as quickly as possible"", said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The investigation ""will be expedited"", the person said. Such investigations in India typically take months to complete.
Amazon declined to comment. Flipkart and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.
PRIORITY
The CCI is speeding up all cases involving big technology firms, including by deploying additional officers for some cases and working to more stringent internal deadlines, said the two people, who are familiar with the watchdog's thinking.
""Cases involving digital firms are getting a priority at CCI as they can have significant impact on the economy and Indian startups,"" said one of the people.
Last year, the CCI began reviewing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive-idUKKBN26S1M1 allegations of Google abusing the position of its Android operating system in the smart TV market, and is likely to soon order a comprehensive antitrust investigation, the people said.
Google declined to comment.
Such a probe would be the third against Google, with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit already battling cases relating to Android as well as its payment app. 
The CCI is also investigating practices at MakeMyTrip Ltd and privacy policy changes at Facebook's WhatsApp.
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
The probe into Amazon and Flipkart is restarting at a time when both are battling accusations from offline retailers that their complex business structures allow them to circumvent foreign investment rules for e-commerce.
In February, a Reuters investigation http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W based on Amazon documents showed the e-tailer for years gave preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its Indian platform. While arguing to restart the probe, the CCI told a court in Karnataka state that the Reuters report corroborated evidence https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-india-idUSKBN2BB1UF.
Amazon, which has said it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller"", told the court https://www.reuters.com/world/india/amazon-tells-indian-court-reuters-story-is-no-reason-resume-antitrust-probe-2021-04-15 it disagreed with the Reuters report.

The antitrust body will examine the Reuters report and could use it as part of its investigation, one of the people said.
""The CCI's plan to move faster on such cases is in line with other antitrust regulators globally that are investigating digital markets like e-commerce and online search, which are dynamic and evolving fast,"" said an Indian antitrust lawyer who represents tech firms.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Emirates got an additional $1.1 billion in state support from Dubai after a collapse in long-haul travel due to the coronavirus pandemic triggered the airline's first annual loss in more than three decades.
Governments have pumped billions of dollars into airlines to keep them afloat during the pandemic and state-owned Emirates has now received $3.1 billion in equity injections from Dubai, including $2 billion disclosed last year.
The airline reported a $5.5 billion loss on Tuesday for the year ending on March 31, after making a $288 million profit the previous year, as revenue plunged 66% to $8.4 billion.
It was the airline's biggest annual loss, and only its third ever following losses in 1987-88 and 1985-86, its first year in operation, an Emirates representative said. 
Emirates said the government, its sole shareholder, would continue to support the airline that has transformed Dubai into a major international travel hub over the past three decades.
Fellow Gulf carrier Qatar Airways, which is due to report results for its fiscal year ending March 31, has also received $3 billion from its state owner.
Emirates and Qatar Airways have no domestic markets to cushion against border restrictions and closures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19. While vaccination programmes have put some economies on the road to recovery their slow rollout globally has put international airlines at a disadvantage. 
Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the recovery from the pandemic would be patchy, cautioning that no one could predict when the industry's worst crisis would end.
Emirates said it had filled just 44.3% of seats on flights in the past year, down from an average of 78.4% a year earlier. It carried 6.6 million passengers, its lowest in two decades.
The airline cut capacity by 82.6% compared with the previous year as it centred operations around its 146 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777s - 19 of which have been stripped of seats to carry more cargo as the pandemic drastically hit passenger demand.
Most of the airline's 113 Airbus A380s have been grounded. Four more have been removed from operation and are unlikely to return before their scheduled retirement, it said.

Emirates Group, the airline's holding company that includes other aviation and travel assets, saw revenue fall 65.8% to $9.7 billion and it made a loss of $6 billion, its first.
The group's overall workforce shrank by 30.8% to 75,145, with the airline slashing its staff by nearly 20,000 to 40,801, its annual report said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Mizuho Financial Group Inc's corporate culture is to blame for its long history of tech system failures, creating an atmosphere where managers are reluctant to express opinions and unable to respond well to crises, an investigation found.
The damning report was commissioned by Japan's third-largest lender after four system breakdowns between February and March this year, which came despite the bank having spent more than $3.6 billion to overhaul its systems in 2019. That revamp followed two large-scale breakdowns in 2002 and 2011.
The third-party report said Mizuho rotated tech staff too often which prevented the accumulation of knowledge and that managers were too hesitant to question the status quo.
""The atmosphere within the company is one where managers believe the best course is to take the stance that they have done what they are supposed do rather than taking the risk of actively expressing their opinion. This contributes to a lack of positive and proactive action on their part,"" the report said. 
Ten years ago when Mizuho reported system failures, the country's financial watchdog told the bank there was a problem with its culture.
""Our corporate culture hasn't remained the same, but it's also true it would not easily change,"" Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai told a press conference on Tuesday. 
One of the glitches this year affected most of its ATMs, leaving customers unable to retrieve thousands of bank cards and bank books stuck inside in the machines.
""I came to know the ATMs breakdown through internet news,"" Koji Fujiwara, the head of Mizuho's main banking unit, told reporters, highlighting how Mizuho was slow to share information with its management.
Mizuho said it would set up an internal committee to prevent recurrences and plans to recruit executives from tech companies to improve know-how.
Sakai will have his pay halved for six months to take responsibility for the problems, while Fujiwara will take a 50% pay cut for four months.
""We, as a whole organization, strongly recognise it's necessary to take fundamental preventive measures in order not to let such issues happen again,"" Mizuho said in a statement.
Mizuho did not, however, announce Fujiwara's resignation which had been flagged by domestic media.
The report was compiled by a four member team led by lawyer Shuji Iwamura and also including another lawyer, a former Fair Trade Commission official and a former NTT DoCoMo executive.

Mizuho's shares closed up 0.4%.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>","UK watchdog looking into Apple, Google's dominance of mobile phone systems","LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's competition watchdog said it would investigate whether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance of mobile phone operating systems, app stores and web browsers hurt consumers, launching its latest probe into the tech giants.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it would undertake a ""market study"" into the matter to see whether the pair's effective duopoly was stifling competition and ripping off consumers, or hurting businesses like app developers. 
Governments around the world are looking at strengthening the regulation of U.S. tech giants that have become even more powerful during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are multiple investigations globally into their market positions including in the United States and the European Union.
Britain is setting up a dedicated unit within the CMA to keep the tech giants in check and encourage digital competition but said it needed to start work probing iPhone maker Apple and the Google-powered Android system as soon as possible.
""Our ongoing work into big tech has already uncovered some worrying trends and we know consumers and businesses could be harmed if they go unchecked,"" CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement on Tuesday. 

The CMA said the new study into mobile ecosystems would be broader than some of the other competition probes it already has into Apple's App Store and Google's Privacy Sandbox.
Last year, the CMA concluded an investigation into digital advertising, concluding that Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have developed unassailable market positions, with the two accounting for nearly 80% of UK's digital advertising spend. It recommended regulatory changes as a result.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) were up in Tuesday’s premarket a day after the company guided for a “modestly positive” EBITDA in the ongoing second quarter.
Spirit had posted an adjusted non-GAAP negative EBITDA of $199.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 as airline traffic remained below par because of the pandemic.
The positive outlook won an upgrade from Citi to a buy. The brokerage sees the airline at $42, a 23.5% upside from its closing of $34 on Monday.
Spirit said its plant load factor for the current quarter will be about 84%, in line with the performance achieved in second quarter of 2019, a pre-COVID era.
The company expects air travel demand to continue to gradually recover in 2021.
According to Citi analyst Stephen Trent, even ignoring the forecast adjustments, shares looked attractive after an 8% decline since March."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, remaining near record levels, ahead of the start of the latest two-day Federal Reserve meeting. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 20 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures traded 1 points, or less than 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 5 points, or less than 0.1%.
The broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs Monday, gaining 0.2% and 0.7% respectively, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%.
The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting starts later Tuesday, and while the central bank is not expected to take any action this time round it could hint at its future tapering plans given the recent surge in consumer prices.
Also due for release Tuesday is the producer price index for May, a particularly relevant number given the focus upon inflation. Year-over-year, the PPI is expected to have spiked by 6.3%, the largest increase since the agency started tracking the data in 2010. It had jumped 6.2% on a yearly basis in April. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been “effectively stockpiling” cash, the bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday during a conference, rather than using it to buy Treasuries or other investments because of the possibility higher inflation will force the Fed to boost interest rates.
Retail sales in May are expected to dip 0.7% for the month after being flat previously, while industrial production is seen rising 0.6% on the month, and will be closely watched amid issues over supply constraints and labor market shortages. 
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA), as well as Airbus (PA:AIR), is likely to be in the spotlight with the European Union and the United States on the verge of announcing a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) will also be in focus after the drug maker’s study testing a treatment for a rare eye disease failed to meet its target, while tech company Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is set to release its quarterly results in what is a generally quiet week for earnings.
Crude oil prices headed higher Tuesday, remaining near multi-year highs, as the immediate threat of additional supply from Iran returning to the market dwindled.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.5% at $71.23 a barrel, not far below the highest level since October 2018, while Brent was up 0.5% at $73.21, around its highest since May 2019. 
Crude markets have posted gains of over 40% this year to date, even while ongoing discussions between Iran and world powers, including the U.S., to revive a 2015 nuclear deal take place. A successful conclusion could allow the Persian Gulf country to resume crude exports, potentially adding up to two million barrels of crude a day to the global market.
However, such a deal is looking unlikely before Friday’s Iranian presidential elections. The front-runner is Ebrahim Raisi, an implacable critic of the West who was sanctioned by the United States in 2019 for human rights violations.
Elsewhere, gold futures was largely flat at $1,866.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2125.

Airbus shares were up 1% in Paris.
The subsidies made it difficult for both to land contracts from airlines based in each other’s territories.
The deal, while bringing peace between the two sides, will also help them focus on their emerging rival, China’s state-sponsored Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China or Comac.

LONDON (Reuters) -Jaguar Land Rover will begin tests later this year on a hydrogen fuel-cell prototype model based on its Land Rover Defender vehicle as the carmaker looks to expand its zero-emission car options, the company said on Tuesday.
JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), earlier this year said that its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025, and the more rugged, off-road Land Rover brand will launch six pure electric models over the next five years.
Most of the auto industry is focusing its efforts on developing battery-electric cars to meet tightening emission standards in Europe and China.
But JLR is one of a small number of carmakers that sees possibilities for the mass adoption of hydrogen fuel cells, which emit only water as they produce electricity, and has said it believes hydrogen has a future role in the auto industry.
Hydrogen fuel cells ""provide high energy density and rapid refuelling, and minimal loss of range in low temperatures, making the technology ideal for larger, longer-range vehicles, or those operated in hot or cold environments,"" JLR said.
The hydrogen Land Rover Defender will undergo tests to ""verify key attributes such as off-road capability and fuel consumption,"" the company said in a release.
As well as offering the prospect of harmless emissions, hydrogen fuel cells also provide greater range than battery-electric cars. But there is little fuelling infrastructure currently in place to support mass adoption of the technology.
German carmaker BMW plans a limited series hydrogen fuel cell model SUV in 2022 as it continues to research zero-emission alternatives to battery-electric cars.

In December, Japanese carmaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp unveiled its revamped Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car, in a fresh push to promote the zero-emission technology amid rapidly growing demand for electric vehicles.
Japan's Honda Motor Co and South Korea's Hyundai Motor have developed fuel-cell models.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's trade minister said on Tuesday he was not planning to order up a probe into allegations made by an independent investigation that his ministry helped Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp lean on foreign shareholders.
Hiroshi Kajiyama, head of the Ministry for Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), also said it was normal for the government to deal with individual companies when matters of national security are at stake.
""We merely implemented policies that were natural for METI,"" he told a regular post-cabinet news conference.
A shareholder-commissioned independent investigation last week alleged Toshiba management colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block foreign investors from gaining board influence, in what one Toshiba shareholder has called the world's worst corporate scandal in a decade.
The damning report has renewed concerns about corporate governance at Toshiba as well as Japan more broadly, though some investors have also said the successful push for the probe by activist shareholders and the report's vindication of their assertions represents progress.
Kajiyama said, however, that he saw the report as an internal Toshiba investigation and did not think the report was all true.
Toshiba's businesses include defence-related work such as submarine batteries and radars and it also builds nuclear reactors, making it strategically important to the government.
Reuters has previously reported Harvard University's endowment fund had been told by Hiromichi Mizuno, a METI adviser at the time, that it could be subject to a regulatory probe if the fund did not follow management's recommendations for board nominees at Toshiba's AGM last July.
The Harvard fund subsequently abstained from voting.
The investigators' report said Toshiba, working in unison with the trade ministry, ""effectively asked"" a government adviser, described as ""Mr. M"", to negotiate with the Harvard fund to change its voting behaviour.
Mizuno has not responded to requests for comment. Kajiyama said last week that he had been told by ministry officials that it was not true that any request was made to engage with individual investors.

The probe also found that Toshiba, with the ministry, tried to force Toshiba's top shareholder, Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, to withdraw shareholder proposals for board nominees aimed at improving governance. 
In the wake of the report, Toshiba has said two board members will not be standing for re-election although Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama on Monday resisted calls to step down.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -H&M's sales jumped from March to May compared to a year earlier as pandemic restrictions eased in many markets and online demand stayed strong but revenue was still well below 2019 levels. 
The world's second-biggest fashion retailer said on Tuesday sales were up 62% year on year in the period - its fiscal second quarter - or 75% measured in local currencies, to 46.5 billion crowns ($5.59 billion). 
Compared with two years earlier, sales were still down 19% as stores stayed closed for most of the quarter in Germany and France, and as footfall was slow in many stores that were open.
""As more people are vaccinated a number of markets have gradually allowed stores to reopen and the H&M group's strong recovery continues,"" the company said in a statement.
""Online sales have continued to develop very well, even as the stores have opened. This shows that customers appreciate the collections and being able to shop via their preferred channel."" 
In the same quarter a year earlier, the measures to tackle the pandemic meants much global trade and retail activity ground to a near halt, with about 4,000 of the Swedish group's 5,000 stores temporarily closed. 
H&M said local-currency sales in the first half of June were up 35% on the year and up 2% from the same period of 2019.
Market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, and smaller rival Next, have also reported recovering sales on the back of easing restrictions.
Analysts at JP Morgan said H&M's quarterly sales matched local currency expectations but said the early June reading indicated a slower recent recovery pace for H&M than for Inditex which is less exposed to Germany. 
H&M's shares were down 1% at 0730 GMT, taking a year-to-date rise to 21%, while the wider market in Stockholm was slightly up.
Inditex said last week that sales in May and early June were higher than two years earlier, as it reported forecast-beating February-April profits.
H&M, publishes full quarterly earnings on July 1, said about 180 stores were closed on June 13, down from 1,300 at the start of March but up from 140 at the end of May.

RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, who has an 'outperform' rating on H&M's shares, predicted H&M's profits would recover faster than the overall market from the second half of the year.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>","GE, Safran venture to develop radical new jet engine","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -General Electric and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) has unveiled plans to test-build an open-bladed jet engine able to reduce fuel use and emissions by 20% as they prolonged their historic CFM International joint venture by a decade to 2050.
The ""RISE"" engine, positioned as a possible successor to the ""LEAP"" model used on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and some Airbus A320neo, will feature a design with visible fan blades known as open-rotor and could enter service by the mid-2030s.
The system will contain hybrid-electric propulsion and be capable of running on 100% sustainable fuel or hydrogen, an energy source favoured by Airbus for future concepts.
CFM is the world's largest jet engine maker by the number of units sold. It is the sole engine supplier for the Boeing 737 MAX and competes with Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) unit Pratt & Whitney for airline engine selections on the Airbus A320neo.
The technology demonstrator project comes as the industry prepares to battle over the next generation of single-aisle planes like the MAX and A320neo in the busiest part of the airplane market while facing mounting environmental pressure.
Industry sources have said Boeing is considering launching a replacement for its slightly larger and long-range single-aisle 757 that could pave the way for a replacement of the MAX.
But it has deferred a decision on whether to move relatively quickly - a step that would require an available conventional engine - or wait for the arrival of technology like open-rotor with hybrid propulsion, Reuters reported recently.
GE Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery said CFM would be ready to compete for whatever jet might be launched and challenged other engine makers to compete with the technology.
""If Boeing or any airframer launches a platform and the business case makes sense for us, then we will present our best aggregate technologies that we have at that moment in time,"" he told a news conference on Monday.
Boeing said it regularly conducted technology studies and collaborated with suppliers. It gave no fresh indication whether open-rotor technology could power its next jetliner. 
Airbus, which says it is working on a zero-emission plane to enter service in 2035, said on Tuesday it welcomed the fact that the engine was expected to be ""agnostic"" about the type of fuel.
""We await news of where Airbus and Boeing are headed,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris said.
Safran shares rose 1.6% early on Tuesday, buoyed also by signs of a truce in an aircraft trade war.
SUMMIT BIRTH
The open-rotor engine concept places previously hidden whirring parts on the outside of the engine to capture more air and reduce the burden on the engine's fuel-burning core.
Previous attempts since the 1980s to develop such engines have had to contend with concerns including noise.
Safran Chief Executive Olivier Andries said a prototype tested in 2017 had produced no more noise than the LEAP.
""I am very confident we will meet the most stringent noise regulations ... and safety requirements,"" he told Reuters.
All eyes are now on rivals led by Pratt & Whitney, which is expected to give updates on its geared turbofan later this year. 
""We are committed to continued investment in evolving propulsion systems to power the next generation of commercial aircraft,"" Pratt & Whitney said.
Founded in 1974, CFM saw the light of day after a summit deal between U.S. President Richard Nixon and French counterpart Georges Pompidou, following attempts by the Pentagon to block it on the grounds that its engine was related to the B-1 bomber.
Under a compromise, French engineers were banned at first from looking inside the sealed casing of the original CFM core.

Although such restrictions vanished long ago, GE and Safran still maintain an unusual Chinese Wall between them over costs on the world’s most-sold jet engines to avoid disputes.
""One of the ingredients of CFM's success is that we share the revenues; we don't share the costs. If one of us is not competitive, it doesn't reflect on the (other) partner. Everyone is fully responsible,"" Andries said.

Boohoo, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products aimed at 16 to 40-year olds, said revenue rose 32% to 486.1 million pounds ($686.8 million) in the three months to May 31 compared to the same period last year.
""I am delighted with our performance in the first quarter, particularly as it was always going to be challenging to produce strong growth rates on last year, when lockdowns around the globe drove such high traffic to online retailers,"" Chief Executive John Lyttle said.
Shares in the group were down 0.5% at 0724 GMT, extending year-on-year losses to 12% and giving the group a market capitalistion of 4.1 billion pounds.
In September, Boohoo accepted all the recommendations of an independent review that found major failings in its supply chain in England after newspaper allegations about working conditions and low pay in factories in the Leicester area.
The group pledged to fix the problems with its 'Agenda for Change' programme and in March revealed a major consolidation in its list of British suppliers.
Boohoo reported on the programme on Tuesday, saying it had made ""excellent progress"". It said it was on track to publish a global supplier list in September and continued to review its manufacturing supplier base.
Some shareholder advisory groups remain dissatisfied.
Glass Lewis has recommended investors vote against the reappointment to the board of Boohoo co-founder Carol Kane at Friday's annual general meeting, amid concerns over governance and high pay. It has also recommended investors vote against Boohoo's remuneration report.
In January, Boohoo purchased the Debenhams brand out of administration for 55 million pounds and in February bought the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from the administrators of Arcadia for 25.2 million pounds.
Boohoo said the former Arcadia brands had been successfully integrated into its multi-brand business, adding that a new Debenhams online department store had been launched.

Boohoo maintained its guidance for full year 2021-2022 revenue growth of about 25%, with an overall core earnings (EBITDA) margin of 9.5-10%.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's Lufthansa has laid out plans to return to profitability as a leaner, more thinly-staffed airline with fewer planes after the pandemic, while banking on a capital increase to help it repay state aid.
Lufthansa was pushed to the brink by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when travel restrictions led to a collapse in air travel, forcing it to take 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in aid from Germany and its other home countries.
""Lufthansa Group is determined to accelerate its transformation in order to come out of the crisis stronger,"" Germany's largest airline said in a statement late on Monday.
Lufthansa said it aims to have an adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin of at least 8% and an adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) of at least 10% in 2024. Its adjusted ROCE was –16.7% in 2020 and 6.6% in 2019. 
The airline said it aimed to cut costs by 3.5 billion euros by 2024 compared to 2019, the last year before the pandemic.
The plans envisage a fleet that will be 20% smaller but more efficient, and a 1.8 billion euro reduction in staff costs.
Investors greeted the plan with caution, with shares up little over 1% in pre-market trading on Tuesday.
""Lufthansa ... has presented the most comprehensive and long-term outlook of any European airline to date,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska.
""We expect investors to greet today's plan with an ounce of caution given the high dependency on labor cost reduction in the plan,"" Roeska added.
Germany, which owns 20% of the company after last year's bail-out, will have to consent to the capital-raising plan, the full details of which have not yet been published.

At Lufthansa's last general meeting in May, shareholders gave approval for it to raise up to 5 billion euros in capital in order to help repay the state aid. The company said at the time that it would not need the full amount.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thai Airways International Pcl won court approval on Tuesday for restructuring its $12.9 billion debt load as the airline that is already under bankruptcy protection seeks to turn around its fortunes.
The court ruling removes the last hurdle to the implementation of the plan, seen as critical for the carrier which last year posted a record loss of about $4.5 billion.
The Central Bankruptcy Court in Bangkok said in its order it approved the rehabilitation plan. The court did not make any changes to the plan that was previously approved by creditors.
A hearing was postponed after two complaints were filed against the plan by certain creditors.
""We are satisfied with the decision,"" Somboon Sangrungjang of law firm Kudun and Partners, which represents 87 saving cooperatives, told Reuters. 
The plan covers the airline's debt of 400 billion baht ($12.86 billion), he said.
A committee of five, including the airline's acting chief executive Chansin Treenuchagron and its former CEO, Piyasvasti Amranand, will administer the plan. 
Piyasvasti helmed the airline the last time it was profitable in 2009 to 2012. 
The airline was in difficulty well before the coronavirus pandemic grounded many flights across the globe, booking losses nearly every year after 2012.
The restructuring plan, which relies heavily on debt extensions and debt-to-equity conversions, limits most of the haircuts to late interest payments.
The carrier said in March it plans reduce its fleet size to 86 jets by 2025 from the current 103. Thai Airways says it has cut 30 billion baht in expenses.
The Thai government holds a 47.86% stake in the carrier, but it is not governed by the country's state-enterprise law. 
Thai Airways is due to hold a news conference later on Tuesday.

The airline this month resumed routes between European cities and the resort island of Phuket in Thailand in anticipation of a government scheme to allow vaccinated tourists to skip a mandatory quarantine.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 01:25AM ET</span>","After 17 years, truce nears in U.S.-Europe jet subsidy war","By Tim Hepher, Andrea Shalal, David Shepardson and Philip Blenkinsop
(Reuters) -The United States and Europe are expected to announce a five-year suspension of tariffs in their 17-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Tuesday, allowing them to focus on the threat posed by China's nascent commercial aircraft industry, people familiar with the matter said.
A deal to pause the world's largest corporate trade dispute would help U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Europe's Airbus, while granting relief to dozens of other industries affected by tit-for-tat tariffs that were suspended in March. They face a renewed trade war within weeks if there is no progress.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai discussed the dispute in her first face-to-face meeting with EU counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis on Monday ahead of Tuesday's U.S.-EU summit, where China will also be a key topic. Tai travels to Britain on Wednesday.
The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, and the United States had vowed to find a solution by July 11 when the currently suspended transatlantic tariffs are due to resume.
Officials had targeted a permanent solution through a pair of treaties - one between the United States and European Union, the original parties, and another between Washington and London following Britain's exit from the EU - on new ground rules for aerospace.
But reaching a detailed accord has proven complex, given nearly two decades of legal wrangling and thousands of pages of documents, said one source briefed on the talks. 
A standstill agreement would push back the resumption of tariffs by years at a time when U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed to reset relations with European partners after four tumultuous years under former President Donald Trump. 
Freezing the conflict over jet subsides, some of which have been rescinded or wound down, would give both sides more time to focus on broader agendas such as concerns over China's state-driven economic model, several of the sources said.
The tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods were progressively imposed from 2019 after the United States and EU both won partial victories at the World Trade Organization over claims of unfair aid for Boeing and Airbus.
The dispute has dragged on since 2004 when the United States withdrew from a 1992 aircraft subsidy pact and took the EU to the WTO, claiming Airbus had managed to equal Boeing's share of the jet market thanks in part to subsidized government loans.
The EU counter-sued over what it termed unfair R&D support and subsidized tax incentives for Boeing.
In recent months, top European, British and U.S. officials have engaged in intense discussions to settle the dispute and focus on other challenges, including China.
CHINA 'ON RADAR'
Tai told Reuters in May she was optimistic about reaching a deal with Brussels, adding that the two sides needed to look at ""the bigger question"" of China's ambitions to become a global player in the commercial aircraft industry.
The U.S. has floated a joint review of aerospace funding in non-market economies like China, two of the people said.
One of the sources said the two sides had agreed to increase information-sharing, but gave no further details.
""There's no question that the rise of China's aircraft industry is ... on everybody's proverbial radar,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice-President Marjorie Chorlins told reporters on Monday, noting what she described as China's ""heavy subsidization"" of its industries.
She said settling the dispute would provide ""a tremendous boost of goodwill"" for broader U.S.-European ties. 
Brussels and Washington remain at odds over steel and aluminum tariffs, but are expected at Tuesday's summit to set a Dec. 1 deadline to end punitive tariffs related to the dispute, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters.
Like the United States, the EU has sparred with Beijing on trade and security this year. But its 27 nations could struggle to agree a common front on topics like aerospace.
In April, for example, Hungary blocked an EU statement criticizing China's new Hong Kong security law, sparking a row over the right of member states to veto EU foreign policy.
The Chinese embassy in Washington had no immediate comment.
None of the parties agreed to comment on the talks.
HURDLES TO PERMANENT AGREEMENT
In a potentially key breakthrough, the United States had watered down opposition to the principle of future public loans for Airbus and removed its demand for compensation.
But its insistence on advance notice of any future public loans had triggered concerns among EU officials, who rejected giving Washington any veto power, people familiar with the talks said. 
Even more critical is the benchmark to be used when deciding whether the interest on any future loans is market-compatible. 
Under the 1992 subsidy pact, one third of a project could be financed by direct government support such as loans and cleared indirect R&D support up to 4% of a company's revenue.
One option is to revisit that framework with market rules replacing subsidy quotas and a new cap on indirect R&D support.
Brexit has also complicated negotiations.
Britain and the United States came close to striking an aerospace agreement in December that could have forced the hand of Brussels in its own talks with Washington.

Britain's ability to negotiate trade deals independently of the EU is central to its new ""global Britain"" stance. But its flexibility on Airbus is cramped by its role as one of four core nations involved in the planemaker, pre-dating its EU accession.
Airbus, which has 14,000 staff in Britain, has made plain work could shift abroad if the UK turns its back on aerospace.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's stock market is set for another delisting, raising a question mark over the future of one of the Gulf's major exchanges, which was launched two decades ago.
A $595 million bid to take DAMAC Properties private by the firm's founder Hussain Sajwani is the latest blow to the exchange, even as the Gulf city state's property market showed signs of life in the first quarter.
""It is not that Dubai is becoming less attractive. Alternatives are becoming more attractive,"" Khaled Abdel Majeed, founder at London-based Mena Capital LLP, told Reuters.
Majeed said Dubai needs to work harder to attract listings amid growing competition from within the Gulf region such as Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia where Tadawul, the region's biggest exchange based on market value, wants to become a regional hub.
While the value of traded stocks in Dubai was once higher than rival Abu Dhabi, this changed in 2019 and ADX now has a more than four times higher average daily traded value.
ADX has also seen gains after its owner, ADQ, launched a market maker last year that tapped into a fund to boost liquidity on the bourse. 
""It's disappointing from a market point of view that you have companies de-listing ... at a time when we think the market needs added depth, more companies, which has not been happening since 2014-2015,"" Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital in Abu Dhabi, said of the Dubai stock market.
Since the start of 2020, two prominent Dubai companies have de-listed from the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Nasdaq Dubai: Dubai parks operator DXB Entertainments and Dubai ports operator DP World. 
And shares in Arabtec, once a high-flying Dubai construction company, were suspended in September after its shareholders voted to dissolve company.
Emaar Malls, operator and owner of the world's largest shopping centre, in March said it planned to offer to buy out minority shareholders and merge with Emaar Properties.
And Dubai real estate fund Emirates REIT, which is listed on the Nasdaq Dubai exchange, said in July it was considering de-listing.
Where Abu Dhabi is boosting liquidity through planned new listings and consolidation of assets of state holding company ADQ, Dubai appears to have become more tolerant of delistings, a Gulf M&A banker told Reuters. Analysts say the move to de-list spares companies having to face scrutiny from investors, along with the running costs of a listing and disclosure and transparency requirements.
""If someone wants to take (their company) private; this is the time,"" the M&A banker said.
Asked what steps, if any, it was taking to ensure that listed companies remained on the exchange and that it attracted new listings, the DFM declined to comment 
Graphic: Value of stocks traded in Dubai versus Abu Dhabi: https://graphics.reuters.com/EMIRATES-DUBAI/DELISTING/azgpoolqwpd/chart.png 
The problem for listed Dubai real estate companies is that they are trading at a discount to the average price to earnings of the wider market, at around 8 times earnings, while the market is trading at around 20 times that.
""For DAMAC, I'm sure that the strategic investor, Hussain Sajwani, understands that the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the share price, Tariq Qaqish, chief executive of Salt Fund Placement in Dubai, said.
The two years leading to the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of Dubai's homebuilders and property companies, said Samer Haydar, director of corporate ratings at Fitch.

And despite signs of recovery, many are ""still facing the aftermath of the pandemic in terms of negative working capital, rising leverage, weak liquidity and overall un-absorbed supply in the market,"" Haydar said.

The Fed is due to hand down its latest policy decision on Wednesday. Investors will be looking for any clues from the central bank on its timetable to begin asset tapering. However, it is widely expected that the Fed’s decision will keep the rate of bond purchases even as it delivers a forecast for interest rate hikes in 2023.
“We’re in a tug-of-war between the understanding that we’re having great economic growth and great earnings growth juxtaposed with the fact that we need to get our head wrapped around what inflation looks like and what it will mean both to profit margins and to the Fed,” National Securities chief strategist Art Hogan told Bloomberg.
The Fed is one of several central banks handing down their policy decisions throughout the week. The Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday, with the Bank of Japan following on Friday.
Ahead of the Fed policy decision, investors await a slew of data, including the producer price index, retail sales and industrial production, due later in the day, for further clues into the U.S. economy’s health.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will also testify on the federal budget before Thursday’s House of Representatives panel.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing the dominant on-campus bookstore chains and college textbook publishers of conspiring to eliminate competition and raise prices by using agreements to sell course materials online, known as ""Inclusive Access.""
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan rejected claims by undergraduate and graduate students, independent bookstores and online textbook sellers against Barnes & Noble Education (NYSE:BNED), Follett Higher Education Group, and the publishers Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill and Pearson Education.
Inclusive Access requires students to buy one-time access codes for purchases of online textbooks, which typically cost less than new hardcopy textbooks but more than used textbooks.
The defendants were accused of using the program to monopolize the more than $3 billion annual market for new textbooks, boosting prices for hundreds of thousands of students while suppressing demand for used textbooks.
In two decisions totaling 94 pages, Cote said none of the proposed classes of plaintiffs showed a conspiracy to suppress competition, though some defendants might have joined Inclusive Access because it was innovative or served their financial interests.
She also said the independent bookstores and online textbook sellers lacked standing to sue because it was the adoption by hundreds of colleges and universities of digital textbooks, rather than the defendants' conduct, that hurt their sales.
""Any injury to the plaintiffs is due to the institutions selecting brick-and-mortar retailers other than the plaintiffs as their on-campus bookstores,"" the judge wrote.

Lawyers for the students did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bruce Steckler, a lawyer for the independent bookstores and online sellers, declined to comment.

The latest proposal from Oaktree is for a A$2 billion private loan and a A$1.1 billion loan convertible into new shares to be issued by Crown, the company said in a statement. 
Oaktree's offer is slightly higher than the A$3 billion in funding it offered in April to help Crown buy back James Packer's 37% stake.
Australian casino operator Star Entertainment Group had offered an all-stock buyout of the troubled company valued at A$9 billion, while rival buyout giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) upped its all-cash indicative bid to A$8.4 billion.
Billionaire Packer's status as Crown's major shareholder has been under scrutiny ever since an inquiry named his influence as a reason for declaring the company unfit for a Sydney casino licence in February, citing activities including money laundering.
According to the terms for the convertible loan, the number of new Crown shares to be issued to Oaktree on conversion would be capped at a 10% stake in Crown.
Oaktree could convert the A$1.1 billion loan into new Crown shares at A$13 per share under some specified circumstances, including after the first year of the facility, provided shares trade above that amount, the company said. Crown's shares last closed at A$12.220. 

Crown said it had yet not decided on the proposal.

Investors are seeking new cues from the central bank on its inflation outlook, after recent data indicated the U.S. economy is regaining momentum but not overheating. This has eased investor worries about inflation.
While the Fed has reassured that any spike in inflation would be transitory, policymakers could begin discussing the tapering of bond buying at the Tuesday-Wednesday meeting. Most analysts, however, do not expect a decision before the central bank's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference in August.
Any shift in the Fed's dovish rhetoric could upend equity markets. The S&P benchmark has climbed 13.1% this year, while the Dow and the Nasdaq have risen 12.7% and 9.2%, respectively.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The co-founder of a Florida financial firm facing investor lawsuits alleging securities fraud has died by suicide, and a spokesperson on Monday denied wrongdoing, saying the death was not connected to a class action lawsuit filed last week.
Eric Holtz, the 54-year-old co-founder of the Seeman Holtz Family of Companies in Boca Raton, took his own life on Friday in California, the company spokesperson confirmed.
Lawsuits claim that Holtz, business partner Marshal Seeman and their insurance and financial firm defrauded elderly investors in South Florida using life insurance policy-backed notes.
The most recent, a class action filed June 7 in South Florida federal court on behalf of 76-year-old Broward County resident Fanny Millstein, alleges the firm sold securities without proper licenses or external controls, resulting in unreturned funds.
The Seeman Holtz spokesperson said that the company had only learned of this lawsuit on Monday. ""We deny any allegations of wrongdoing and believe this case is without merit,"" he wrote.
""There is no indication that Eric's tragic passing is in any way related to this filing,"" he added.
The Seeman Holtz investment notes, which the firm called “longevity linked assets,” were described as collateralized by life insurance policies issued to third parties that promised to pay a ""substantial premium"" upon the death of the insured, according to the class action.
The notes were sold as safe and easy to cash out of at maturity, according to the lawsuit. But Millstein was told that the firm was undergoing “financial problems” and needed more time to return her money, which never happened, according to the class action.
“The effects have been devastating for Plaintiff. At age 76, Fanny Millstein should not be forced to contemplate that her and her husband’s life savings invested with Seeman Holtz have vanished,” the lawsuit said.
Attorney Scott Silver, who represents plaintiffs in the class action, said his team had spoken to nearly 100 investors with similar experiences. They represent more than $100 million invested in the Seeman Holtz securities, and Silver believes the actual dollar amount is far greater.
The lawsuit said the firm has been ""unwilling or unable"" to provide information about the value of the notes or the assets.
The new class action follows similar pending lawsuits filed earlier this year by Silver and other attorneys in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. The Seeman Holtz spokesperson said the company also denies the allegations in those lawsuits.

The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the FTC currently divide up the work of antitrust enforcement, with the FCC weighing in on telecommunications deals.
There is no companion legislation in the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats control the evenly divided Senate because of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
The measure, introduced by Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lee, the top Republican on the committee's antitrust panel, would also ban any merger that results in a market share of more than 66 percent unless needed to prevent ""serious harm"" to the U.S. economy, according to a summary.
Lee said that the bill - which has a long list of elements - would address concerns beyond Big Tech, which has been the focus of other legislation. {nL2N2NT1VQ]
""We need a holistic approach that deals with all of these concerns, and that benefits all consumers, in every industry – without massively increasing regulation and imposing a command-and-control grip over the economy,"" he said in a statement.
The bill would increase the budget of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division to $600 million. That is sharply higher than the Biden administration proposal for the next fiscal year that would give the FTC $389.8 million and the Antitrust Division $201 million.

The measure would also raise fees charged by the government to assess whether the largest mergers are legal under antitrust law.

(Reuters) -Avenue Therapeutics Inc said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve its intravenous formulation of painkiller tramadol for a second time, sending its shares tumbling about 38%.
The health regulator in October declined to approve the intravenous formulation of the painkiller, stating it was not safe for the intended population.
The agency said on Monday the delayed and unpredictable onset of analgesia - relief from pain - with intravenous (IV) tramadol did not support its benefit as a monotherapy to treat patients with acute pain.
There was also insufficient data to support that IV tramadol was safe and effective in combination with other drugs, FDA said in its decision that came in more than two months after the scheduled date of April 12.
H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis, however, says that IV tramadol could still have a path forward.

The FDA did not mention any ""chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC)"" issues in its complete response letter, Avenue said, adding that it disagreed with the agency's decision and would continue to seek regulatory approval for IV tramadol.
Tramadol was approved in the United States in 1995 as a non-controlled analgesic, under the trade name of Ultram, to be sold by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

""If you want to get paid in New York, you need to be in New York,"" CEO James Gorman, speaking from the bank's offices at 1585 Broadway, told analysts and investors during a virtual conference.
Like the rest of Wall Street, most of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s nearly 70,000 employees worked remotely during the pandemic. But in recent weeks, rival banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have begun to bring employees back to U.S. offices on a rotational basis.
Gorman said his bank's policy will vary by location, noting the firm's 2,000 employees in India will not return to offices this year. As of Monday, India has reported more than 29 million cases of COVID-19.
During the wide-ranging conversation, Gorman said the bank's revenues in the second quarter ""look good"" and that it will ""likely"" make another acquisition in its wealth management business. 
On the bank's recent leadership changes, Gorman said he does not plan to step down from the CEO job for several years but that he now has four or five people who could replace him if needed.
Gorman also talked about the internal review the bank conducted after the meltdown of investing firm Archegos Capital Management, which resulted in Morgan Stanley losing $911 million earlier this year.

Morgan Stanley reviewed all large, single-name margin positions backed by the bank, Gorman said, and found nothing concerning. 
A client of Morgan Stanley and several other banks, Archegos faced the biggest margin call in history when it amassed significant holdings of one stock, which suddenly lost value.

And despite a recent meme stock rally, current macroeconomic trends are unlikely to motivate retail traders to continue rewarding overvalued Reddit stocks Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Clover Health (CLOV), and Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN). Given their weak fundamentals, we think these stocks are best avoided now. Read on.The meme craze has returned over the past few weeks. With approximately 10.40 million users in the popular Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, many highly discussed stocks could skyrocket like Gamestop, Inc. (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). However, while the GME and AMC rallies were essentially a consequence of short squeezes, that's not the case with many stocks this time around. One thing is clear from the meme trends so far, however: social media hype is the only reason for their rallies, and they may or may not have much short interest.
However, rising inflation level makes the market highly susceptible to a pullback in the near term. So, with that, investors are opting for value stocks over growth stocks to ensure sustainable returns in the long run. Therefore, meme stocks that have already relied to become overvalued now may not be able to gain further on investor interest.
Reddit stocks Tilray, Inc. (TLRY), Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV), and Ocugen, Inc. (OCGN), which are currently trading at high valuations, are examples of Reddit stocks that we think could retreat in the near-term. So, obviously, they are best avoided now.

COPPA gave parents control over the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children, but it did nothing to prevent kids from viewing inappropriate content. While the Internet can be used to help educate and inform, it is also cluttered with celebrity gossip, conspiracy stories and viral memes that are clearly meant for adult consumption.

(Reuters) - NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Monday that the upcoming Tokyo Games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC’s history.
“I think we're pretty optimistic about both the ratings and the economics of the Olympics and advertisers have embraced it,” Shell said at Credit Suisse’s virtual Communications Conference.
Every Olympics has an issue that people worry about in the run up to the Games, Shell said.
""I lived in London: everybody was worried about the traffic. And last time it was Zika, and then once the Opening Ceremony happens, everybody forgets all that and enjoys the 17 days. And I think this is going to be the same thing,” he said.
In March 2020, NBCUniversal said it had sold more than $1.25 billion in national advertising for the Tokyo Olympics, a record for any broadcaster for the event. Organizers later rescheduled the Games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NBCUniversal has not made public an updated advertising sales figure. 
Shell on Monday said the company had officially completed its advertising sales “upfront,” which he said was the strongest in the history of NBCUniversal.
On June 7, the company said it will air an ""unprecedented"" 7,000 hours of coverage for the Tokyo Games across its multiple television networks and streaming platform Peacock.

Most of the Japanese public oppose holding the Olympics as the country struggles through another wave of COVID-19 amid a slow vaccination rollout. But half believe the Tokyo Olympics will still take place this summer, according to a survey released June 7.
NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), paid $7.65 billion to extend its U.S. broadcast rights for the Olympics through 2032.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday they are pushing ahead with developing flying cars, with the South Korean company expressing optimism it could have an air-taxi service in operation as soon as 2025.
A GM executive said it could take until 2030 for air-taxi services to overcome technical and regulatory hurdles and reach commercialization.
The zero-emissions aircraft, which take off and land like helicopters and carry passengers and cargo, are being developed by a number of startups as well as aircraft makers and automakers, but they face a long road to profitability. 
Hyundai is ahead of its previously stated timetable for rolling out air-mobility vehicles, Jose Munoz, the company's global chief operating officer, said in an interview broadcast on Monday at the Reuters Events Car of the Future conference. 
Munoz, who is also CEO of Hyundai North America, previously said urban air taxis would be in operation at major U.S. airports by 2028 and perhaps earlier. He told Reuters on Monday it could possibly happen before 2025.
""We see this market as a significant growth opportunity,"" Munoz said, adding he was ""very confident"" of the technology's development.
Hyundai is developing air taxis powered by electric batteries that can transport five to six people from highly congested urban centers to airports. 
Other automakers developing flying cars either alone or with startups include  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF).
""I think that there's a long pathway here,"" Pamela Fletcher, vice president of GM's Global Innovation team, said at the Reuters event. ""2030 is probably a real commercial inflection point."" 
She added: ""It's a very nascent space. There's a lot of work to be done on the regulatory side, as well as the actual technology side."" 
In January, GM unveiled a flying Cadillac concept. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has estimated the total addressable market for urban air mobility could hit $1 trillion by 2040 and $9 trillion by 2050.
In 2019, Hyundai, which has a dedicated Urban Air Mobility Division led by Jaiwon Shin, a former NASA engineer, pledged to invest about $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025. 

Munoz said Hyundai sees its flying cars serving not only residential customers but also transporting commercial cargo.
Hyundai does not want to sell flying cars as a simple transaction, but believes it can develop services around the vehicles, Munoz said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global stock markets were mixed while U.S. Treasury yields ticked up on Monday, as investors waited for the results of a Federal Reserve policy meeting before making any major new bets.
The continued hope for a rapid economic comeback put wind in the sails of oil markets as investors anticipated surging travel demand, while safe-haven gold dipped.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 85.85 points, or 0.25%. But the S&P 500 gained 7.71 points, or 0.18%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 104.72 points, or 0.74% to close, both record highs for the indices.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 1.37 points, or 0.19%.
Benchmark 10-year yields rose 4 basis points on Monday to 1.50%, mounting a bit of a comeback after falling to a three-month low of 1.43% on Friday. They have dropped from a one-year high of 1.78% in March.
The major market focus is on the upcoming Fed meeting, which will mark the first time the central bank has set policy since a pair of disappointing jobs reports and potential signs of looming inflation. Fed officials have maintained they view recent price increases as ""transitory,"" but the policy update, paired with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's ensuing news conference on Wednesday, will be pored over for signs of when the Fed might begin to pull back unprecedented pandemic stimulus.
""While most market participants don't think that the Fed will officially start to taper bond purchases at Wednesday's meeting, there is a greater chance that the growing consensus within the committee is recognizing that the economy has indeed made substantial progress and delaying removing some accommodation risks fanning inflation and financial instability,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.
Analysts said the central bank will have to tread a fine line, laying out its strategy for exiting extreme accommodation without spooking investors.
Gold prices dipped as investors prepared for a possible Fed exit strategy. Spot gold prices fell $10.6705, or 0.57%, to $1,865.97 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% down at $1,865.9. 
Oil prices ended mostly unchanged Monday, after investors drove prices to their highest levels in over two years in anticipation of surging demand. Brent settled up 17 cents at $72.86 a barrel. Earlier in the session, it reached $73.64 a barrel, its highest since April 2019. U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 3 cents to settle at $70.88 a barrel, after earlier touching $71.78 a barrel, its highest since October 2018. [O/R]
In currencies, the U.S. dollar dipped slightly on Monday after logging its largest weekly change in over a month. 

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.056 point, or 0.06%.
Bitcoin bounced back somewhat after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker could reopen the door to bitcoin transactions in the future. It traded above $40,000 for the first time in more than two weeks, before paring gains to trade at $39,824.03.

As a result, we think major industry players Advanced Micro (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) should benefit significantly in the near- to mid-term. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) are two established companies in the semiconductor industry. AMD develops computing and visualization products. It offers x86 microprocessors as standalone devices or incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, and in discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs). QCOM develops and commercializes wireless industry technologies. It is organized into three segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives.
An exponential increase in demand and limited supply are driving up prices for semiconductors. The demand is increasing primarily from the electronics and automotive sectors. This, combined with the huge government and private investments to increase the supply of semiconductors, should drive the industry’s growth.
Investors’ growing interest in this space is evident in iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 70.5% returns over the past year. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2028.

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered as investors await word from the Federal Reserve later this week on the direction of its monetary policy.
After hitting all-time highs, the S&P 500 slipped on concerns the Fed could start talking about cutting back on its bond buying at some point in the near future after evidence of an uptick in inflation.
Fed officials have said they believe higher prices are transitory as the U.S. economy tries to come back from the pandemic, though some analysts say the pressure is rising on the central bank. Treasury yields have been falling in recent days.
Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC on Monday that if the Fed doesn't acknowledge the recent jump in inflation, it would be the ""green light to go heavy on the inflation trade,” such as gold, bitcoin and cash.
Despite a jump in oil prices to more than two-year highs, energy stocks failed to capitalize.
President Joe Biden is attending a meeting of NATO allies on Monday ahead of his much-anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. This is Biden’s first foreign trip as president, stopping first in the U.K. over the weekend to meet G-7 leaders and Queen Elizabeth II.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Producer prices
Prices paid by companies to producers are expected to rise by 0.6% in May from the levels in April, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. That would match the increase from the prior month.
Year-over-year, the PPI is expected to have spiked by 6.3%, the largest increase since the agency started tracking the data in 2010. It had jumped 6.2% on a yearly basis in April.
2. Retail sales
Core retail sales in May, a number that excludes automobiles, are seen rising 0.2% from the prior month. They had contracted by 0.8% in April. Overall, retail sales are expected to dip 0.7% for the month after being flat previously. 
3. Oracle earnings
It’s a mostly quiet week for earnings, and most investors are focused on the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, but there are a handful of tech reports. One comes Tuesday from Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which is seen posting earnings per share of $1.31 on revenue of $11.02 billion for the fourth quarter ended May 31.

This recovery is likely to continue in the near term, making energy stocks EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) attractive investment bets, we believe. Read on.Investors have been betting on energy stocks since early this year, given the rapid rise in economic and industrial activities with the progress made in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. This is evidenced by the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index’s 68.3% gains year-to-date, versus the broader S&P 500 index’s 12.9% returns over this period.
Oil prices are currently hovering near their two-year highs, at more than $70 per barrel, driven by rising demand from major economies as industrial and manufacturing activities re-engage. As the major oil consuming emerging markets of India and Brazil recover from recent new waves of coronavirus, the demand for oil is expected to rise further in the near term. OPEC+ expects oil demand to rise 6.6% year-over-year in 2021.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped from near all-time highs Monday on worries that the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting could usher in a talk of bond tapering in the wake of a sharp upturn in inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.22%, though remained close to its record high 4,249.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.63%, or 217 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.33%.
Investors could be in for a surprise on Wednesday when the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, concludes its two-day meeting as investor bets that inflation is transitory may prove somewhat unfounded.
""Given the shift in the mix of inflation from transitory towards sustainable, the risk of a hawkish tilt within the FOMC has increased,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The fall in rates leading up to the FOMC meeting suggests investors are dismissing inflation as transitory, just ""at the time when the sustainability of inflation looks more viable,"" Morgan Stanley added.  
Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones said Monday that if the Fed doesn't acknowledge the recent jump in the pace of inflation, then that would be the ""green light to go heavy on the inflation trade."" Tudor touted gold, bitcoin and cash as his go-to inflation hedges.
Against the backdrop of these concerns somewhat that the Fed may tilt hawkish, Treasury yields climbed, but that didn't spell doom and gloom for highly-valued technology stocks, which tend to be less attractive in rising rate environments.  
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) traded higher.
Cyclicals including industrials, energy, and financials were not having a good day.
Financials slipped more than 1%, paced by a drop in banking stocks after JPMorgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon warned the that pandemic-led boom in trading revenue for JPMorgan could be nearing an end.
Fixed-income trading revenue JPMorgan will be just above $6 billion in the second quarter, Dimon said Monday at a Morgan Stanley virtual conference.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) were down more than 1%.
Energy, meanwhile, failed to capitalize on a jump in oil prices toward 32-month highs amid losses in  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Hess (NYSE:HES).
In other news, Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) fell 18% after Steve Burns and Julio Rodriguez resigned as the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively."

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Monday will seek to bar publication of documents her legal team received from HSBC, a request opposed by Canadian prosecutors in her U.S. extradition case who say it violates the principles of open court.
Meng's legal team will present arguments in support of the ban in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States, where she faces charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran and potentially causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions on business in Iran.
She has been under house arrest in Vancouver for more than two years and fighting her extradition to the United States. Meng has said she is innocent.
Lawyers for Huawei and HSBC in Hong Kong agreed to a release of the documents in April to Meng's legal team on the condition that they ""use reasonable effort"" to keep confidential information concealed from the public, according to submissions filed by the defense on Friday.
Prosecutors representing the Canadian government argued against the ban, saying in submissions filed the same day that ""to be consistent with the open court principle, a ban must be tailored"" and details should be selectively redacted from the public, rather than the whole documents.
A consortium of media outlets, including Reuters News, also opposes the ban.
The open court principle requires that court proceedings be open and accessible to the public and to the media.
It is unclear what documents Huawei obtained from HSBC, but defense lawyers argue they are relevant to Meng's case.

Meng's hearing was initially set to wrap up in May but Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes granted an extension to allow the defense to read through the new documents.
Hearings in the extradition case are scheduled to finish in late August.

And because analysts expect the Fed to maintain its dovish monetary policy stance for now, the stock markets are expected to remain bullish in the near term. Hence, we think the momentum gained by ABB Ltd (ABB),  Best Buy  (BBY), and SS&C Technologies (SSNC) amid the fast-paced economic recovery could continue. Let’s discuss these names.The disconnect between the stock markets and the real economy witnessed last year has been reversing this year. A fast-paced economic revival has been driving the stock markets, with major benchmark indices hitting their all-time highs. The S&P 500 index hit its 4,249.74 all-time high on June 10, driven by the U.S. House of Representatives’ $547 billion infrastructure stimulus package approval that day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index crossed 30,000 for the first time in April and hit its 35,091.56 all-time high on May 10. Also, with benchmark Treasury yields currently declining, the tech-savvy Nasdaq Composite is rebounding gradually. The index has gained 7.3% over the past month, and 1.5% over the past five days.
While the markets are still volatile due to rising inflation concerns--consumer prices gained 5% year-over-year in May, their highest gain in nearly 13 years--the Fed believes the prevailing inflation rates to be temporary. Because price levels are expected to stabilize over the long run, the stock market is expected to remain bullish in the near term.
Thus, the prices of top momentum stocks ABB Ltd (ABB), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC) are expected to continue ascending in the coming months.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 02:27PM ET</span>",Shell weighs blockbuster sale of Texas shale assets,"By Ron Bousso, Jessica Resnick-Ault and David French
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is reviewing its holdings in the largest U.S. oil field for a potential sale, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a key moment in its shift away from fossil fuels as it faces growing pressure to slash carbon emissions.
The sale could be for part or all of Shell's position in the U.S. Permian Basin, located mostly in Texas, which accounted for around 6% of the Anglo-Dutch company's total oil and gas output last year. The holdings could be worth more than $10 billion, the people said. 
Shell declined to comment. 
There was no guarantee Shell would end up striking a deal for the assets, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information.
Shell, the second largest western energy company, and its peers have come under investor pressure to increase profits and slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including by shedding assets. 
Any retreat from the Permian would mark a major shift from an area previously identified as one of nine core basins in its energy transition strategy to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. For all the activity in the Permian, profits have remained elusive because of scale and constant drilling required to boost output. 
Shell's energy transition plan, one of the sector's most ambitious, aims to reduce oil and gas output gradually and boost spending on renewables, hydrogen and low-carbon technologies. 
A Dutch court last month ordered Shell to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, much faster than planned. Shell plans to appeal the ruling, CEO Ben van Beurden said last week, but the company will also deepen emission cuts, a move likely to shrink its oil and gas business.
The energy major plans to reduce oil output by 1% to 2% per year by 2030 through lower investment and disposals. It will increase spending on renewables and low carbon technologies to up to 25% of its overall budget by 2025.
PERMIAN HEATING UP
The Permian's rapid growth upended global oil markets last decade with vast production and the ability to ramp output up and down. Its potential for future gains has fueled strong dealmaking even amid uncertainty over the long-term outlook for oil demand. 
Benchmark oil prices have soared this year with fuel demand rising as the coronavirus pandemic ebbs. U.S. crude futures are up 49% this year to nearly $72 per barrel, more than double their 2020 lows. 
More shale deals are likely this year, with industry experts pointing to big Permian land holders including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) aiming to shed some assets to raise cash. 
Permian consolidation has accelerated, with  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) acquiring two companies, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) acquiring another. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) agreed to sell some of its Permian holdings to Colgate Energy for $508 million in a move to reduce its debt. 
A U.S. DOWNSIZING
Shell's oil and gas production from company-operated and non-operated rigs in the Permian averaged 193,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in 2020, according to its website, down from about 250,000 the prior year. 
Permian production overall is roughly 4.5 million barrels per day, or about 40% of total U.S. output. 
A Permian sale would further shrink Shell's U.S. footprint. The company has agreed to sell all but one of its U.S. oil refineries. It continues major offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico and could green-light a new development, called Whale, in the coming months. 

A full sale would mark one of Shell's largest disposals in recent years and pare net debt to below its $65 billion target, a key part of its energy transition strategy. Net debt reached $71 billion at the end of March. 
The Hague-based Shell bought its initial Permian acreage from Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) in 2012 for $1.9 billion and inherited a joint venture that Chesapeake had with Anadarko. They dissolved the venture five years later, leaving Shell with the 260,000 net acres it now holds.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",UK's financial watchdog goes real-time to catch online criminals,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator has to make daily sweeps of the internet to warn about online scams in real time and keep pace with fraudsters who are often based outside the country, one of its officials said on Monday.
Mark Steward, the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) director for enforcement, said the warnings have become a cornerstone of the watchdog's fight against a surge in financial scams after pandemic lockdowns sent more people online.
The FCA issued 1,200 consumer warnings last year about scams advertised via social media platforms by fake companies that are not regulated by the watchdog, double the amount in 2019, Steward told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
""We are now issuing warnings straight away, we are conducting sweeps several times a day of the internet and issuing warnings within 24 hours so they are up to date,"" he said.
Faster warnings limit the number of victims and banks should be checking who is on the list in case they are customers, Steward said, meaning lenders could be unwittingly aiding fraud by taking payments on behalf of criminals.
Online financial scams are not as widespread as more traditional banking fraud, which is often done by tricking customers into giving away passwords or making transfers, but they are growing quickly.
Last year, victims of investment scams who referred to a social media platform lost 63 million pounds ($89 million), according to the UK's Action Fraud, almost a 10th of the 784 million lost to financial fraud.
The FCA is also paying Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to publish the regulator's warnings and Steward said the U.S. social media giant had offered it a ""credit"" on future warnings.
Britain has proposed an ""online harms"" law but it does not require social media companies to check on the validity of firms advertising financial products. 
The FCA wants such checks to be made obligatory under the new law.
""The irony of us having to pay social media to publish warnings about advertising they are receiving money from is not lost on us,"" Steward said.
Lawmaker Anthony Browne urged Steward not to be overawed by the deep pockets of social media firms and to consider if Google was itself guilty of fraud by advertising scams.
Google has said it has robust financial products and services policies, and has been adding more requirements on advertisers.
Steward said the ball was now in the court of social media firms to come up with ways to tackle scams.

""We shall see how successful they really are. The proof will be in the pudding. If the proof is not in the pudding, then we are going to have to take action of a different kind,"" he said.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",Loeb's U.S. hedge fund Third Point owns Vivendi stake - source,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) owns a substantial stake in Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SE and is ""evaluating"" the French media giant's plan to sell a stake in its Universal Music Group to rival billionaire investor William Ackman, a source familiar with the firm's holdings said on Monday.
New York-based Third Point has been invested in Paris-based Vivendi for some time, the person said, requesting anonymity because the matter is private.
A Vivendi spokesman on Monday said, ""The company has yet to see any evidence of a stake being built,"" in response to a question about the Third Point holding. A Third Point representative declined to comment.
Third Point's stake was first reported by Bloomberg.
Vivendi has become popular with certain investors ever since it announced plans to spin off 60% of Universal. Earlier this month Ackman said his blank-check company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings is planning to buy 10% of Universal before the planned spinoff.
Vivendi, controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, last month set out a plan to list Universal, the world's largest music group, by Sept. 27. 
Investors will have a chance to vote on the proposed spinoff later this month and some have already expressed reservations.
Activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners and investment fund Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) have raised concerns about the spinoff, decrying the transaction as unfavorable to some investors.
Glass Lewis and ISS, the world's two biggest proxy advisers,
have recommended Vivendi shareholders vote in favor of the
spinoff plans. 
Third Point is trying to evaluate what Ackman's proposal would mean for Vivendi shareholders and has not commented publicly about the matter.
Loeb and Ackman, both prominent New York hedge fund managers, have crossed on other investments, including  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF) and United Technologies (NYSE:RTX), for example, and sometimes taken differing approaches.

Loeb has had his own blank check company and invested in a number of others, according to letters to his investors and regulatory filings. He did not invest with Pershing Square's Tontine Holdings, which counts other prominent hedge funds as investors.

Boston-based iTeos, whose shares jumped 52% in premarket trading, will receive a $625 million upfront payment and is eligible to get up to $1.45 billion more if the programme meets certain development and commercial milestones.
GlaxoSmithKline is under pressure to shore up its drug pipeline after a report that U.S. activist investor Elliott built up a significant stake in the company. The British drugmaker is also preparing to outline plans to split its consumer products business from its drug operations. 
The iTeos deal is to develop EOS-448, a monoclonal antibody that acts as an anti-TIGIT agent, which showed promise in early studies. 
Anti-TIGIT treatments are new experimental immunotherapies against certain cancer types. These treatments, including Roche's tiragolumab and Merck & Co vibostolimab, are designed to deactivate a tumour's ability to evade the immune system.
GSK's chief scientific officer Hal Barron, said immuno-oncology had ""transformed cancer care"" but that less than 30% of patients respond to treatment with the current leading immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
The deal with iTeos will make GSK the only company with antibodies targeting the three known checkpoints, which sometimes keep the immune system from fighting cancer cells, GSK said.

EOS-448 is currently being tested in an early-stage study in patients with advanced solid tumours. GSK and iTeos plan to start combination studies of EOS-448 with GSK's recently approved cancer drug dostarlimab in 2022. 
ITeos is eligible to get milestones and royalty payments on sales outside the United States, and the two companies will share both costs of the development and profits in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday tapped a new chief to lead a unit tasked with overseeing public company disclosures as the agency moves to address rising calls for greater transparency from companies about environmental, social and governance issues. 
Renee Jones, recently an associate dean at Boston College Law School, will become director of the SEC's division of corporation finance on June 21, the SEC said in a statement. Before her career in academia, Jones was an attorney with Hill & Barlow law firm.
The appointment puts Jones in a critical role overseeing a unit already heavily involved with the SEC's efforts to update regulations around climate risk disclosures and tasked with approving filings for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, at a time of increasing scrutiny of the shell companies.
The SEC's division of corporation finance has been reviewing public company disclosures around climate risks, an issue that has gained increasing attention from regulators. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took the helm at the agency in April, has said rulemaking around climate risk will be a key focus. 
The unit has also been ramping up focus on SPACs, which have become a popular method for companies to go public. Jones has called for regulatory changes to SPACs to better protect investors.

Analysts also expect her to help oversee the agency's efforts to reverse a 20-year decline in U.S. public company listings by making it harder for companies to tap private sources of capital.
The unit's current acting head, John Coates, will become SEC general counsel, also effective June 21, the statement said. Coates, previously a professor at Harvard University, has been leading the division of corporation finance since February.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Shares in companies controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani shed more than $6 billion on Monday despite rejecting media reports that said accounts of three foreign investor funds that own stocks had been frozen.
Adani Group flagship Adani Enterprises closed down 6.3% after plunging as much as 25%, its steepest fall in nearly a decade.
The freezing of the three accounts was first flagged in an article in India's Economic Times on Monday. 
The Adani Group firms involved rejected reports about the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) freezing the funds' accounts as ""blatantly erroneous"" in identical statements issued to stock exchanges.
The NSDL website showed it had frozen as of May 31 the accounts of Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund without citing a reason. 
The Adani firms said they had received an e-mail from the ""Registrar and Transfer Agent"" dated June 14 saying ""that the Demat Account in which the aforesaid funds hold the shares of the company were not frozen"".
The NSDL and India's securities regulator SEBI did not respond to requests for immediate comment. 
But a senior NSDL official said the depository had frozen accounts of the funds that hold certain other securities and not those holding Adani company shares, adding that freeze was ""not new"". 
""Foreign portfolio investors generally have one account. But in certain circumstances they can have multiple accounts. In this case, the funds hold at least more than one account,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to speak publicly on the issue. 
Reuters was unable to reach the funds for comment. 
Shares of Adani Ports ended down 8.5% after falling as much as 19%.
While Adani Green Energy clawed back most losses to end slightly lower, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Power shed 5%. 
Graphic: Adani group's shares share tank on Monday - https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-ADANI/rlgvddgrnvo/Adani.png 
The funds are among the top foreign investors in Adani group companies, based on data from stock exchanges and company reports.
An email sent by an Adani executive to NSDL, reviewed by Reuters, showed Albula and Cresta had cut their stakes in Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises as of June 11, compared with holdings on March 31, based on National Stock Exchange data. 
Albula had cut its cumulative stake by nearly a fourth, while Cresta had cut by nearly a third its total stake in the three companies.
APMS had slightly increased its stake in Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission and maintained stake in Adani Enterprises, the email showed.

Adani Enterprises stock has risen more than 10-fold in the past year to Friday, in a broad surge in shares in Adani Group companies that has made Adani the second richest Asian, behind Mukesh Ambani of oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries.

However, after hitting an extraordinary high, it is losing value on investor concerns over the creation of an asset bubble. Factors such as slow adoption, limited real-world use and the absence of any tangible factors behind its skyrocketing rally, among others, make it a highly risky asset.
Conversely, software solutions have been playing an important role in the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. Even though investors’ rotation away from expensive tech stocks amid the economic recovery this year has led to a correction in software stocks also, the industry nonetheless holds immense growth potential.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's market regulator fined Franklin Templeton India's trustee, chief executive and officials, including fund mangers, on Monday for violating rules while overseeing credit funds that unexpectedly shut down last year.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said chief executive Sanjay Sapre failed to address the risk of illiquid underlying portfolios while fund managers did not ensure funds were invested in the best interest of unitholders. 
It fined the fund manager's trustee and eight Franklin India officials, including Sapre, a total of 150 million rupees ($2 million) - only a week after fining the investment giant 50 million rupees for lapses and violations related to the funds.
The trustee - Franklin Templeton Trustee Services - said in a statement to Reuters that it disagreed with SEBI's findings and intended to appeal. In a separate statement, Franklin Templeton said its employees acted ""in compliance with regulations and in the best interest of unitholders"".
Franklin has faced regulatory investigations and court battles since April 2020 when it unexpectedly wound up six credit funds in India with assets of close to $4 billion, citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
The funds had large exposures to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities.
Last week, the regulator also banned Franklin Templeton, one of India's most prominent fixed-income fund houses, from launching any new debt schemes for two years after an investigation into the fund closures.

Commenting on the trustee, SEBI said in its 151-page order that it ""failed to render at all times high standards of service, exercise due diligence, ensure proper care and exercise independent professional judgment"".
In an email to investors on Wednesday, Franklin said it continues to manage more than 610 billion rupees ($8 billion) for more than two million investors in India and it was committed to serving Indian investors.

AMC’s shares were recently up 18.3% at around $58.50 after edging 3% higher last week. The company said in a filing last week that over 80% of its shares were held by retail investors.
Rallies in AMC and video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), as well as a fresh crop of so-called meme stocks - companies popular with retail investors congregating on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets - have breathed fresh life into a frenzy that first garnered widespread attention in January, when an unwind of bearish bets helped send GameStop’s shares up more than 1,600% that month. 
Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corp told CNBC on Monday that the “craziest mix of fiscal and monetary policy” has helped fuel the blistering rallies in some meme stocks as well as other assets, such as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. 
""Things are absolutely bat-s crazy and at some point you have to say, 'slow down, let's get back in the lanes and we'll drive like we used to,"" Tudor Jones said on CNBC.

However, given heated competition from foreign and local players, and the ill effects of a global semiconductor chip shortage, will the stock be able to perform well in the near term? Read on.Headquartered in Jinhua, China, Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (KNDI) develops, produces and markets electric vehicle (EV) products and parts and electric scooters and EV battery packs internationally. KNDI’s stock has gained 114.9% over the past year. This gain is attributable primarily to the optimism surrounding the company’s new product development initiatives and EV industry tailwinds in China.
However, its shares have declined 7.8% year-to-date. The company reported a loss in its first quarter financial results. Meanwhile, because the global semiconductor chip shortage is expected to persist, it could hamper KNDI’s production lineup. In addition, because competition in the sector is intensifying, KNDI’s poor profit margin could cause the stock to continue declining .

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – ResMed (NYSE:RMD) shares rose more than 4% Monday following its rival Philips (NYSE:PHG) recalling certain breathing devices and ventilators on concerns they could harm the patients.
Needham & Company analyst Michael  Matson  (NYSE:MATX) said Philips’ troubles could benefit ResMed. Needham has a buy rating on the stock with a $229 target. The stock touched a high of $229.17 in the session so far today.
Philips shares fell over 4% today following its decision to voluntarily recall Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure and mechanical ventilator devices.
A certain kind of foam, polyester-based polyurethane, is used to muffle the noise generated during use of these devices.
Philips said the PE-PUR foam may degrade into particles which may enter the device’s air pathway and be ingested or inhaled by the user, and the foam may off-gas certain chemicals.
The foam degradation may be exacerbated by use of unapproved cleaning methods. High heat and high humidity environments may also contribute to foam degradation, the company said in a note.
Philips will replace the current sound abatement foam with a new material and has already begun the preparations, which include obtaining the relevant regulatory clearances.
The company has advised patients to consult their physician before taking any action and weigh between the risks of continuing the therapy and those identified in the recall notification.

(Reuters) -European shares ended at a record high on Monday as energy stocks surged on strength in the oil market, while expectations of accommodative monetary policy grew even as a global economic recovery picked up speed. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2% to a record-high close of 458.32 points. The index had touched an all-time high of 460.51 earlier in the session.
Energy stocks were the best performers, surging 2% as oil prices surged to an over two-year peak on expectations of strong global demand this year. [O/R]
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) was the top boost to the sector, rising 2.7% after Reuters reported the firm was reviewing its holdings in the largest U.S. oil field for a potential sale.
""Oil’s resilience in the face of warming U.S.-Iran relations suggests that the supply dynamic continues to play second fiddle to the expectation that demand will keep building into the second half of the year,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. 
Germany's DAX came off a record high, while the UK's FTSE 100 scaled its highest level since February 2020, but trimmed some gains as investors awaited an update on Britain's COVID-19 lockdown measures. 
After the European Central Bank last week kept monetary policy unchanged at accommodative levels, all eyes this week will be on the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting, with the bank expected to maintain its dovish stance. 
Any cues that policymakers might be digging in for a more sustained rise in inflation could spark fears of a sooner-than-expected unwinding of easy money policies and hurt stocks, analysts said.
""If central banks start to lay out a path that involves a withdrawal of stimulus, markets could get spooked. No one is seriously suggesting a rise in rates yet, but there is scope to reduce the monthly bond purchase amount without jeopardising the recovery,"" said Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Italy's stock index rose 0.2%, while its 10-year sovereign bond yield sank to eight-week lows on continued dovish signals from the ECB. 

German software developer Teamviewer AG jumped 5.9% to near the top of the STOXX 600, after it announced a partnership with software giant SAP.
On the other hand, Dutch medical equipment company Philips tumbled 4.2% and was among the worst performers on the STOXX 600 after it said it would recall some CPAP breathing devices and ventilators globally because of a foam part that might degrade and become toxic.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",Novavax COVID-19 vaccine more than 90% effective in U.S. trial,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -Novavax Inc on Monday said its COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage U.S.-based clinical trial. 
The study of nearly 30,000 volunteers in the United States and Mexico puts  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) on track to file for emergency authorization in the United States and elsewhere in the third quarter of 2021, the company said. 
The protein-based vaccine was more than 93% effective against the more easily transmissible predominant coronavirus variants that have caused concern among scientists and public health officials, Novavax said. 
Protein-based vaccines are a conventional approach that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response, such as those used against whooping cough and shingles. 
While the trial was being conducted, the virus variant first discovered in the United Kingdom and now known as the Alpha variant was the most common circulating in the United States, the company said. 
The concerning variants first identified in Brazil, South Africa and India were also detected among the trial's participants, Novavax's head of research and development, Dr. Gregory Glenn, told Reuters. 
The vaccine was 91% effective among volunteers at high risk of severe infection and 100% effective in preventing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. It was roughly 70% effective against virus variants that Novavax was unable to identify, Glenn said. 
""Practically speaking, it's very important that the vaccine can protect against a virus that is wildly swinging around"" in terms of new variants, Glenn said. 
Novavax said the vaccine was generally well tolerated. Side effects included headache, fatigue and muscle pain and were generally mild. A small number of participants experienced side effects described as severe.
Novavax remains on track to produce 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter of 2021 and 150 million doses per month in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said. 
Chief Executive Stanley Erck told CNBC on Monday it is possible the United States could donate the 110 million shots Novavax has agreed to supply to the U.S. government to the COVAX program that provides COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries. 
The Maryland-based company has repeatedly pushed back production forecasts and has struggled to access raw materials and equipment needed to manufacture its vaccine. 
However, in a May investor call, Erck said major manufacturing hurdles have been cleared and that all of its facilities can now produce COVID-19 vaccine at commercial scale.
Erck said Novavax has begun its regulatory filing in India in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is contracted to make Novavax shots. 
Erck said his understanding is that SII is no longer constrained by raw materials shortages. 

SII had said in March that U.S. restrictions on exports of supplies used for vaccines were limiting its ability to scale up production.
Novavax shares were off 3% in midday trading.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were up a little over 1% Monday as traders reacted positively to CEO Elon Musk’s tweet that the company would resume allowing Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) transactions once “there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.""
The shares shrugged off Canaccord (TSX:CF) lowering its target for the stock to $812 from $974. The share currently trades 24% below Canaccord’s target price.
Traders, crypto miners, speculators and supporters of digital currencies treat Musk as their unofficial spokesperson, looking out for his views on the cryptos and catching every word or meme he posts to decide their trades.
So when Musk on May 13 said Tesla would no longer be accepting bitcoin from buyers of Tesla vehicles because of their high energy consumption, many questioned the crypto’s raison d'être. Not much later, Musk was championing Dogecoin DOGE/USD.
In the days that followed, bitcoin fell to $30,000-levels, losing more than a third of its value in a single day on May 19 before recovering. Many other cryptocurrencies fell even more sharply.
Musk also said that Tesla sold about 10% of holdings to confirm bitcoin could be liquidated easily without moving market.
Both Tesla and Musk, in his personal capacity, had invested in bitcoin. The EV maker had pumped in $1.5 billion in February. It’s not certain how much bitcoin Tesla and Musk still hold.

Investing.com -- The Wendy’s Co (NASDAQ:WEN) jumped more than 1% after Piper Sandler reiterated a buy-equivalent rating. 
Wendy’s same-store sales remain in the “+mid-teens% range (higher sequentially) driven in part by menu innovation efforts and the new app/loyalty program,” analyst Nicole Regan wrote in a note, StreetInsider reported.
The analyst reiterated an overweight rating and $27 price target following positive checks for May. “Our domestic checks for May validate the notion that sales are not the restaurant industry’s issue (especially compared to labor),” Regan said. “Consumers have all but flipped a switch, noting sales channels are shifting from drive-thru back to dine-in. Most (if not all) concepts are up across the board.”

Read more to find out.While 2020 was quite a year for electric vehicle stocks, 2021 is shaping up to be a year whose headlines are dominated by meme stocks. Meme stocks became popular earlier this year as retail investors sent the price of struggling video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) to ridiculous heights. GME went from $19.95 on January 12th to $325 on January 29th.
This 1,529% gain over two weeks was attributed to traders in Reddit's r/wallstreetbets subreddit pumping up the stock to create a short squeeze. This was repeated for a few more stocks before things quieted down for a little while. But meme stocks have recently made a comeback, with shares of companies like Blackberry (TSX:BB) AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) soaring. These stocks are not rising due to company performance; instead their gains result from social media attention, hence the name meme.

So, we think that Investors who are seeking to capitalize on the industry’s impressive future growth—ignoring the short-term price fluctuations—could bet on large-cap stocks Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and QUALCOMM (QCOM). Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to deliver solid returns in the near term. Read on.After exponential gains last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic-driven increased dependence on tech solutions since the beginning of the year, the technology industry has been witnessing high volatility due to investors’ rotation out of the sector and into cyclical stocks to capitalize on the recovering economy and due to fears of rising inflation.
Nevertheless, the tech industry is well positioned to gain due to rapid adoption of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR) and 5g network. The expected continuation of remote working (a key part of organizations’ hybrid working models) should also lead to an increase in demand for advanced software, cybersecurity solutions and cloud computing. Indeed, the tech industry is expected to hit a$5 trillion market value by year’s end.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite’s 7% returns over the past month reflect investors’ renewed interest in the tech space. Given the industry’s promising prospects, analysts are highly optimistic about the near-term performance of large-cap tech stocks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

Given these companies’ market dominance, we think their stocks are well positioned to withstand any short-term market volatility and deliver solid returns.

ROME (Reuters) - The European Commission on Monday gave Italy a green light for a one-year extension, until the middle of 2022, of a state guarantee scheme that has been key in ridding the country's banks of bad debts.
By narrowing the losses that banks must bear to shed bad loans, the 'GACS' guarantee scheme Rome introduced in 2016 has helped to turn Italy into Europe's biggest market for soured bank loans.
Italian lenders have cut those problem assets by more than 200 billion euros ($242 billion) over the past five years. GACS-backed disposals totalled 87 billion euros, consultancy KMPG has calculated.
Banks are bracing for a new wave of insolvencies driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Rome recently also reintroduced for 2021 the tax benefits for impaired loan disposals that expired in December.
After extending the GACS scheme once in May 2019 for two years, Italy needed approval from European Union competition authorities to prolong it for another year.
Similarly, Greece in April extended to October 2022 its 'Hercules' scheme that is modelled on the GACS.
Under the GACS programme, Italian banks can buy a guarantee from the Treasury to back the least risky notes when repackaging bad loans as securities.
In extending the measure, Italy rebuffed market demands to widen the scheme to include ""unlikely-to-pay"" (UTP) loans which, unlike bad loans, are not yet in default and could be recovered by returning borrowers to health.
The Treasury worried that UTP loans could be dealt with as defaulted loans by rating agencies and investors, tilting borrowers over the edge, sources have said.
""The market welcomes the renewal of the GACS scheme but it hopes Italy will find a way to widen state guarantee measures to include also UTP loans,"" said Dario Spoto, a partner with KPMG Corporate Finance in Italy.
""We expect GACS-backed bad loan sales worth around 20 billion euros before the end of the year, involving both larger banks and smaller players that can get together in multi-originator deals,"" he added.
At the end of last year, GACS-backed debt held by investors amounted to 10.4 billion euros, according to Italy's Treasury.

Investing.com – Shares of Covid-19 vaccine makers like BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) weakened on Monday on prospects of one more rival,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), joining them in the market.
BioNTech slumped 9% and Moderna by 8%.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which makes and markets the vaccine in collaboration with BioNTech, fell 1.5%.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the only one with a single-dose vaccine, was down 0.5%. Novavax itself had a volatile session, giving up its gains of over 9% premarket to go into the red in the session underway.
The company today, in a premarket release, said a phase-three trial had found its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine to be 90.4% effective.
The trial had 29,960 participants across the U.S. and Mexico.
The vaccine was found to be 100% effective in preventing moderate and severe infections and 93% effective against some variants, Novavax said. The company plans to file for approval with the Food and Drug Administration in the third quarter.
Upon regulatory approvals, Novavax remains on track to reach manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said in the release."
1579,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 10:48AM ET</span>",BarkBox Eyes Growth With Tailor-Made Items For Our Furry Friends,"By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com -- Dogs are unique. Their diets and toys should be, as well. 
That idea led to BarkBox, which makes customized packages of toys, snacks and more designed for your dog alone and sends them to you on a monthly subscription basis. The Original Bark Co (NYSE:BARK), as its parent company is known, went public via a SPAC reverse-merger earlier this month. The company is betting that we love our pups so much we're willing to eschew generic toys, treats and food in favor of carefully curated goods. 
Bark has been a major beneficiary as pet adoptions have soared thanks to our year-plus of being forced to stay at home to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The company saw sales jump 79% in its most recent quarter, and new subscriptions increased 51% from a year earlier. Net revenue is forecast to nearly double from fiscal 2021 to 2023. It expects to see a rate of growth around 40% for the next couple of years. 
""There aren't any options in terms of brands that are creating products for your dog as an individual -- individual dogs have different needs,"" said Matt Meeker, founder of Bark, in a telephone interview earlier this month. ""We found a huge market with customers that are being served by companies that are 100 years old.""Bark's not alone in tapping into the deep love we feel for our pooches. Online pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) saw shares rally more than 200% since going public in June 2019, reaching a record in February, as sales soared amid that frenzy of pet adoptions combined with the encouragement to hunker down at home. 
It's all thanks to Hugo
""It all started with my great dane, Hugo,"" Meeker said. The 130-pound canine was living with his human in Brooklyn but wasn't very well served by New York City pet stores that typically didn't carry things for a dog of his size. Bingo, a business opportunity was born. 
""It turns out there are tens of millions of people who have dogs that they are obsessed with and want to make happy,"" Meeker said. 
Bark was founded in 2012. The pandemic helped accelerate results, adding many more new customers who brought home the love of a good dog to cope with the stress of a global health crisis. 
""It came at a good time for us where some of our newer products were ready for the market,"" Meeker said. Coincidentally, Bark had started building up redundancy through its supply chain around the start of the pandemic, which helped them keep pace with demand -- though they also had to cap growth for a bit, Meeker said.  
""The challenge in growing quickly with that level of personalization, it's a massive challenge that we've taken on fairly well so far but it's getting bigger and bigger by the day,"" Meeker said. Enter Chief Executive Officer Manish Joneja, who joined the company in September after four years in global producing, technology and operations at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and five years at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in global expansion.Providing a good logistics experience is key in ecommerce. Between inflation and high demand for products of all kinds, Bark is seeing the cost of its products increase, but largely the higher expenses have been related to freight. Thus far, those costs have been absorbed without a price increase to customers, while maintaining margins intact, Joneja said.   
Ok, so how is Bark different than Chewy? 
Chewy also offers subscription boxes, and you can always get pet products from Amazon or pop over to your local PetSmart. 
But Joneja stresses that Bark designs and develops unique, proprietary products and then delivers a personalized experience to dogs and their humans. He cites the technology and data collection that enable personalization at a scale that makes the company different from the rest. ""We build deep customer relationships,"" Joneja said in an email. ""We leverage these relationships and the power of analytics to achieve personalization and cross selling at scale on our strong platform.""Think about it this way. Has your dog Buster gained a little weight? A nutritionist will work with you to initially help with weight loss, then adjust the food you buy from Bark to maintain that healthier weight. Does your dog Bella have chicken allergies? No problem. The treats Bark sends will be poultry-free.   Granted, the lifting of restrictions in the U.S. is changing behavior. People are leaving their houses more often, and maybe spending less time ordering subscription boxes for Fido and more time on subscription boxes of swimwear and books to take to that beach vacation we all so desperately need. Note that Chewy shares are down more than 30% since hitting that February record, coinciding with the spread of vaccines and retreat of Covid-19 in the U.S.
Still, there are an estimated 63 million dog homes in the U.S., and Bark currently serves just 1.8 million of those households. While growth that has accelerated is expected to continue to do so, Bark vows not to bite off more than it can chew, the executives said. 
Meeker notes that in nearly 10 years, the company raised only $57 million before going public this month. 
And while special purpose acquisition vehicles have garnered a bad reputation of late among investors, ""We run a very tight, fast-growing business with real revenue,"" Meeker said. ""We have a real business here, we're forecasting over $500 million in revenue.""

However, the current consensus is that inflation may be peaking. If this is the case, then the Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ), US Global Jets ETF (JETS), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) are 4 ETFs worth buying. .The May CPI print of 5.0% was the highest since August 2008. However, this figure isn’t expected to alter the Fed’s timeline for tightening monetary policy. According to futures markets, the Fed isn’t expected to hike interest rates until the middle of 2023 which implies that tapering of asset purchases won’t begin until the middle of 2022.
Of course, this outlook only makes sense if inflation is transitory. Many are skeptical and believe that we are in a new inflation regime due to the combination of the Fed’s low rates and aggressive fiscal policy. So far, the market seems to believe that inflation is transitory as several market-based measures of inflation have dropped over the past few weeks despite headline inflation numbers coming in strong. This is evident from the Fed Funds futures markets, TIPS, and the decline in Treasury yields.
If the market consensus is correct, and inflation readings are about to turn lower, then investors should adjust their strategies accordingly. 4 ETFs that could outperform in an environment of decelerating inflation are the Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ), US Global Jets ETF (JETS), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY).

However, the stock’s price has tumbled 47.3% over the past four months. So, now that the solar industry has hit a rough patch because of rising module prices, the question is will that weigh on SPWR’s stock price in the near term? Let’s discuss. Read on.Solar solutions provider SunPower Corporation (SPWR) specializes in solar power generation and energy storage, and operates through four segments: residential, light commercial; commercial and industrial solutions; and others. The company’s continuing residential business momentum and robust pipeline growth has helped the stock gain 270% over the past year. However, SPWR’s stock has declined 27.9% over the past three months and 47.3% over the past four months. Closing yesterday’s trading session at $25.90, SPWR’s stock is trading 55% below its $57.52 all-time high.
Although the renewable power generation sector has expanded at a fast pace over the past couple of years, the rising price of solar modules could lead to a slowing in uptake of solar power, in both the residential and commercial segments.
SPWR is still struggling to turn its revenues into profit. Furthermore, its increasing losses and net debt could prolong investors’ bearish sentiment.

Investing.com -- Oat milk anyone? Hm, maybe.
Most analysts appear to be into the alt-milk drink, while others not so much.
Shares fell some 3%.
Piper Sandler is firmly in the buy camp, saying its brand equity and pricing power set it apart and warrant a valuation premium. 
The total addressable market size is ""significant"" and Oatly should continue gaining share, only limited by capacity. It also has solid (buzz term!) ESG credentials, boasting 80% less carbon emissions and 60% less energy usage versus cow's milk, analyst Michael Lavery wrote in a note according to StreetInsider. He set a price target of $30.00.
Guggenheim also called Oatly a buy, with a $32 price target, similarly calling it ""uniquely positioned with a defensible market position"" thanks to its sustainability focus and a disruptive marketing with a unique “in-your-face” brand message to challenge the status quo, analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note, StreetInsider reported.
""In our view, the company is in the early stages of a long-term growth story that could generate double-digit annual sales growth for at least the next 10 years if it continues to invest heavily in capacity expansion,"" Grandet said. 
RBC Capital, meanwhile, initiated coverage at a neutral-equivalent, with a price target of $28. Analyst Nik Modi said, ""Our rating is less about our belief in the Oatly growth story and more about taking a measured approach to stock-picking based on the company’s current growth-related challenges (capacity buildout that could delay profitability timeline).""
 Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Oppenheimer also gave the stock a neutral-equivalent, with the latter citing valuation as a reason to remain on the sidelines, for now.
Sweden-based Oatly went public in May, raising $1.4 billion.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: El Salvador bitcoin transfers soar, but still a fraction of dollar remittances","(Fixes typo)
By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - Small transfers of bitcoin to El Salvador jumped over four-fold in May from a year ago but still represent a small amount when compared to remittances sent in dollars, data shared with Reuters showed.
The Central American country last week became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, with President Nayib Bukele touting the cryptocurrency's potential as a remittance currency for Salvadorans overseas.
Monthly bitcoin transfers of under $1,000 - a proxy for money sent to the country from Salvadorans working abroad - totalled $1.7 million in May compared to $424,000 year earlier, U.S. crypto researcher Chainalysis found. 
Such transfers hit a peak of $2.5 million in March, though a comparison with the previous year was unavailable.
El Salvador is heavily reliant on remittances. In 2019, transfers using traditional money totalled nearly $6 billion - around a fifth of GDP - one of the highest ratios in the world, according to the World Bank. 
The sharp increase in bitcoin transfers mirrors trends across Central America, the data showed, one of the first glimpses of crypto use in El Salvador. Yet its minute use versus traditional remittances suggests the cryptocurrency is still a niche tool for Salvadorans.
Chainalysis, which tracks crypto flows for financial firms and U.S. law enforcement, compiles geographical data by analysing web traffic and trading patterns, though the location of transactions can be obscured by virtual private networks.
El Salvador data for October-January was not available. 
Bitcoin transfers in Central America https://graphics.reuters.com/ELSALVADOR-BITCOIN/oakpebybzvr/chart.png 
REMITTANCE RELIANCE
In its latest report, the World Bank found that for the first three months of 2021, remittances to El Salvador jumped a third year-on-year. Some 95% come from Salvadorans working in the United States, it said.
Bitcoin, in theory, offers a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional and often costly remittance channels. Yet its relative complexity and lack of infrastructure for converting to dollars is widely seen as hampering its use. 
While El Salvador sees bitcoin as a useful way for citizens overseas to send funds home, major remittance firms are cautious about offering cryptocurrency services.
Separately, ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Friday that El Salvador's bitcoin law may imperil a deal on a funding programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The move ""carries risks for the financial system, the stability of the country's monetary regime and signals a lack of a coherent economic framework,"" Moody's said.
The IMF warned on Thursday it had economic and legal concerns over El Salvador's law, widening spreads on the country's bonds.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn Corp another chance to try to stop rival hiQ Labs Inc from harvesting personal data from the professional networking platform's public profiles - a practice that LinkedIn contends threatens the privacy of its users.
The justices threw out a lower court ruling that had barred LinkedIn from denying hiQ access to the information that LinkedIn members had made publicly available.
At issue is whether companies can use a federal anti-hacking law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibits accessing a computer without authorization, to block competitors from harvesting or ""scraping"" vast amounts of customer data from public-facing parts of a website.
The justices sent the dispute back to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider in light of their June 4 ruling that limited https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-supreme-court-limits-reach-federal-computer-fraud-law-2021-06-03 the type of conduct that can be criminally prosecuted under the same law. In that case, the justices found that a person cannot be guilty of violating that law if they misuse information on a computer that they have permission to access.
The LinkedIn case underscores the increasing importance of personal data on the internet and the ability of companies to profit from that information, while raising questions over who can control and use an individual's data - and for what purpose. 
LinkedIn, which has more than 750 million members, told hiQ in 2017 to stop scraping LinkedIn's public profiles or face liability under the anti-hacking law. 
For its part, hiQ uses the data for products that analyze employee skills or alert employers when they could be looking for a new job. It said LinkedIn issued the threat around the same time LinkedIn announced a similar service to hiQ's. 
It sued in federal court, accusing LinkedIn of anti-competitive conduct, and a federal judge in 2017 granted its request for a preliminary injunction against LinkedIn. Explaining its stance, hiQ has said https://www.hiqlabs.com/news-1/2017/8/15/hiq-wins-motion-for-preliminary-injunction-in-landmark-lawsuit-against-linkedinpublic data must remain public and innovation on the internet should not be stifled by anti-competitive hoarding of public data by a small group of powerful companies.
The 9th Circuit in 2019 blocked LinkedIn from cutting off hiQ while the litigation continued, ruling that the law at issue likely does not apply in situations in which no authorization is needed to access the data that users have made publicly available. 

LinkedIn told the Supreme Court that hiQ's software ""bots"" can harvest data on a massive scale, far beyond what any individual person could do when viewing public profiles. 
LinkedIn in April said that some of the publicly viewable data of its users had been scraped https://www.reuters.com/technology/linkedin-says-some-user-data-extracted-posted-sale-2021-04-09 and posted for sale.

MILAN (Reuters) - As the launch of a successor to Alitalia drags on, budget carriers Ryanair and Wizz are bulking up on Italy's domestic routes, grabbing market share from the new carrier before it even takes flight.
Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) is the name of the new state-owned airline independent of bankrupt Alitalia which Rome plans to start, but talks with the European Commission have pushed that back to August at the earliest.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, is expanding to more than 100 domestic routes this summer from 60 before the pandemic. 
It could move ahead of Alitalia on its home turf in the second quarter, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. 
AlixPartners expects Ryanair's slice of domestic seats offered to rise to 35% from 32% before the pandemic while Alitalia shrinks to 32% from 41% in the quarter to June 30. 
Budget players including easyJet (LON:EZJ) could account for up to 67% of domestic flight capacity in the second quarter, AlixPartners said.
That's up from 54% before the pandemic, already well above the European average of around 40%. 
""We are now moving to the next level"" in Italy, by building outbound bases and moving into the ""very significant"" domestic market, Wizz Air CEO Jozsef Varadi told Reuters. 
""This is the right time to show up, when the industry is going through some difficulties.""
Wizz is set to grow from zero to 10% of the domestic market this summer, AlixPartners said. 
""Since they have no competitors, the low-cost airlines do what they want,"" said Franco Gattinoni, chairman of major Italian travel firm Gattinoni. 
""We have left everything in the hands of people who only think about earning and not the well-being of the sector.""
Like many in the market, Gattinoni is concerned budget carriers that quickly add capacity when airport fees are low may disappear just as fast when better opportunities appear elsewhere, a tactic he describes as ""hit and run"". 
In recent months Ryanair and Wizz have commandeered temporary slots at Milan city airport Linate while clinching cut-price deals with secondary airports. 
Both have also stepped up their presence at Alitalia's hub at Rome-Fiumicino with Ryanair doubling the number of planes it has based there this summer to six. 
FLIGHT CONNECTIONS
Crucially, such carriers do not facilitate direct connections with long-haul flights, undermining the prospect of the hub-and-spoke model used by large European rivals such Air France and Lufthansa. 
Ryanair, which for years has been the largest airline flying from Italy to EU countries, says its low fares and direct flights from secondary airports have become an engine of the Italian economy - and that state-run airlines and travel agents have no role in short-haul travel.
""Ryanair is an integral part of Italian life. It has flights that Alitalia never had,"" said Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in Ryanair Group, which says it has 630 routes this summer to and from Italian airports. 
Wilson said the Italian capacity ramp-up was motivated by a post-pandemic surge in domestic travel, but he concedes Ryanair is keen to win converts to low cost just as it did when full-service carriers retrenched in the wake of the 2008 crisis. 
""Flying domestic brings a future customer who can be retained,"" said Michele Mauri, AlixPartners Italy managing director. ""Low-cost carriers are generally very good in managing customer data and in communicating directly with clients.""
The low-cost expansion in Italy mirrors moves across Europe, where full-service airlines are more exposed to long-haul and business travel, sectors expected to be slower to recover.
COVID-19 ""could be a turning point for the three European low-cost carriers,"" said James Halstead, managing partner at Aviation Strategy. 
ITA'S STRATEGY
ITA CEO Fabio Lazzerini in April conceded that Alitalia's lack of market presence had left room for an ""aggressive campaign by competitors"".
He said ITA would clinch a commercial partnership with a full-service airline to counter the expansion of budget rivals. 
That hints at a strategy of indirect competition with the likes of Ryanair and Wizz, allowing it to focus on niches that it can dominate. 
""Losing market share is not necessarily a bad thing. Small is probably beautiful here,"" said Davy Stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong who believes ITA will need to focus on high-margin trunk routes to key global cities, direct long-haul flights to secondary destinations and a few key domestic routes. 

That will make ITA - and Italian aviation - a ""different beast"" to traditional legacy carriers with massive hubs. 
""In the end it has to be a slimmed down operation,"" Furlong said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) shares were weaker by almost 4% in Monday’s trading in line with a two-notch downgrade for the stock by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
In going from buy to sell on the stock, the Wall Street giant cut its target to $207 from $227. The shares are today trading below analyst George Galliers’s estimate.
The analyst does not expect Ferrari to notably benefit from any easing in supplies of semiconductors and improving demand.
Galliers expects Ferrari to hasten its transition to greener technologies and spend more on them. While this will be good for the company in the long-term, the analyst believes it may drive the need for higher capital expenditure.
While a higher capex does not always necessitate a need for more fund-raising, it leaves a that much less money to distribute as dividend or undertake similar investor-friendly measures in the short-term."

LAGOS (Reuters) - Lagos-based entrepreneur Ogechi Egemonu was selling more than 500,000 naira ($1,219) worth of watches, shoes and handbags on Twitter per week. 
Now, with the site suspended by the Nigerian government, Egemonu does not know how she will cope. 
""Social media is where I eat,"" she told Reuters. ""I depend on social media for my livelihood.""
Scores of small and medium-sized businesses across Africa's most populous nation - and largest economy - are reeling from the indefinite suspension of the social media site. 
Nigeria announced the suspension on June 4, days after the platform removed a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened to punish regional separatists. Most telecommunications sites have since blocked access.
NOI Polls estimates that 39.6 million Nigerians use Twitter - 20% of them for business advertisement and 18% to look for employment. Experts warn its lack of ready availability - it is accessible using Virtual Private Networks that mask location - could ripple across the economy. 
""The ban has significant collateral damage,"" said Muda Yusuf, director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce, who said that a ""sizeable number of citizens"" use Twitter to make a living. 
REVENUE LOSS
Parliament's minority caucus warned the suspension was costing Nigerians ""billions of naira on a daily basis."" 
Dumebi Iyeke, a research analyst with the Financial Derivatives Company, said it would hit young Nigerians - among whom there is a 45% unemployment rate - the hardest. 
""We are looking at a potential loss in their revenue,"" Iyeke said, adding that it could further lower living standards amid high inflation. 

Information Minister Lai Mohammed last week said that all social media sites must register a local entity and get a license to operate. He cited complaints over lost money as proof that the ban was effective, but said other sites are still available.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Casino's GPA considers spinning off Colombia's Exito -sources,"By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian food retailer GPA SA is considering a spin off of its Colombian Almacenes Exito SA unit to GPA's shareholders including parent company Casino Guichard Perrachon, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
Such a transaction, similar to GPA's recent spin off of its Brazilian wholesale unit Assai, would fit with part of broader efforts by France's Casino to simplify its structure in Latin America, potentially unlocking more value from its holdings there.
GPA owns almost 97% of Exito, which is listed in Colombia, with a market capitalization of $1.5 billion, leaving it the company, which employs around 35,000 people in 515 supermarkets across the country, with an extremely small free float. The company also operates in Uruguay and Argentina.
GPA, listed on Brazilian stock exchange B3, has a market value of $2.13 billion, suggesting either that the Brazilian parent is worth a fraction of the Colombian unit or that investors are failing to price in the value of its Exito holding. 
The spinoff of wholesale unit Assai from GPA, last March, resulted in an immediate rise of 10% of the companies' combined market capitalization. Assai is currently worth more than double GPA's market cap.
GPA considers the ideal alternative would be to list Exito in Sao Paulo and give Exito shares to its shareholders base. But that is not possible, since B3 does not allow listing of foreign companies. GPA and Casino are considering if the best alternative would be to maintain its listing in Colombia only and issue Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDR) to Brazil-based GPA shareholders, or to list it in another venue, the sources said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) shares rose 2.4% Monday after Raymond James (NYSE:RJF) upgraded the stock to a strong buy.
Analyst Brian Vaccaro’s pegged his target for the stock at $1,800, a nearly 32% upside from its Friday close of $1,366.80.
Chipotle told Bloomberg last week it had increased prices by 3.5% to 4% across its menu.
According to Vaccaro, price increases create significant upside to second-half consensus comparison expectations.
Chipotle announced in May it was hiring 20,000 employees and raising its average hourly wage to $15.
Speaking at an event hosted by investment bank Baird, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol said the company expects average annual unit sales to rise to $3 million to $3.5 million in the near term, compared to the recently reported level of $2.4 million, according to Bloomberg.

Thanks to the Reddit-fueled hype and the ease of stock trading, these two names have gained significantly. But while their rally is reminiscent of GameStops’ massive gains in late January, these two stocks are expected to be extremely volatile. Keeping this in mind, let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) and Nokia Corporation (NOK) have been riding the meme stock wave. Along with stocks such as BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB), GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) and others, these two meme stocks have witnessed double-digit price increases over the past few weeks. While the frenzy began earlier this year with GME’s more than 1,600% gains, AMC has become the latest darling of retail traders, with its shares soaring more than 390% over the past month.
However, meme stocks, which have gone viral on social media irrespective of their financials, are extremely volatile. As such, the huge price gains could be short lived. In fact, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Taba, there could be an ugly ending to the AMC mania. NOK, in contrast, has been witnessing increasing positive cash flow and rising demand for its next-generation connectivity. Since the company is well on track to achieve profitable growth, the momentum in the stock might continue.
While AMC has gained 855.5% year-to-date, NOK has returned 32.1% over the same period. In terms of their past month’s performance, AMC is the clear winner with 391.5% gains versus NOK’s 10.1% returns. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>","Toshiba's chairman resists calls to resign, to bring in new directors","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's chairman on Monday pushed back against calls from shareholders to resign, saying he wanted to help to put things right at the crisis-hit Japanese conglomerate and would bring in new directors.
Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) is in the spotlight after an independent investigation last week alleged that management colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block foreign investors from gaining board influence, in what one top shareholder called the world's worst corporate scandal in a decade.
The shareholder-commissioned investigation has marked an explosive turn in a struggle between Toshiba management and foreign shareholders and has revived concerns about corporate governance in Japan. 
Toshiba, in response to the investigation, has said it would no longer put forward the names of two directors for re-election and that two other executives would also resign.
But this was not enough for proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, which on Monday reiterated that Board Chairman Osamu Nagayama should step down - a call echoed by other investors. 
Nagayama apologised at a news conference on Monday and said there were lapses in governance, but the former pharma executive said he wanted to stay on and help to reconstruct Toshiba's management.
""There's different kinds of responsibility,"" Nagayama said when asked if he would step down to take responsibility for the scandal. ""I want to focus on fulfilling the duties that must be fulfilled.""
The company needs directors with a global perspective and a background managing similar firms, he said, adding that Toshiba would call an extraordinary general meeting and speed up plans for a strategic review. 
Once one of Japan's corporate titans, Toshiba has been hit by accounting scandals and massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business as well as the sale of its semiconductor unit, leaving it a shadow of its former self.
Still, it remains hugely important to the Japanese government as a manufacturer of nuclear reactors and defence equipment.
THE BLAME GAME
The investigation's findings mark a critical turn in a long-running battle between management and foreign shareholders, which include Effissimo, a Singapore-based fund, and 3D Investment Partners.
3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's second-largest shareholder, on Sunday also called for the resignation of Nagayama and other company executives.
Nagayama, at the news conference, blamed Toshiba's former CEO, Nobuaki Kurumatani, for helping to pitch the company into crisis.
""We cannot ignore responsibility of Mr. Kurumatani for creating management turmoil and damaging shareholder trust,"" he said. He said the former chief executive had taken a ""confrontational stance"" toward shareholders, leading to the discord.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Kurumatani for comment. Toshiba said it was not in a position to provide his contact details.
One investor, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Nagayama should step down.
""It rings hollow for Chairman Nagayama... to try and shift the blame to just Kurumatani alone,"" the investor told Reuters.
""If anyone should resign to take responsibility over the governance failures in monitoring management, it should be him.""
CHANGE IN JAPAN?
Toshiba has faced and dismissed a $20 billion bid from CVC Capital. But leading shareholders have called on it to explicitly seek offers from potential suitors.
Nagayama said the company has not received offers from private equity funds since CVC, but said the new committee for the strategic review would consider various options.
He said he wanted to include two of the company's foreign directors in the four- or five-member strategic review committee. Toshiba currently has four foreign directors among its 11-member board.
Some investors have said that the independent investigation into Toshiba and its startling findings do show some progress in Japan's corporate governance.
Former Olympus Corp CEO Michael Woodford, who blew the whistle on a $1.7 billion accounting scandal at the Japanese medical equipment maker in 2011, said the investigators' report was potentially a sign of improvement in Japan. 

""This time what offers some hope that things may be really changing is that a shareholders' commissioned investigation by outside lawyers has been explicit in its findings, and that these have actually seen the light of day,"" he told Reuters.
""That several of Toshiba's major shareholders have apparently also been demanding, albeit in private, accountability by seeking the resignation of the company's chairman is very different to the total silence I encountered of Olympus's institutional shareholders in 2011.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Top development banks from the world's richest countries made a landmark joint pledge on Monday to pump $80 billion into African companies and projects over the next five years.
The International Monetary Fund has estimated sub-Saharan Africa will need an additional $425 billion between now and 2025 to fight COVID-19 and reduce poverty levels now being exacerbated by the pandemic.
The region is also being hit hard by climate change and Monday's $80 billion pledge was the first time the Development Finance Institutions (DFI) from the United States, Europe and other Group of Seven wealthy nations have made a collective commitment to the African continent.David Marchick, chief operating officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) said investing more in Africa was now ""a top priority"" under the Biden administration, while the head of the European Investment Bank, Werner Hoyer, which injected over 5 billion euros ($6 billion) into Africa last year, said it was ready to co-operate further with African and multilateral partners.
The step comes as Western nations fight to counter rapidly expanding Chinese and Russian economic and political influence in Africa with its fast-growing populations and vast mineral resources.
Monday's pledge followed the G7's weekend promise to provide 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries over the next year and news that they were also looking at reallocating another $100 billion from the IMF's war chest to help with the economic fallout.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and global vaccine charities launched the COVAX programme last April to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to some of the world's poorest people.

The scheme has faced setbacks though: production glitches, a lack of support from wealthy nations and a recent move by India, the biggest vaccine manufacturer, to curb its exports following its own massive spike in cases.

Investing.com – Philips (NYSE:PHG) shares fell close to 5% in Monday’s premarket trading following the company’s decision to voluntarily recall certain breathing devices and ventilators on concerns they could harm the patients.
It is recalling Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (Bi-Level PAP), Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), and mechanical ventilator devices.
A certain kind of foam, polyester-based polyurethane, is used to muffle the noise generated during use of these devices.
Philips said the PE-PUR foam may degrade into particles which may enter the device’s air pathway and be ingested or inhaled by the user, and the foam may off-gas certain chemicals.
The foam degradation may be exacerbated by use of unapproved cleaning methods. High heat and high humidity environments may also contribute to foam degradation, the company said in a note.
Philips will replace the current sound abatement foam with a new material and has already begun the preparations, which include obtaining the relevant regulatory clearances.
The company has advised patients to consult their physician before taking any action and weigh between the risks of continuing the therapy and those identified in the recall notification.
The Dutch medical and consumer group had in its April 26 communication said it had ""identified a quality issue in a component that is used in certain sleep and respiratory care products, and are initiating all precautionary actions to address this issue, for which we have taken a EUR 250 million ($302.5 million) provision"". 
The recall notwithstanding, the company is sticking to its April 26 forecast of delivering “low-to-mid-single-digit comparable sales growth for the group in 2021 with an adjusted EBITA margin improvement of 60-80 basis points."" Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin in fiscal 2020 was 13.2%.
The company said the corrective action has inflated costs by 250 million euros ($302 million), on top of the 250 million euros already provisioned.  "

Chief judge Hideo Nirei, one of three judges presiding over their first court appearance, asked Michael Taylor and his son Peter whether there was any mistake in the charges submitted by the Tokyo Prosecutors' office. 
""No your honour,"" the older Taylor replied. ""No,"" said his son. 
Extradited to Japan from the United States in March, they are being held at the same jail in Tokyo where Ghosn was detained. They could face up to three years in prison.
Wearing black jackets and pants, white shirts and plastic slippers, they were led into court with ropes threaded through handcuffs and tied around their waists.
Prosecutors accused them of helping Ghosn evade punishment and escape https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nissan-ghosn-charge-idCAKBN2BE0G1 to Lebanon from western Japan's Kansai airport, receiving $1.3 million for their services, some of which was paid to an advertising company owned by the younger Taylor. The Americans asked Ghosn for another $500,000 for legal fees after Japan sought their arrest, prosecutors said. 
They also described the younger Taylor as a frequent visitor to Lebanon, said planning for the escape began around six months before Ghosn fled. 
Their statement also said that Ghosn's wife Carole Ghosn sought help from Michael Taylor, with Ghosn later contacting him from Tokyo with a phone he had hidden from Japanese authorities. 
A third man George-Antoine Zayek, recruited by the Taylors, traveled to Japan later in 2019 to find a way through airport security, settling on the private jet terminal at Kansai airport as the best route out, the prosecutors said. Zayek remains at large.
Luggage that does not fit through the security scanning machine there is inspected by hand. That check, however, can be waived by the pilot.
The Taylors' lawyers in the United States waged a months-long battle to prevent their extradition to Japan, arguing they could not be prosecuted for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that they could face relentless interrogations and torture.
Suspects in Japan are interrogated without their lawyers present and are often denied bail before trial. 
Japan's conviction rate is 99%.
At the time of Ghosn's escape, he was awaiting trial on charges that he understated his compensation in Nissan's financial statements by 9.3 billion yen ($85 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. 
Ghosn - who denies any wrongdoing - remains a fugitive in his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.

Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive charged with helping Ghosn hide his earnings, is also standing trial in Tokyo. He denies the charges https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/court-former-nissan-executive-kelly-denies-helping-ghosn-hide-earnings-2021-05-12.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Monday, remaining near record levels, heading into a week that includes a keenly-awaited Federal Reserve meeting. 
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up just 5 points, or less than 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 50 points, or 0.3%.
The three major indices closed just higher Friday, with the broad-based S&P 500 ending up 0.2%, at a new record high. The blue-chip Dow gained under 0.1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4% higher, helped by a rotation back into growth names.
The Fed’s two-day policy meeting, ending Wednesday, will likely limit activity in the early part of the week. The central bank is not expected to take any immediate action, but investors will be focusing on the statement to see whether the policy makers open discussions about how and when to taper the $120 billion in monthly central bank bond purchases.
While inflation is currently running red hot, U.S. employers have added fewer than half of the 2 million jobs that Fed chief Jerome Powell had suggested he was hoping for after the Fed's April policy meeting.
“While the Fed may be a little nearer to discussing tapering, we are not looking for the statement, new projections or Chair Powell’s press conference to unsettle markets,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “After all markets seem quite comfortable with the view that Fed tapering could start in December this year, with the first rate hike in early 2023.”
In corporate news,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose premarket Monday after the drugmaker reported that late-stage data from its U.S.-based clinical trial showed its vaccine is more than 90% effective against Covid-19 across a variety of variants of the virus.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after CEO Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend that the electric car manufacturer will resume Bitcoin transactions once it confirms there is reasonable clean energy usage by miners. 
Crude oil prices pushed higher Monday, trading near multi-year highs, helped by an improved outlook for demand as increased Covid-19 vaccinations push global travel back to near normalcy.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.6% at $71.35 a barrel, climbing to its highest level since October 2018, and on course for a fifth quarterly advance, which would be the best run since 2010. Brent was up 0.7% at $73.22, around its highest since May 2019.
U.S. daily air travelers have topped 2 million for the first time since the pandemic began with traffic returning to pre-pandemic levels in North America and much of Europe as lockdowns and other restrictions are being eased, although the U.K. could throw a spanner in the works later Monday.

The bond inflows were in contrast to the outflows experienced by regional equity markets last month, however, the net purchases in Asian bonds were the lowest in four months due to worries over a resurgence of regional coronavirus cases.
Overseas investors bought a net $4.7 billion worth of Asian bonds last month, the lowest since January this year, data from regulatory authorities and bond market associations showed.

""Because of South Korea's strong growth recovery and shorter timeline to policy lift-off, 10Y Korean bond yields have been trading at historically wide spreads to U.S. Treasuries and other peer EM low-yielders,"" said Duncan Tan, a strategist at DBS Bank.
""Even on an FX-hedged basis, Korean bonds also continue to offer consistently high pick-ups over U.S. Treasuries.""

On the other hand, Indonesia and Indian bonds faced outflows worth $501 million and $237 million, respectively.
Jennifer Kusuma, Asia rates strategist at ANZ, said she sees more room for foreign investor flows into the region, facilitated by improving global risk sentiment and as vaccination drives gather pace in a number of economies in Asia.

""For the region, the improved performance of Chinese asset markets may also develop into a fresh driver of strength. We expect better buying interest for LCY (local currency) bonds near term,"" she said.

Upon regulatory approvals, Novavax remains on track to reach manufacturing capacity of 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said in a release.
Once authorized, the Novavax vaccine would join  Pfizer  BioNTech (NYSE:PFE) (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the three COVID-19 shots already approved for emergency use in the U.S.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>","Philips recalls ventilators, sleep apnea machines due to health risks","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Dutch medical equipment company Philips has recalled some breathing devices and ventilators because of a foam part that might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer, it said on Monday. 
Foam used to dampen the machines' sound can degrade and emit small particles that irritate airways, the group said as it announced the recall. Gases released by the degrading foam may also be toxic or carry cancer risks.
Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said the company was one of the largest makers of sleep apnea machines and ventilators. Between 3 million and 4 million would be targeted in the recall, he said.
The group took a 250 million euro ($303 million) charge for the issue after announcing an identical provision in its first quarter-earnings report in April, bringing the total cost of the problem to 500 million euros to date.
Shares in the group were down 4.2% to 44.42 euros by 0850 GMT in Amsterdam.
""We're going to put all our capacity to focus entirely on replacing and repairing these units,"" Van Houten said in a call, a process he said would likely take a year.
That ""has a consequence that we will not be able to serve new customers, so there's going to be a shortage in the field"".
Company spokesman Steve Klink said about 80% of the affected devices were machines used to help people with sleep apnea, known as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines. Users of those machines were advised to halt usage. Around two-thirds of Philips CPAP machine sales are in the United States.
The other 20% of affected devices were ventilators. Doctors and patients using life-sustaining ventilators should first consider whether the potential danger from the foam outweighs other risks, the company said.
""Philips has received reports of possible patient impact due to foam degradation,"" the company said in a statement. ""To date, there have been no reports of death as a result of these issues.""
Spokesman Klink said Philips had received some complaints about the devices, representing 0.03% of those sold in 2020. 
The company said the matter would cause ""revenue headwinds"" in the division making the devices but that would be compensated by strength in other businesses. 
It left its full-year financial guidance of ""low-to-mid-single-digit"" comparable sales growth unchanged.
Philips said it was working with health authorities on a safe replacement for the foam, but that it must first clear testing and regulatory hurdles.

In April, Philips said first-quarter core earnings surged 74% to 362 million euros compared with the same period a year earlier, on a 9% rise in comparable sales.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Dress to impress: Ted Baker says formal wear back in demand,"By Muvija M and Chris Peters
(Reuters) -Upmarket retailer Ted Baker said on Monday dresses and suits were back in demand, with Britons rediscovering a taste for formal wear as months of COVID-19 curbs on social life were slowly relaxed.
A lockdown-driven shift to casual wear hammered the fashion retailer's earnings last year, but its new boss said the performance of Ted Baker stores since their reopening in April was ""very pleasing"".
""Most recently we are seeing dresses back to the same level (in the) mix of our business as it was two years ago,"" Rachel Osborne told Reuters. ""(We) are seeing people coming in for suits, the wedding season is hopefully starting.""
Ted Baker shares were up 1.2% at 0754 GMT after the group reported a 59.2 million pound ($83.53 million) pretax loss for the 12 months to Jan. 30, narrower than the 76 million pound loss forecast by analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Osborne, who took over last year, has been working on winning back customers and investor trust after a string of setbacks that followed the departure of previous chief executive and founder Ray Kelvin following misconduct allegations. 
Kelvin has denied any wrongdoing.
The company, which cut nearly 1,000 jobs and raised money through a stock issue to get through the crisis, is undergoing a three-year turnaround plan focused on saving 31 million pounds a year.
It also plans to strengthen its online presence, with 11 million pounds earmarked for its e-commerce site's revamp. 
""Ted Baker needs to find a way to sustainably improve its online business, or it won't bode well for trading patterns in the post-pandemic, digital-centric world,"" Hargreaves analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.
While overall sales slumped by 44% to 352 million pounds in fiscal 2021, online sales leapt 22%, though growth slowed to 4.5% in the first quarter of the current year with fewer discounts and other promotions. 

Osborne said the company had also introduced more casual wear, such as joggers and sleepwear, for lockdown times. ""All those really took off as a percentage mix of our business that we hadn't seen pre-COVID.""

The country's largest lender announced the appointment of Jan Emeryk Rosciszewski, formerly a deputy head of the bank, as chief executive last week after the surprise resignation of Zbigniew Jagiello in May.
""We want to return to regular dividend payments. I hope that it will happen next year, it will be dependent on the decision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF),"" Rosciszewski was quoted as saying.
The KNF told banks not to pay dividends in the first half of 2021 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Rosciszewski said that PKO BP would stick to its plan to offer Swiss-franc mortgage holders settlements. 
The KNF proposed in December that lenders could offer voluntary settlements to their clients, including retrospectively settling Swiss-franc mortgages as zloty loans.
PKO BP, the Polish bank with the largest portfolio of Swiss-franc loans, is the only bank that has so far committed to the plan, with others waiting for a ruling from the Supreme Court on the issue before taking a decision. The PKO BP settlement plan is worth 6.7 billion zloty ($1.8 billion).
""The direction of our activities remains unchanged, we want to offer the settlements announced by us earlier... The solution is currently being piloted,"" he said.
Rosciszewski also said that in the near future PKO wants to focus more on the development of insurance products.
""Our goal is to make PKO BP a wholesaler of insurance sales - in terms of financial products, health, life and property or motor insurance,"" he said.

Clariant said it would reinvest to become a 20% shareholder in the new combined business, which employs 3,000 people and has annual sales of around 900 million euros ($1.09 billion). 
The deal represented an enterprise value of 805 to 855 million francs, depending on an earn-out payment based on the 2021 financial performance of the business which makes pigments and dyes used in the automotive, plastics and other industries. 
Clariant said the sale, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022, represented a multiple of 10.7 to 11.4 times the standalone EBITDA of the pigments business in the year to April 2021.
The sale is the final stage in the divestment and repositioning programme announced by Basel-based Clariant in July 2018, said Chief Executive Conrad Keijzer.
The company has already divested its healthcare packaging and masterbatches business as it seeks to grow faster than its markets, and raise profit margins. 
""Now our focus can fully be on growing revenue and profitability of our core business areas: Care Chemicals, Catalysis and Natural Resources,"" Keijzer said.
In addition to funding the reinvestment, proceeds will go into funding organic growth of Clariant, as well as strengthening the company's balance sheet.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2021 11:25PM ET</span>",Mall owner Washington Prime files for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,"(Reuters) -Mall owner Washington Prime Group (NYSE:WPG) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close some of its roughly 100 shopping centers across the United States and businesses were unable to pay it rent.
The company's estimated assets ranged from $1 billion to $10 billion as did its estimated liabilities, according to a filing made in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
Reuters earlier reported that the Columbus, Ohio-based company, formed in 2014 following a spin-off from mall giant Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), was preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week.
The company said it has secured $100 million of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations during bankruptcy proceedings, adding it entered a restructuring support agreement with creditors led by SVPGlobal.
The agreement provides for a deleveraging of the company's balance sheet by nearly $950 million, Washington Prime said on Sunday. The agreement contemplates a $325 million equity rights offering, according to the company.
Fallout from the pandemic last year forced Washington Prime to close some properties for a time and relax collection of rent from its tenants, squeezing the mall owner's finances.
During the throes of the pandemic in 2020, Washington Prime's rental income plummeted about $127 million from 2019 levels due to the coronavirus outbreak.
During the first three months of this year, Washington Prime's rental income was off roughly $20 million compared with the same time in 2020. Its cash flows from operations for the three months ending in March were $3.3 million, a plunge from $10 million during the same time in 2020.
The U.S. economy is now sharply rebounding with more than 140 million Americans fully vaccinated and businesses reopening.
Nevertheless, previous government stay-at-home orders and business closures designed to slow the pandemic crushed many retailers' bottom lines, imperiling their ability to pay rent to landlords such as Washington Prime.
Other mall owners such as CBL & Associates Properties Inc and Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment (NYSE:PEI) Trust filed for bankruptcy last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, facing a deepening crisis over corporate governance, said on Sunday it will change its board director nominees for an upcoming shareholder meeting, as two are stepping down.
The shake-up follows an investigation that found the company had colluded with the Japanese government to pressure foreign investors, a revelation that its second-largest shareholder called the greatest corporate governance scandal in the world in the last decade.
The report was commissioned by shareholders, who voted in March for an independent investigation into allegations investors had come under pressure from the company.
Audit committee chair Junji Ota and audit committee member Takashi Yamauchi will retire as board directors, the company said in a statement, following a four-hour long emergency board meeting.
Toshiba's audit committee has come under scrutiny as the investigation alleged the committee failed to take any action even when it became aware of Toshiba's attempt to prevent shareholders from exercising their rights.
Toshiba also said two executives, Masayasu Toyohara and Masaharu Kamo, will leave this month. The report alleged these two reached out to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) for support ahead of Toshiba's annual general meeting last July.
In the statement, Toshiba said it ""will take action to identify the root cause without delay, in an objective and transparent manner, including the participation of third parties.""
The board, particularly chairman Osamu Nagayama, is likely to continue to face repercussions from the report in the run-up to the annual shareholders meeting on June 25.
Earlier on Sunday, 3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's second-biggest shareholder, wrote in a letter to the chairman and the three audit committee members calling for their immediate resignations.
3D's letter, seen by Reuters, describes Nagayama as ""ultimately responsible for Toshiba's recent governance failures, including the flawed internal investigation and the board's determination to oppose an outside, independent investigation.""
Quiddity Advisors analyst Travis Lundy, who writes on online commentary platform Smartkarma, also questioned the responsibilities of Nagayama, who also serves as nomination committee chairman. 
""The problem with a board, and most particularly an audit committee is that someone is supposed to watch the watcher. That is Nagayama-san's job,"" he said.
Shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc has recommended that shareholders should vote against the re-appointment of Nagayama, saying that he should be held responsible for the re-appointments of audit committee members.

A Toshiba spokeswoman said such criticism should be mitigated as the two audit committee members are now leaving. Toshiba declined to make the chairman or executives Toyohara and Kamo available for comment.
Four independent directors, who on Friday called for a shake-up of Toshiba's management and board, released a statement welcoming the announced changes.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2021 08:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Energy majors bid for Qatar LNG project despite lower returns,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Six top western energy firms are vying to partner in the vast expansion of Qatar's liquefied natural gas output, industry sources said, helping the Gulf state cement its position as the leading LNG producer while several large projects around the world recently stalled.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), TotalEnergies and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), which are part of Qatar's existing LNG production were joined by new entrants  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Italy's Eni in submitting bids on May 24 for the expansion project, industry sources told Reuters.
The bids show energy giants continue to have appetite for investing in competitive oil and gas projects despite growing government, investor and activist pressure on the sector to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.
Unlike Qatar's early LNG projects in the 1990s and 2000s when the country relied heavily on international oil companies' technical expertise and deep pockets, the country's national oil company Qatar Petroleum (QP) has gone ahead alone with the development of the nearly $30 billion North Field expansion project.
It is, however, seeking to partner with the oil majors in order to share the financial risk of the development and help sell the additional volumes of LNG it will produce. 
""I don't think QP need the IOCs expertise in the upstream or midstream construction of the project but they will be glad to see someone take some LNG volumes off their hands,"" a senior source in one of the bidding companies said.
Qatar plans to grow its LNG output by 40% to 110 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2026, strengthening its position as the world leading exporter of the super-chilled fuel.
An Eni spokesperson confirmed the company is participating in the bidding process. QP, Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies, Conoco declined to comment. 
Exxon said it did not comment on market rumours, but added: ""We look forward to continuing success in future projects with our partners Qatar Petroleum and the State of Qatar. ExxonMobil affiliates are working with Qatar Petroleum to identify international joint venture opportunities that further enhance the portfolio of both.""
Leading energy companies see natural gas as a key fuel in the world's efforts to cut carbon emissions and replace the more polluting coal, although the International Energy Agency said in a report last month that investments in new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order to meet U.N.-backed targets aimed at limiting global warming.
Activists say that expansion in natural gas delays a transition to renewable energy that is needed to meet U.N.-backed targets to battle climate change. The European Union is in the midst of a debate about what role gas should take in the energy transition. 
The outlook for global LNG supplies tightened sharply in recent months after Total suspended its $20 billion LNG project in Mozambique due to a surge in violence.
It followed a string of delays of LNG projects in North America as COVID-19 hobbled demand last year.
Global LNG demand has increased every year since 2012 and hit record highs every year since 2015 mostly due to fast-rising demand in Asia. Analysts have said they expect global LNG demand will grow about 3-5% each year between 2021 and 2025. 
LOWER RETURNS
The interest from companies in the Qatari expansion comes despite relatively low returns.
QP offered international bidders returns of around 8% to 10% on their investment, down from around 15% to 20% returns Exxon, Total, Shell and Conoco have seen from the early LNG facilities, according to sources in three companies involved.
Qatar project returns have never previously been disclosed. 
The six companies and QP declined to comment on the terms of the bids.
""Clearly Qatar has become more competitive,"" a source said. ""But it remains very low risk from the resource perspective.""
The results of the tender process are not expected to be announced before September, two of the sources said.
In March, QP said it will take full ownership of Qatargas 1 LNG plant when its 25-year contract with international investors including Exxon and TotalEnergies expires next year, in a sign of its growing confidence.

Qatar is also in talks to make Chinese firms partners in the project, sources told Reuters last month. 
QP last month hired international banks for a multi-billion dollar debut public bond sale by the end of June, two sources said, to help in part development the Northern Field project.

One of Microsoft's big-ticket games, ""Halo Infinite,"" is now set for a holiday launch this year after being delayed due to the challenge of developers being stuck at home during coronavirus restrictions.
Several of the game launches announced by Microsoft at the E3 conference came from video game publisher Bethesda, behind hits such as Fallout and Doom. Microsoft last year bought ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda, for $7.5 billion.
Microsoft also announced launch dates of two big-budget games, exclusive to Xbox and PC - role playing game ""Starfield"" and vampire-themed shooting game ""Redfall."" ""Starfield"" will launch on Nov. 11, 2022 and ""Redfall"" next Summer. 
Both Microsoft and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) launched their next-generation gaming devices in November last year and have seen heightened demand for the consoles as gamers stuck at home due to the pandemic snapped up the devices.
Gaming analytics firm Newzoo forecasts that the global games market will generate revenue of $175.8 billion in 2021, with 2.9 billion players, and surpass $200 billion in 2023.
Microsoft has also been developing its cloud gaming service to attract casual gamers and its own streaming devices. 

Game Pass has hundreds of games playable on Xbox consoles, Android devices and PCs with a $9.99 monthly fee. 
""What makes us different from a service like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is that we give players both options, a subscription package and also a full retail store,"" said Phil Spencer, head of Xbox.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Fed meeting looms for stocks as inflation worries collide with 'Goldilocks' markets,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors will be zeroing in on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting next week as a ""Goldilocks"" market environment that has helped lift stocks to record highs and tamed a bond selloff is tested by rising inflation.
Stocks have climbed steadily in recent weeks and now stand at fresh records, extending a rally that has seen the S&P 500 gain 13% this year and nearly 90% from its March 2020 low. U.S. government bonds have also rallied after their first-quarter selloff, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to prices, recently at 1.46%, some 30 basis points below its first quarter highs.
Some of those gains have been predicated on the Fed’s assurances that rising inflation will not last long enough to warrant a sooner-than-expected end to easy-money policies. Signals that the Fed is growing less confident in those assumptions could unsettle stocks, which have benefited from quantitative easing, and hurt bonds, as rising prices erode the value of longer-dated debt.
Investors “are going to be looking for signs that the Fed might believe that inflation is more permanent,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. 
The Fed has maintained that it has the tools to deal with accelerating inflation. The central bank may open discussion at the Tuesday-Wednesday meeting about when to begin unwinding its $120 billion per month purchases of government bonds, though most analysts don't expect a decision before the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference in August.
For now, it appears some investors are coming around to the Fed’s way of thinking on inflation. Stocks on Thursday brushed off data showing that consumer prices rose in May at their fastest annual pace in 13 years, as the S&P 500 hit a new record. By contrast, a much higher-than-expected inflation number last month caused a selloff in stocks.
Strong inflation numbers aside, recent data has offered snapshots of an economy that is strengthening but does not appear to be close to overheating. Employment, for instance, remains about 7.6 million jobs below its February 2020 peak while the latest monthly report fell short of economists estimates.
""We are making progress, but the economy is not completely on fire and a runaway train where the Fed has to take action,"" said Chris Galipeau, senior market strategist at Putnam Investments. ""That puts us in the 'Goldilocks' scenario.""
Still, others worry that markets have grown too complacent on inflation and other risks that could derail the current rally, from potential higher taxes to peaking economic growth rates.
Analysts at BofA Global Research on Friday outlined a number of reasons that inflation may be more sustained than many expect, including second-tier indicators such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses survey of small businesses showing price pressures are filtering to customers.
“The list of excuses for transitory inflation is getting long. The risk of higher, more persistent inflation is growing,” BofA’s analysts wrote.
More broadly, bullish sentiment among individual investors has been above its historical average of 38% for 25 of the last 30 weeks, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. Bearish sentiment, meanwhile, is below its historical average of 30.5% for the 18th consecutive week.
“At current levels, pessimism remains unusually low,” the AAII said on its website. “Historically, below-average readings for bearish sentiment have been followed by below-average six- and 12-month returns for the S&P 500 index.”
Bulls can point to plenty of reasons for stocks to remain strong. Most investors believe the Fed will only start tapering its bond purchases in late 2021 or early next year. Bets in the eurodollar futures markets show investors believe the Fed will start hiking its benchmark rate in late 2022.
Rising estimates for corporate profit growth are also supporting stocks. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to jump 36% this year, compared to an April estimate of 26% growth, with earnings expected to rise another roughly 12% in 2022, according to Refinitiv IBES.
That has not stopped some of the world’s biggest banks, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), from warning in recent months that the market is primed for a sharp pullback.

Zhejiang-based Geely, among a small number of automakers developing methanol-powered vehicles, is testing methanol taxis in some western Chinese cities as well as developing methanol-powered trucks at its commercial vehicles unit.
Li said Geely, which owns Volvo Cars and 9.7% stake in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), invested in Carbon Recycling International, an Icelandic company, to work on technologies to produce methanol with carbon dioxide, in a way to lower overall carbon emissions.
""We will keep exploring methanol vehicle technologies. Of course it might fail in the end, but currently we are still working on it,"" Li told an industry conference in the western city of Chongqing, without elaborating.
Methanol fuel would boost China's energy independence as the country has huge amounts of coal, which can be converted to methanol. Geely's Li has also said he expects methanol vehicles to be cleaner than gasoline models.
Li did not offer details of the technology. He has told Reuters that Geely would expand production of methanol-powered vehicles. 

Geely is also developing battery electric vehicles, petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen commercial vehicles.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Washington Prime to file bankruptcy as soon as this week - sources,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mall owner Washington Prime Group (NYSE:WPG) Inc is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close some of its roughly 100 shopping centers across the United States and businesses were unable to pay it rent, people familiar with the matter said.
The Columbus, Ohio-based company, formed in 2014 following a spin-off from mall giant Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), owns properties that include open-air town centers and enclosed malls, with roughly a third concentrated in the Midwest. Its tenants include brand-name retailers pushed to the brink by the pandemic, such as J.C. Penney Co Inc, which filed for bankruptcy last year. Other tenants include retailers that borrowed money last year to bolster their finances during the crisis such as  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) and Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M)
The real estate investment trust's consideration of a Chapter 11 court restructuring to rework roughly $4 billion of debt marks the latest company in the broader retail landscape to wilt under a global public health crisis that kept U.S. shoppers home for months on end.
The U.S. economy is now sharply rebounding with more than 140 million Americans fully vaccinated and businesses reopening. Nevertheless, previous government stay-at-home orders and business closures designed to slow the pandemic crushed many retailers' bottom lines, imperiling their ability to pay rent to landlords such as Washington Prime. Other mall owners such as CBL & Associates Properties Inc and Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment (NYSE:PEI) Trust filed for bankruptcy last year.
Washington Prime did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company could be put up for sale in concert with the expected bankruptcy filing, one of the sources said. It is in talks for roughly $100 million of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations during bankruptcy proceedings, the source said.
The size of the financing will depend on whether Washington Prime reaches a debt restructuring deal with creditors before filing for bankruptcy or needs to continue negotiations while navigating court proceedings, in which case it could approach $150 million, the source added.
Washington Prime has said in public filings that it is in talks with creditors to restructure its finances and might need to seek bankruptcy protection.
The company has not yet made a final decision on whether it will seek bankruptcy protection, some of the sources said. The timing of any bankruptcy filing, should one occur, could slip depending on the progress of ongoing talks with creditors, these sources said.
Washington Prime is currently operating under a forbearance agreement with bondholders and lenders that expires  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY) night. The agreement has been extended several times since Washington Prime skipped a $23.2 million interest payment on bonds due Feb. 15.
The discussions have dragged on as negotiators wrestle with Washington Prime's improved business prospects and the potential that creditors might realize better financial recoveries, the sources familiar with the proceedings said. Washington Prime's stock soared earlier this year before falling, and experienced another brief surge in early June.
The talks include investment firm SVPGlobal, among Washington Prime's largest creditors, the sources said.
SVPGlobal declined to comment.
Fallout from the pandemic last year forced Washington Prime to close some properties for a time and relax collection of rent from its tenants, squeezing the mall owner's finances. During the throes of the pandemic in 2020, Washington Prime's rental income plummeted about $127 million from 2019 levels due to the pandemic.
During the first three months of this year, Washington Prime's rental income was off roughly $20 million compared with the same time period in 2020. Its cash flows from operations for the three months ending in March were $3.3 million, a plunge from $10 million during the same time period in 2020.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -A seat on a spaceship ride with billionaire Jeff Bezos went for $28 million during a live auction on Saturday, concluding the month-long bidding process for the sightseeing trip on the Blue Origin's maiden voyage next month. 
Within four minutes of the open of Saturday's live phone auction, bids reached beyond $20 million. The bidding closed seven minutes after the auction began. The identity of the winner - presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado - was not immediately disclosed. 
The July 20 launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard booster from West Texas would be a landmark moment as U.S. firms strive toward a new era of private commercial space travel.
Blue Origin's founder and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and a lifelong space enthusiast, has been racing against fellow aspiring billionaire aeronauts Richard Branson and Elon Musk to be the first of the three to travel beyond Earth's atmosphere.
""To see the earth from space, changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity,"" Bezos said in a video before the final bidding took place, adding that his brother Mark will join him on the trip. 
As the month-long bidding process leading up to the live auction closed on Thursday, the winning figure stood at $4.8 million, fueled by entries from more than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries, Blue Origin said. 
""Putting the world's richest man and one of the most recognized figures in business into space is a massive advertisement for space as a domain for exploration, industrialization and investment,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas told clients earlier this month.
While the funds raised from the event are earmarked for charity, Blue Origin is hoping to galvanize enthusiasm for its nascent suborbital tourism business.
However, Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc, may attempt to steal Bezos' thunder by joining a possible test flight to the edge of space over the July 4 weekend aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane, one person familiar with the matter said. 
The race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall, fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.
Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, as well as Musk's SpaceX, have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities. UBS says that long-haul travel market could be worth more than $20 billion, though several barriers such as air-safety certification could derail the plans.

Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips. 
Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's second-biggest shareholder on Sunday demanded the board chairman and three other directors immediately resign after an investigation found the company had colluded with the Japanese government to pressure foreign investors.
The letter, seen by Reuters, is from 3D Investment Partners, which owns a 7.2% stake in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY). It was sent to the four on Sunday, according to people with direct knowledge of the process.
It is likely to heighten scrutiny into governance at Toshiba, a renowned industrial conglomerate in crisis sparked by Thursday's report. The shareholder-commissioned report marked an explosive turn in a long battle between the Japanese company's management and foreign shareholders. 
In addition to 3D, these shareholders include activist investors and Harvard University's endowment fund.
The revelations in the report ""are deeply troubling and represent one of the most prominent and shocking corporate governance failures among large public companies anywhere in the world in the last decade,"" the 3D letter says.
The letter, addressed to board chair Osamu Nagayama and three current audit committee members, describes Nagayama as ""ultimately responsible for Toshiba's recent governance failures, including the flawed internal investigation and the board's determination to oppose an outside, independent investigation.""
""It is also troubling that you have been silent about the investigative report and have failed to accept responsibility for the misconduct that occurred under your oversight as chair of the board,"" the letter says.
Toshiba declined to comment on the letter, telling Reuters in a statement it was ""carefully reviewing the content of the investigation report and plans to announce its comments towards this investigation result after the review.""

The company was holding an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss reassigning the candidates for three key board committees ahead of a June 25 shareholder meeting. Major shareholder advisory firms recommended against some of the candidates, including the four addressed in the 3D letter.
Four independent directors, all non-Japanese, have said in a sign of revolt that they were no longer in support of the full slate of director candidates nominated by Toshiba.

Germany is Amazon's biggest market after the United States, and the Verdi union has been organising strikes at Amazon in the country since 2013 to protest low pay and poor conditions. 
The pay increase is effective from July and compares with entry-level pay as low as 11.30 euros per hour for some locations, though pay exceeded 12 euros in other locations.
Amazon's wages exceed Germany's current minimum wage of 9.50 euros per hour. But workers have regularly gone on strike, such as last year to coincide with the $1.6 trillion company's global ""Prime Day"" promotion event. They were disgruntled that a coronavirus bonus had been scrapped.
A Verdi official said that the increase was the least that the company could do after ""earning a pretty penny in recent months"" and that pay still fell short of its demands for many employees. 
Amazon - which saw net profit rise to $8.1 billion in the first quarter, more than tripling from $2.5 billion the year earlier - has faced similar criticism over conditions and pay throughout the globe. 

A spokesperson for Amazon in Germany said all employees would be getting a raise, and Amazon said in a statement that further increases were scheduled for the future.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp directors will hold an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss reassigning the candidates for three key board committees ahead of a June 25 shareholder meeting, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Japanese conglomerate's board will consider reassigning the candidates for the audit, nominating and compensation committees, after major shareholder advisory firms recommended against some of the candidates, the people said.
They declined to be identified because the information is not public.
The emergency meeting comes as Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) has been thrown into crisis by revelations this week that management and board members colluded with the Japanese government to pressure foreign investors.
The people gave no further detail on the reassignment of the candidates. Toshiba said in a statement it does not disclose the schedule or topics of board meetings.
According to a shareholder-commissioned investigation released on Thursday, Toshiba's leadership reached out to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to get it to ""beat up"" foreign shareholders.
Adding to the pressure, shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) on Saturday recommended that shareholders should vote against the re-appointment of board chairman Osamu Nagayama and four other directors.
Four of the company's independent directors, all non-Japanese, have already said they were no longer in support of the full slate of director candidates nominated by Toshiba.
ISS singled out current members of the nomination and audit committees. 
""One could argue that as the investigation report was just released on June 10, there was no time to change director candidates,"" ISS said in its report, which was seen by Reuters.

However, it added it was ""unthinkable that members of the nomination committee were unaware of the significance of the incident and accompanying shareholder concerns,"" as allegations have long been raised, it said.
Glass Lewis, another U.S. advisory firm, has also urged shareholders at this year's AGM to vote against the re-appointment of the same five directors.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong bankers and lawyers will be able to search the city's companies registry under proposed exemptions to plans to tighten public access to the database, Secretary for Financial Services Christopher Hui said on Saturday.
Business and governance experts have criticised a government plan to restrict access to the personal information of company directors, outlined this year, saying it will reduce transparency in the city's corporate sector.
Dealmakers working through the due diligence phase of corporate transactions regularly consult the database to research and verify the history and identities of executives and directors.
Hui told a RTHK Radio programme on Saturday that lawyers, bankers and accountants could now apply to the company registry to gain access to documents for work purposes.
""But the premise is that they have to be really doing relevant checks and work, because we need to strike a balance and protect privacy,"" Hui was quoted as saying on the RTHK website.
""For example, lawyers, accountants and banks have to be doing the searches for know-your-customer checks or work related to compliance and anti money-laundering.""
The proposed exemptions were confirmed to Reuters by Hui’s spokeswoman.
Changes to the registry announced earlier included a first phase which gave companies an immediate option to withhold information about directors, such as their addresses and identification or passport numbers. 
A second phase would withhold all documents containing such information from public view.

The Hong Kong government had argued the reforms were needed to protect privacy.
Information on the data base is also commonly used to trace cross-party and cross-company ownership structures that feature in Hong Kong’s sometimes opaque corporate system.

(Reuters) -Apple Inc on Friday said it has tightened some of its rules for responding to legal requests after the U.S. Justice Department during Donald Trump's presidency subpoenaed it for information on Democratic lawmakers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it recently instituted a limit of 25 identifiers such as email addresses or phone numbers per legal request.
The Cupertino, California-based company said it received a subpoena from the Justice Department in February 2018 for information on 109 identifiers made up of 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, but that it did not release content such as emails and pictures to prosecutors.
The New York Times on Thursday reported that federal prosecutors subpoenaed Apple and other companies as part of an investigation searching for the sources behind news media reports about contacts between Trump's associates and Russia. 
The investigation targeted at least two Democrats on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, aides and family members, including one minor, the Times reported. 
Apple said that it had no way to tell what the nature of the investigation was and released only basic ""account subscriber information"" such as names, addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers, as well as connection logs and IP addresses.

Apple said that it did not provide data showing to whom or when messages of any kind were sent.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food & Drug Administration on Friday said Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) must throw away millions of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine that were manufactured at a problem-plagued Baltimore factory but also cleared millions for use.
Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that the agency had cleared about 10 million doses. The New York Times said that the batches being discarded amount to around 60 million doses, citing people familiar with the matter.
Without disclosing or confirming the number of vaccine doses, the FDA said in a news release that it had authorized two batches of the vaccine for use, that several other batches were not suitable for use and that others were being evaluated. 
The agency said it was not yet ready to authorize Emergent BioSolutions Inc's plant for manufacturing the J&J vaccine. Production of J&J's vaccine at the Baltimore site was halted by U.S. authorities in April and J&J was put in charge of manufacturing at the plant.
One source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the J&J doses are expected to be exported to other countries. The doses are already in vials and ready for use, the other source said.
Safety concerns about the J&J vaccine paired with flagging U.S. demand for vaccinations in general have slowed rollout of the one-shot vaccine to a crawl. Close to half of the 21 million doses produced for the United States sit unused.
The FDA said its decision allows for the J&J doses to be used in the United States or exported. The agency said the drugmaker and Emergent must agree that the FDA can share relevant information about the manufacturing of the doses with regulators where the vaccine is shipped.
J&J, in a statement, confirmed that the FDA authorized the two batches, but did not acknowledge the doses regulators decided should be tossed. 
""Today's decisions represent progress in our continued efforts to make a difference in this pandemic on a global scale,"" Kathy Wengel, J&J's chief global supply chain officer, said in the statement.
The FDA declined to comment beyond its statement.
Last month, Emergent Chief Executive Robert Kramer said it was his understanding that there are 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine ready for FDA review and that regulators had begun the review process.
The April halt followed the discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine. AstraZeneca's shot is no longer being made there.
An FDA inspection also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices at the Emergent plant. 
Separately, Europe's drug regulator said on Friday that batches of J&J COVID-19 vaccine made for the region around the time the contamination issues were revealed at the Baltimore plant would, as a precaution, not be used.
The European Medicines Agency did not say how many shots were affected, but Reuters has reported it involves millions of doses, making it harder for J&J to meet a target of delivering 55 million to Europe by end of June. 

Later on Friday, Canada's drug regulator said it would not release J&J's shipment of 300,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses, which were made at the Baltimore plant.
Health Canada said it was planning an onsite inspection this summer and that it would not accept any product or ingredients made at the plant until the inspection was complete.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed modestly higher at the end of a torpid week marked with few market-moving catalysts and persistent concerns over whether current inflation spikes could linger and cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten its dovish policy sooner than expected.
The Nasdaq gained the most among the three major indexes, while the bellwether S&P 500 squeaked its way to a second straight record closing high.
For the week, the S&P and the Nasdaq advanced from last Friday's close, while the Dow posted a small weekly loss.
The indexes have been range-bound, with few catalysts to move investor sentiment. Much of the focus centered on Thursday's consumer price data, which eased jitters over the duration of the current inflation wave.
""It’s a muted day today,"" Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""The summer is settling in, people are slipping out of work early and there’s nothing in the news that’s going to materially drive the market in either direction."" 
""So, investors are going to wait until earnings season.""
The Federal Reserve has repeatedly said that near-term price surges will not metastasize into lasting inflation, an assertion reflected in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment report released on Friday, which showed inflation expectations easing from last month's spike.
Investors now turn their attention to the Fed's statement at the conclusion of next week's two-day monetary policy meeting, which will be parsed for clues regarding the central bank's timetable for raising key interest rates. 
""Our view continues to be that inflationary data is transient and we will be around the 2% mark for the year,"" Pursche added.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields posted their biggest weekly drop in nearly a year, weighing on the interest-sensitive financial sector in recent sessions.
The Food and Drug Administration is facing mounting criticism over its ""accelerated approval"" of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm without strong evidence of its ability to combat the disease.
Biogen shares ended down 4.4%, while the broader healthcare sector shed 0.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.36 points, or 0.04%, to 34,479.6, the S&P 500 gained 8.26 points, or 0.19%, to 4,247.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 49.09 points, or 0.35%, to 14,069.42.
Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, rebounding financial stocks and tech led the gainers, while healthcare suffered the biggest percentage drop.
Much of the trading volume this week was attributable to the ongoing social media-driven ""meme stock"" phenomenon, in which retail investors swarm around heavily shorted stocks.
But meme stock moves were more muted on Friday, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) outperformed, gaining 15.4%. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 108 new highs and 16 new lows.

So, let’s examine these companies more closely.Cancer is one of the most researched diseases globally, with innumerable research companies with extensive drug pipelines developing treatments and therapies for the disease. Nearly 2 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year, and more than 600,000 of those cases are expected to be fatal.
Thus, biotech companies are under pressure to develop effective drugs to combat the disease. They have been conducting multiple clinical trials to extend cancer patients’ survival rates and duration of response and are adopting advanced technologies in immunotherapies to capitalize on the heightened need for cancer treatments. The global interventional oncology market is expected to grow at a 6.8% CAGR over the next five years to hit $2.9 billion by 2026. In fact, positive results from clinical trials reported by multiple biotech companies have boosted investor optimism regarding the growth potential of this industry.

(Reuters) - A third member of a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has resigned in protest over the agency's decision to approve Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's disease treatment despite the committee's recommendation against doing so.
Aaron Kesselheim, a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School who had served on the FDA’s advisory committee for nervous system drugs since 2015, told Reuters on Thursday he was stepping down from the panel. 
""My rationale was that the FDA needs to re-evaluate how it solicits and uses the advisory committees ... because I didn’t think that the firm recommendations from the committee in this case ... were appropriately integrated into the decision-making process,"" Kesselheim said in an email. 
He cited FDA's decision to approve Sarepta Therapeutic Inc's drug, eteplirsen, for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2016 as another example of the regulator approving a drug against the recommendations of its advisory committee. 
Stat News first reported his departure. 
On Tuesday, a member of the advisory group who voted against the approval, Washington University neurologist Dr. Joel Perlmutter, resigned from the committee, citing the FDA's approval of Aduhelm.
Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman said he resigned on Wednesday.

The 11-member committee voted nearly unanimously in November that Biogen's drug should not be approved, citing inconclusive evidence that the drug was effective. 
The FDA on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY) gave the drug ""accelerated approval,” based on evidence that it can reduce a likely contributor to Alzheimer’s, rather than proof of a clear benefit against the disease.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 05:21PM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. FDA faces mounting criticism over Alzheimer's drug approval,"By Deena Beasley and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - In approving the first new Alzheimer's drug in nearly 20 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is taking its biggest risk yet with a strategy that allows new therapies onto the market without strong evidence that they work, regulatory and scientific experts say. 
The Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) drug, Aduhelm, was authorized based on evidence that it can reduce brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's, rather than proof that it slows progression of the lethal mind-wasting disease. 
The FDA has granted so-called ""accelerated approval"" in more than 250 instances since 1992, mainly for rare diseases or small patient populations that have had no effective treatments available to them. In these cases, the agency requires that drugmakers conduct additional clinical trials to prove their therapy works, or face withdrawal from the market. 
Aduhelm, however, is in a different league in terms of the number of potential patients and cost to the healthcare system. 
In addition, the FDA approval ignored the recommendation of its outside advisors, who said Biogen did not provide enough evidence of clinical benefit. Three of the advisory panel's members have resigned in protest since the FDA decision was announced on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY). 
""This decision has shaken the foundations of the scientific process and methods,"" said Dr. Jason Karlawish, co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia. Karlawish ran one of the trial sites for the Biogen drug. 
He said the FDA made its decision ""by fiat,"" and had not asked its advisors to consider whether the drug's ability to remove a type of brain plaques known as beta amyloid would improve outcomes for patients. 
""It's a disturbing set of events, scientifically, clinically, politically,"" Karlawish said. 
Biogen has said that some 1.5 million Americans with early-stage Alzheimer's will be eligible for the drug, priced at an average of $56,000 per year, with the federal Medicare insurance program for seniors likely on the hook for most of the cost. 
The FDA approval allows Biogen to sell its product over several years - with forecasts for potential annual sales reaching as high $10 billion to $50 billion - until the company completes a required follow-up study. 
""No amount of unmet need can take the place of sufficient evidence,"" said Johns Hopkins public health professor Dr. Caleb Alexander, a member of the FDA advisory panel.
The number of Americans living with Alzheimer's is expected to more than double to around 13 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
Biogen research chief Alfred Sandrock said the FDA had painstakingly analyzed its clinical trial data over two years before reaching a conclusion.
""I believe they came to the right decision on behalf of the American public,"" Sandrock said in an interview. 
A VIEW FROM THE FDA 
The FDA has defended its decision by saying that Biogen presented clear evidence that Aduhelm, known chemically as aducanumab, removed beta amyloid from the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.
Amyloid has long been a target of experimental therapies for the disease. However, none of the earlier drugs have shown that reductions in amyloid resulted in significant benefits for patients by slowing deteriorating cognition or ability to function. 
Dr. Peter Stein, director of the FDA's Office of New Drugs, told Reuters that Aduhelm showed the clearest correlation so far between a reduction in beta amyloid and a delay in cognitive decline among patients, suggesting it was a good predictor of clinical benefit. 
FDA officials said other Alzheimer's drug developers cannot assume their therapies will be considered under the same framework. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co and Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) are among drugmakers also working on amyloid-targeting medicines.
""We can't say right now whether this will be a path for other Alzheimer's drugs, or drugs for other neurodegenerative diseases,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told Reuters.
Critics are less convinced that amyloid removal is an adequate proxy to predict benefit. 
""We need to rethink the use of these regulations as interpreted and used by FDA,"" said Karlawish.
Nearly half of all drugs receiving accelerated approval ultimately got full approval, after a median of around three years, according to a report by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a drug cost watchdog.
Exceptions include Lilly's Lartruvo for sarcoma, which was withdrawn, while the FDA revoked its authorization for Roche's Avastin to treat breast cancer, although it is still used for other cancers.
More than 100 drugs with accelerated approvals have been on the market a median of just under two years, according to ICER. The report noted that many of the confirmatory trials are slow to complete, and the results often ambiguous. 
""The agency has gotten comfortable with the accelerated approval pathway,"" said attorney Jim Shehan, head of FDA regulatory practice at law firm Lowenstein Sandler. 
Biogen has said a confirmatory Aduhelm trial could take nine years to complete. The FDA described that estimate as “conservative” and said it would support “efforts to complete this trial in the shortest possible timeline.” 

Despite Aduhelm's high price, patient advocates hailed the FDA decision, saying it will revive research in the field, including the kinds of drug combinations that have improved treatment of complex diseases like cancer and HIV. 
""This approval will spark additional investment by other companies in disease-modifying treatments and therapies,"" advocacy group UsAgainstAlzheimer's said in a statement.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 04:57PM ET</span>",Stocks set record highs as bond yields slide,"By Herbert Lash and Tom Wilson
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -European shares, the S&P 500 and an index of global stock performance scaled new peaks while yields on U.S., Japanese and European government debt fell on Friday as investors embraced the easy monetary policies of major central banks.
Investor sentiment rose in Europe after the European Central Bank raised its growth and inflation projections on Thursday, and also renewed a pledge to keep stimulus flowing.
The pan-regional STOXX Europe 600 index rose 0.7% to a record close, posting its sixth straight session of gains and best weekly performance at 1.1% since early May.
The MSCI all-country world equity index, a benchmark that tracks shares in 50 countries, set a new intraday high and record close at 719.52, up 0.2% in a late-day surge that also lifted the S&P 500 to an all-time close.
Stocks on Wall Street seesawed most of the session near breakeven as investors bought tech stocks after shrugging off data on Thursday that showed year-on-year inflation spiked to 5.0% in May, a jump the Federal Reserve has said is transient.
Declining Treasury yields have confounded investors who see signs of inflation being more persistent than the Fed's view that sharply rising consumer prices will be short-lived.
""You've seen an increasing comfort level with the Fed's stance that inflation is going to be transitory, and as that sinks in, you continue to see large buyers of bonds, which is keeping yields from rising,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Inflation data has alarmed many investors, but for the moment the reaction is stocks are still preferable to bonds in an inflationary environment, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""There is a concern that eventually you could get some migration out of stocks into bonds,"" Meckler added. ""But right now we seem to be at that pre-tipping point where bonds don't yield enough to scare people out of stocks.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.04%, the S&P 500 gained 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.35%.
U.S. growth-oriented stocks slightly outpaced value stocks as the two styles vied for leadership: big tech stocks added the most upside followed by financial shares.
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management, said he is concerned about the long-term outlook for equities because of stretched valuations once interest rates start to rise, perhaps starting in late in 2022.
""Value-oriented cyclical companies with good quality balance sheet are probably the best deal in this kind of market,"" Ablin said.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%. 
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes slid 0.5 basis points to 1.4535% after earlier declines that positioned the benchmark for its biggest weekly decline in a year.
Euro area bond yields followed Treasuries. Benchmark German 10-year bonds fell 3 basis points to -0.28% and were set for their best week of the year. Yields move inversely with prices. 
Falling expectations that higher inflation could lead to early Fed tightening prompted a flattening of the U.S. yield curve, with the spread between the 10-year and 2-year yield at its narrowest since late February on Friday. 
Yields will likely move higher again as economies reopen from COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. 
""We still think consumers are going to help prices higher, when these economies reopen properly, that people can start traveling again, spending again,"" said Jeremy Gatto, investment manager at Unigestion. ""We are going to get a further boost from the consumption side, and we therefore expect bond yields to move higher."" 
The euro and sterling dipped against the dollar as investors bet interest rates would stay lower for longer in Europe.
The dollar index rose 0.49%, with the euro down 0.51% to $1.2107. The Japanese yen weakened 0.31% versus the greenback at 109.66 per dollar.
Oil prices rose to multi-year highs, heading for a third straight week of gains on the improved outlook for worldwide demand as rising vaccination rates lead to a lifting of pandemic curbs.

Brent crude futures rose 17 cents to settle at $72.69 a barrel. U.S. crude futures settled up 62 cents at $70.91 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% lower at $1,879.6 an ounce.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators urge financial firms to quickly ditch Libor rate benchmarks,"By Pete Schroeder and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. financial regulators urged market participants on Friday to accelerate their efforts to detach financial products from Libor interest rate benchmarks, while casting doubt on new benchmarks built to compete with their preferred replacement.
Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles emphasized there is ""no path forward"" for Libor, which is being scrapped after numerous banks were fined for manipulating it, and that firms have no reason to delay moving derivatives and other market contracts to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate.
""The deniers and laggards are engaging in magical thinking,"" Quarles said during a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a regulatory panel. ""Libor is over.""
A host of senior U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, echoed that message, as regulators worry that financial firms are moving away too slowly from the previous benchmark, which is set to expire at the end of this year for new contracts.
Yellen said some sectors, including business loans, are ""well behind"" where they should be in the transition. Regulators have struggled for months to convince market participants to abandon Libor, and have relied on increasingly severe rhetoric to convince them that the benchmark will no longer be an option in the near future.
At the same time, regulators had harsh words for competing benchmarks, like the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY). They warned that, like Libor, those benchmarks are built on relatively few transactions, which could make them unreliable or subject to manipulation.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said BSBY is built around less than $10 billion in transactions per day when it is meant to serve as a foundation for trillions of dollars in transactions.
""When a benchmark is mismatched like that, there’s a heck of an economic incentive to manipulate it,"" he warned.

As a result, Wall Street analysts expect the stocks of popular Chinese companies JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Tencent Music (TME), and HUYA (HUYA) to advance in the coming months. Read on, let’s take a closer look at these names.China was the only major economy to report a GDP growth last year, at a time when most economies were grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has maintained its growth trajectory this year, with record GDP growth of 18.3% in the first quarter versus the same period last year. In fact, China’s GDP growth in the last quarter has been its fastest since 1992.
China has been taking active steps to curb inflation in the country, which soared to multi-year highs in the last quarter. Its Central Bank Governor Yi Gang expects consumer prices to fall in the coming months because the country is taking steps to rein in commodity prices through targeted measures aimed at restricting “abnormal prices” and “malicious speculation,” as well as preventing hoarding and/or speculative trades in the industrial sector.
So, the Chinese economy is expected to generate sustainable growth in 2021. This should drive the performance of established companies JD.com, Inc. (JD),  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), and HUYA Inc. (HUYA). Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to rally more than 35% over the next 12 months.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at another record Friday, as a late show of investor appetite for stocks rounded off a week in which a hotter inflation report was largely cast aside ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.19% to end the day at a closing high of 4,247. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.04%, or 13 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.35%.
Wall Street was sluggish after making a bright start to the session, though the marching feet of the bulls returned leading up to the closing bell. 
Investors were keen on keeping their powder dry ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting ending Wednesday as bets on surprising from the central bank are few and far between. The backdrop of mixed economic data will help the central bank leaned into its view of an uneven recovery that still requires support. 
The labor market isn't making the job gains many had expected, while inflation has surprised to the upside, though is widely assumed to be transitory.
""Since the last meeting, economic data have delivered more questions and answers. In light of the uncertainty, it's hard to imagine any changes in the Fed's messaging,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report.
While Fed members have recently shown an appetite to begin the talk on tapering, Chairman Jerome Powell isn’t expected to give much away.
""Powell will no doubt be asked about any tapering discussions in light of the April FOMC minutes. We expect him to echo Clarida and Quarles and say that is might be appropriate to start talking about it in the next few meetings, but the Committee is not there yet,"" Jefferies added.
This backdrop of humdrum has been captured in recent market moves amid a lack of conviction from traders to make meaningful bets in either direction.

In a June 2 application, the coffee chain sought approval to use its name in ""providing stadium and training facilities for sports and entertainment activities"" and ""promoting business, sports and entertainment events of others.""
Approval could enable Seattle-based Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to join companies such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Canadian Tire, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), PPG Paints,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Toyota and United Airlines whose names already adorn professional stadiums and arenas.

Starbucks declined to comment.
Naming rights agreements often run for decades and can cost several or tens of millions of dollars annually.

(Reuters) -  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp will push ahead with a return to cruises this summer despite two guests onboard a test run for Royal Caribbean's Celebrity Millennium ship testing positive for COVID-19.
A year after several cruise ships were host to major coronavirus outbreaks and with large numbers of Americans now vaccinated, cruise lines have been striving to get business going.
Shares in Royal Caribbean, Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd, which all booked massive losses last year as restrictions brought the industry to a standstill, fell between 1% and 2% in response to the positive tests.
Royal Caribbean declined to give more details on the guests who had tested positive or the circumstances of their infection, when asked by Reuters on Friday.
Celebrity Cruises later said it was paying to fly both guests home privately on Saturday and planning to disembark the remaining passengers on time after being tested.
A source close to Carnival who declined to be named, said the company was also pressing ahead with its summer cruises as planned.
The Celebrity Millennium cruise is due to end on the island of St. Maarten on Saturday.
All guests on board were required to show proof of vaccination as well as a negative COVID-19 test before sailing from St. Maarten a week ago.
The operator, one of the first in North America to restart operations on a trial basis, said on Thursday the individuals were asymptomatic, in isolation and being monitored by medics. Celebrity was also conducting contact tracing and expediting testing for all close contacts, it added.
Cruise industry blogger Ashley Kosciolek wrote https://cruise.blog/2021/06/live-celebrity-millennium-third-party-excursion-and-night-quarantine in her live blog that she was told on Thursday evening that the infected passengers had been on her onshore excursion on Barbados two days earlier. She was asked to stay in her room for about four hours, until her results showed negative.
Kosciolek's posts showed the cruise had also stopped in Aruba and Curacao.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was not possible for cruising to be a zero-risk activity as it will always pose some risk of transmission, adding that it was committed to ensure that cruise ship operations were conducted in a safe manner.

Cruise lines are in discussions with Florida, from where some ships will sail, after the state's governor pushed against people having to show proof of vaccine. Trips are scheduled to start in June and early July, sailing to the Caribbean, Mexican Riviera and Alaska.
Cruise expert Stewart Chiron, who is on board the Celebrity Millennium ship, told Reuters that life onboard on Thursday night had gone on as planned, with dinners, shows, and evening entertainment. He said no one on board was wearing masks.

HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp has lost two veteran crude oil traders from its U.S. energy trading group and a third is leaving its British unit, according to people familiar with the matter, in a continued exodus of top talent from the oil major. 
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) last year reversed course on an expansion of its oil and petroleum products trading as fuel demand tumbled during the pandemic. The company suffered a $22.4 billion loss in 2020, leading to deep job and cost cuts across the business. 
Veteran oil traders Michael Paradise and Adam Buller, both of whom joined Exxon in 2019 after lengthy careers elsewhere, resigned last week, the people said. Paul Butcher, an oil trader in Britain, plans to leave in September, another person familiar with the operation said. 
Butcher was recruited in 2018 as a North Sea crude oil trader and adviser on accounting for transactions to its Leatherhead unit near London. He had previously worked for BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc and Vitol SA. 
Exxon declined to comment on the departures, citing personnel matters. 
""We’re pleased with our progress over the past couple of years to grow our team and capabilities,"" said spokesman Casey Norton. Exxon's scale and reach ""give our trading teams a broad footprint and unique knowledge and insights"" that can generate value for shareholders. 
VETERAN DEPARTURES 
Paradise was a highly regarded crude oil trader who joined Exxon from Noble Group and was previously director of crude oil trading at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). Buller joined Exxon in late 2019 after trading oil for Petrolama Energy Canada and Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) SA. He earlier was director of international oil trading at BG Group. 
Both will join Pilot Flying J, a closely-held Knoxville, Tennessee, company that operates retail refueling centers in North America. It has expanded into crude marketing, fuel transportation and storage and has is own trading unit run by a former Noble Group executive.
A spokesperson at Pilot Flying J declined to comment. 
Exxon recruited Paradise, Buller and a cadre of experienced traders from rivals and international oil trading firms hoping to replicate BP and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s success in trading. It initially saw the expansion as a way to profit from its knowledge of customer demand, oil production, pipelines and fuel shipping. 
BP and Shell's trading groups took advantage of last year's market volatility to generate enormous trading profits, buying oil as it fell below $20 a barrel last spring. They sold it at higher prices for future delivery, posting multibillion-dollar profits for the year.
But Exxon pulled back trading as the market dropped and sought to preserve its capital to sustain its shareholder dividend while rivals cut their payouts. 

Exxon systematically avoided risk by pulling most of the capital needed for speculative trades, subjecting most trades to high-level management review, and limiting some traders to working only with longtime Exxon customers. 
It later laid off some staff and offered early retirement packages to others, Reuters reported. Exxon does not separately report the performance of its trading unit.

The fate of U.S. airline workers has shifted dramatically in the three months since the industry won a third payroll support package in March. As more Americans receive COVID-19 vaccines, travel demand has surged, driving the need for more workers.
John Slater, United's senior vice president of inflight services, cited an ""increase in customer demand and our current outlook for the future"" in his memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.
""This announcement makes it clear: the Payroll Support Program (PSP) worked,"" said Sara Nelson, president of AFA International representing nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines including United.
U.S. airlines received a total of $54 billion in payroll aid which protected workers' jobs and salaries even as they sat on the sidelines due to reduced flight schedules during the pandemic.
As vaccination rates climb, airlines are adding flights, bringing back workers, and in some cases planning to hire again.

United is adding more than 480 daily flights back to its schedule this month alone.
""Given the current outlook for the future of United, we continue to move closer to full frontline staffing levels to support our operation,"" a United spokesperson said.

Consequently, we think two major players in the shipping industry—Castor Maritime (CTRM) and Costamare (NYSE:CMRE)—are expected to benefit in the coming months. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) and  Costamare Inc . (CMRE) are two established players in the shipping industry. Based in Limassol, Cyprus, CTRM provides seaborne transportation services for dry bulk cargo, including iron ore, coal, grains, and steel products. CMRE is an international owner of containerships. The Monaco-based company provides marine transportation services worldwide by chartering its container vessels to liner operators under long-, medium-, and short-term time charters.
Most shipping companies were hit severely by the COVID-19 pandemic as travel-related restrictions and a decline in international trade brought the industry to a near halt. However, as major economies across the globe resume manufacturing and infrastructure activities, the demand for commodities such as iron ore and coal—which are transported primarily by sea—is increasing. With continued progress on the coronavirus vaccination front worldwide and reduced COVID-19 cases, this trend is expected to continue. According to Globe Newswire, the global dry bulk shipping market is expected to grow at a 5.10% CAGR between 2020 - 2027.Both CMRE and CTRM should witness increasing demand for their services as a result. 
While CMRE has gained 123.2% over the past nine months, CTRM has returned 122.2%. However, in terms of their past six months’ performance, CTRM is a clear winner with 97.1% returns versus CMRE’s 49.9%. But which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Four Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp directors called on Friday for a shake-up of its management and board, in a sign of revolt after an investigation found the conglomerate colluded with the Japanese government to ""beat up"" foreign shareholders.
The very public push-back by the independent directors, all non-Japanese, is the latest twist in a scandal that shows how the old guard of Japan Inc, while still powerful, can no longer exert full control over shareholders. 
It comes a day after an explosive, shareholder-commissioned investigation revealed - in startling detail rare for such probes in corporate Japan - how management reached out to the powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to strong-arm activist investors.
The investigation ""made clear"" that some members of Toshiba's management and board took actions that ""were unacceptable and directly against the interests of our shareholders"", the four directors, Jerome Black, Paul Brough, Ayako Weissman and George Zage, said in a statement.
Both board and management changes were needed, they said, calling some parts of the report ""deeply disturbing"".
Toshiba declined to comment. It has yet to comment on the report itself.
The investigators detailed one email among top Toshiba managers about the company's largest shareholder, Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management. In that incident, one executive allegedly said: ""We will ask METI to beat them up for a while.""
The report, released on Thursday, said that Yoshihide Suga - then chief cabinet secretary and now prime minister - verbally encouraged the pressure on investors during a meeting with a senior Toshiba executive last year, an allegation Suga has denied.
""If we are aggressive, we can get them"" with foreign ownership rules, Suga allegedly told the executive, referring to rules introduced in 2020 and designed to protect industries critical to Japan's national security.
Toshiba is of strategic importance to Tokyo as a maker of nuclear reactors and defence equipment. 
CRITICAL TURN
The probe's findings mark a critical turn in a long battle between the company's management and foreign shareholders, which include Effissimo, another Singapore-based fund, 3D Investment Partners, and Harvard University's endowment fund.
Japan's trade minister on Friday denied his officials directed an adviser to lean on Toshiba's foreign shareholders to ensure management won a key vote on board membership last year.
The investigators' report said Toshiba, working in unison with the trade ministry, ""effectively asked"" a government adviser, described as ""Mr. M"", to negotiate with Harvard University's endowment fund to change its voting behaviour.
""Ministry officials have informed me that it's not true that any request was made to engage with individual investors,"" Trade Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama told reporters. He added that the ministry was waiting on Toshiba's response to the report.
Sources previously told Reuters https://jp.reuters.com/article/toshiba-board-idCNL1N2J4052 that Hiromichi Mizuno, a ministry adviser at the time, had told the Harvard fund it could be subject to a regulatory probe if it did not follow management's recommendations at last year's annual general meeting. The fund subsequently abstained from voting.
Mizuno, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc board member who previously oversaw Japan's $1.4 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund, is currently the U.N. Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investment.
He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
DEATH KNELL FOR OLD JAPAN
Some activist investors said, however, that the successful push by shareholders for the independent investigation in a landmark vote this year and the report's findings showed progress was being made in Japan corporate governance.
""It's a direct result of Japan trying to really have a world class governance structure. It doesn't mean they're perfect yet,"" said Brian Heywood, CEO of Taiyo Pacific Partners, an activist fund that has operated in Japan for 20 years.
""All of Japan Inc isn’t rushing to Toshiba's defence,"" he said, adding that he saw the debacle as a ""last gasp"" of Japan's trade-ministry controlled capitalism.
U.S. proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Friday urged shareholders at this year's AGM to vote against the re-appointment of Toshiba board chairman Osamu Nagayama and four others nominated to the board by the company.
As one of the industrial conglomerates that modernized Japan and helped its post-World War Two economic recovery, Toshiba enjoys close ties with the government. Its nuclear reactors and defence equipment businesses mean it is also closely monitored by industry bureaucrats.
In 2017, however, battered by accounting scandals and massive writedowns on its U.S. nuclear reactor business, Toshiba had to quickly seek a large capital injection from overseas investors. As a result, activist investors are estimated to account for 25% of Toshiba's shareholder base. 
Since the push by activist shareholders this year for greater accountability, Toshiba has faced a $20 billion bid from CVC Capital and seen former CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani resign in the ensuing turmoil.
While Toshiba has dismissed that bid, it has announced it will conduct a strategic review.

""Given Toshiba's complete failure of governance and lack of transparency shown by the independent report, we believe radical reform through going private is the only viable option to rejuvenate the company,"" said an executive at a large Toshiba shareholder, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Toshiba's shares closed down 1.6% on Friday compared with a flat broader market.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 02:02PM ET</span>","Analysis: Remittance firms slow to add bitcoin, despite El Salvador move","By Tom Arnold and Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - El Salvador may be touting bitcoin's use to help its citizens living abroad send funds back home, but the biggest remittance firms are cautious about offering cryptocurrency services.
In a move that could be a harbinger of crypto becoming a more popular way to send money across borders, El Salvador on Wednesday became the first country to adopt bitcoin as a parallel legal tender.
President Nayib Bukele played up bitcoin's potential as a remittance currency for Salvadorans overseas.
But despite the possible long-term risk to their business if such moves escalate, only a few of the traditional remittance companies who send the bulk of cross-border transfers are dabbling.
Any efforts to get into crypto could be a double-edged sword, pushing down the fees that form the bedrock of their business.
""For  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) and some of the other remittance providers keep in mind that most of the volume in the remittance industry is going from developed markets to emerging markets primarily to people -families and friends - that operate in cash,"" said Kenneth Suchoski, U.S payments and fintech analyst at Autonomous Research.
""To the extent that bitcoin isn't adopted and there's not widespread acceptance, these remittance providers are still going to be relevant for the years to come,"" he added.
Less than 1% of the volume of global cross-border remittances are currently in crypto, estimated Suchoski. But in the future crypto is expected to account for a larger slice of the more than $500 billion in global annual remittances. 
Yet bitcoin offers, in theory, a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional remittance channels.
An early mover among remittance firms, MoneyGram International said last month it will allow customers to buy and sell bitcoin for cash at 12,000 U.S. retail locations under a partnership with Coinme, the U.S.'s largest licensed crypto cash exchange.
""We've built a bridge to connect bitcoin and other digital currencies to local fiat currency,"" MoneyGram said in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""As crypto and digital currencies rise in prominence, a core barrier to further growth is the on/off ramps to local fiat currencies.""
Western Union, the largest remittance business, had tested using bitcoin and crypto in the past and hadn't come up with a good ""use case"" that involved significant cost savings, said Suchoski.
Western Union and other large players, including Wise, WorldRemit, Remitly, Xoom and Ria Money Transfer did not respond to requests for comment.
CRYPTO CRIME 
The remittance industry has successfully made the evolution from transfers via physical retail outlets to online in recent years, a trend hastened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cross-border remittances via mobile money rose by 65% in 2020 to $12 billion.
But any transition from digital to crypto may prove more challenging.
""I really have a hard time seeing how they're gonna compete, unless they really slash their price - you can't compete for free,"" Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto platform Paxful, which is popular in Africa and seeks to compete with traditional remittance firms.
Remittance firms are already under pressure to cut fees, which averaged 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to a World Bank report, more than double the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal's 2030 target for remittance fees.
In contrast, bitcoin transfer fees in Nigeria, for example, would typically total about 2%-2.5%.
Increasing regulatory costs related to efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing are another burden for traditional remittance firms.
Western Union's annual compliance costs had risen closer to $200 million from around $100 million a decade or so ago, said Suchoski.
Bitcoin would likely add to that burden.

Bitcoin's potential for anonymous transactions has long worried regulators, who fear it can facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing. Many crypto companies have boosted compliance steps, such as requesting user ID, but this is a costly process.
""Bitcoin has been used in a lot of underground transactions,"" Suchoski said.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 01:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lithium Americas delays Nevada mine work after environmentalist lawsuit,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp has delayed plans to excavate its Thacker Pass lithium mine site in Nevada, according to court filings, while a federal judge considers whether the former Trump administration erred in approving the project that opponents say could threaten sage grouse and other wildlife. 
The delay is the latest setback for the U.S. critical minerals industry as environmentalists pressure courts and regulators to block mining projects from a slew of companies including ioneer Ltd ,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc , Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and others, even if those mines produce metals key to fighting climate change. 
Thacker Pass, if completed, would be the largest lithium mine in the United States, producing 30,000 tonnes of lithium annually - enough to make more than 475,000 electric vehicle (EV) batteries. 
The court case, though, is likely to push back the company's development timeline and an adverse ruling could seriously imperil it.
Mine opponents have asked a federal judge to rule by next month on whether Vancouver-based Lithium Americas may dig at the northern Nevada site.
The company had intended to start digging at the site on June 23, several months earlier than initially planned.
Opponents requested a temporary injunction to block excavation while the court considers the broader case, which centers on whether the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) erred in approving the project in January less than a week before U.S. President Donald Trump left office. 
Thacker Pass has been under review for more than a decade.
Lithium Americas this week agreed to pause digging through late July, according to filings. 
SAGE GROUSE
Environmentalists filed the suit after that BLM decision, arguing in part that regulators did not abide by federal statues designed to protect sage grouse. The company and BLM disagree, according to filings. 
""These sage grouse protections are the law of the land and we feel we have a strong case with our injunction motion,"" Roger Flynn, an attorney representing conservation groups, told Reuters.
Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, who is overseeing the case, has in the past ruled in favor of preserving sage grouse habitats.
If Du grants the injunction, Lithium Americas would not be able to develop the site while she considers the broader question of whether the Trump administration erred in approving the mine. A ruling on that is expected later this year or in 2022. 
In a statement, Lithium Americas said it is ""confident the BLM's extensive and approved environmental impact statement will withstand judicial scrutiny.""
Lithium Americas told the court that blocking the mine would harm national security and impede President Joe Biden's plan to wean the U.S. economy off fossil fuels.
Reuters reported last month that Biden plans to look abroad for most supplies of EV metals, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists.
Lithium Americas has an unlikely ally in Glenn Miller, who founded the environmental group Great Basin Resource Watch, which is one of the conservationist groups suing to block the mine. 

Miller said he disagrees with the group's opposition to the project and resigned from its board earlier this week.
""Everyone is deeply concerned about climate change. It's a question about values, and I go with the need for lithium,"" said Miller, a retired professor at the University of Nevada. ""This is one of the least-impactive mine plans I've ever seen.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's main autopart association INA forecasts that the severe semiconductor chip shortage that has slammed the brakes on the global auto industry will subside in July and return to normal by the end of this year. 
Semiconductor chips are a crucial component for electronics in modern cars, including touchscreen displays as well as driver assist and other safety systems. 
The chip shortage in North America alone has caused the region's carmakers to cut previously expected output by 1.16 million vehicles in May, a figure that has accelerated each month since the start of the year, according to data from IHS Markit.
INA's head of foreign trade, Alberto Bustamante, forecast in an interview on Thursday that the semiconductor shortage will begin to ease by the second half of July before returning to normal in December.
The supply crunch began last year as the coronavirus pandemic forced the North American auto industry to shut down for a couple of months, which kicked off a cascading series of order cancellations.
Bustamante pointed to steadily growing vaccination rates in major economies and ebbing infections as helping drive a return to normal for the auto sector.
He noted that after Mexico's autoparts output dropped 20% last year in value terms due to the pandemic, a nearly 18% uptick is expected this year to reach $92.4 billion in production value. A full recovery to pre-pandemic levels is forecast by 2022.
Mexico's massive auto sector is the country's top foreign currency earner, and employs more than 850,000 people.

Bustamente predicted that by 2023, the value of the country's autopart production will likely exceed $102 billion, fueled by a revamped North American trade pact that incentivizes more regionally-produced content, among other factors.
Every vehicle assembled in the United States includes up to $5,500 in Mexican-made parts, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google would not be able to eliminate user-tracking technology that is important to advertisers from its Chrome browser without sign-off from Britain's competition regulator under a proposal released on Friday.
The company said it had welcomed the opportunity to work with the regulator on its initiative to reconcile privacy and competition concerns. 
The Competition and Markets Authority in January began reviewing Google's plan to cut support for some cookies in Chrome as early as next year.
Companies in the $250 billion global online display advertising industry had expressed concern that the loss of cookies in the world's most popular browser would harm their ability to collect information for personalising ads and make them ever more reliant on Google's user databases.
In a series of commitments the CMA announced on Friday, which are subject to public comment until July 8 before becoming final, Google would involve the regulator closely in a project, known as Privacy Sandbox, to develop alternative tracking technologies. 
Google has said that users increasingly expect the web to be more private. But some advertising cookies have allowed consumers' web browsing to be tracked in ways that concern some of them.
While Google last year said its potential alternatives to cookies would better protect users' privacy, British investigators found they also would ""distort competition"" in online ads and ""allow Google to exploit its apparent dominant position"".
One of the potential replacements, known as FLoC, is being tested among 0.5% of Chrome users and the CMA pointed to ways it could give Google an edge over rivals.
Google said it would work to ensure that whatever emerges from Privacy Sandbox does not leave it with an unfair advantage. 
CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said the regulator was ""taking a leading role"" in setting out how it could work with powerful tech companies to shape their behaviour and protect competition.

Tim Cowen, chair of the antitrust practice at law firm Preiskel & Co and a Google critic, told Reuters Google has a track record of toothless commitments, citing as an example ones given recently to French competition authorities. 
""If the CMA is offered undertakings they need to look at them very closely - ensure they are practically useful - and change Google's behaviour,"" he said.

ROME (Reuters) -The Italian government said on Friday it was restricting the use of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine to people over the age of 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting.
Camilla Canepa died on Thursday aged 18 after being given the vaccine on May 25, triggering a media and political outcry over the Anglo-Swedish company's shot being used for adults of all ages despite previously-raised medical concerns.
""AstraZeneca will only be used for people over 60,"" the country's special COVID commissioner Francesco Figliuolo told reporters.
People under the age of 60 who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca should be given a different vaccine for the second dose, the government's chief medical adviser Franco Locatelli said at the same news conference.
""The risk-benefit assessment has changed,"" Locatelli said, without mentioning the death of Canepa, who suffered from a low platelet count, brain haemorrhage and abdominal blood clots. 
AstraZeneca was not immediately available to comment.
Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations in March over concerns of rare blood clotting problems, mainly in young people.
It resumed them the following month with the recommendation the product be ""preferably"" used for people over the age of 60, after the European drug regulator said the benefits of the jab outweighed the risks. 
Several other European countries have also stopped giving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65.
However, as Mario Draghi's government sought to ramp up its vaccination drive, some Italian regions launched ""open days"" where the AstraZeneca shot was administered to people of any age from 18 upwards.
These included young women who are the group considered most at risk of the extremely rare blood clotting disorders.

The inoculation events, often held during evenings and weekends, were partly aimed at preventing AstraZeneca doses going to waste amid widespread reports of older people spurning the product and cancelling their vaccination appointments.
Around 46% of people in Italy have received at least one vaccine dose, while 23% are fully inoculated, figures broadly in line with most other EU countries.

MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish court on Friday postponed a hearing in the dispute between Santander (MC:SAN) and Italian banker Andrea Orcel over a withdrawn offer to make him chief executive, potentially spelling a lengthy delay in the long-running case.
Santander and Orcel ended up in the Madrid court after Spain's largest bank dropped plans to make Orcel, who was then the top investment banker at Swiss bank UBS, its CEO after a dispute over his pay package.
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the postponement, triggered by issues over remote hearings involving key witnesses, meant there could potentially be a delay of as much as six months in the high-stakes legal dispute. 
The court said in a statement that a new date would be set in due course, without giving any indication of when.
The proceedings were suspended last month after a request from Orcel's lawyer for UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Mark Shelton, head of performance and rewards at Switzerland's biggest bank, for them to testify.
Because of issues over their remote testimonies, Santander had asked the court judge Javier Sanchez Beltran to send a so-called rogatory commission to Switzerland, another source said.
""This would mean Weber and Shelton would testify before a judge in Switzerland,"" the source said, adding that this would guarantee a fair hearing under Spanish law.
This has to be done first before setting a new date for the hearing, hence a potential long delay, the first source said.
The court, Santander and Orcel's legal team all declined to comment on the postponement and next steps in the case.
OFFER LETTER
Sources have said that Weber was a key figure in the case, which involved UBS refusing to reduce a buyout payment to Orcel.
Among the witnesses still pending as in the hearing are Santander's general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales, who signed Orcel's original job offer, and Roberto di Bernardini, the Spanish bank's head of human resources at the time.
Santander boss Ana Botin last month defended in court the its withdrawal of Orcel's multi-million euro offer.

The case revolves around whether a four-page letter constituted a binding contract or a non-binding initial offer.
Pay has also been an issue for Orcel at UniCredit, where last month he only narrowly defeated a shareholder revolt over his up to 7.5 million euro ($9 million) package.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German trucks maker Traton is in the early stages of exploring a capital increase worth more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) as its takeover of U.S. peer Navistar (NYSE:NAV) draws to a close, three people close to the matter said.
Traton, which has a market capitalisation of about 13.7 billion euros, is contemplating raising its capital by about 10% in a deal that could happen as soon as after the summer break, the people said.
The company, in which Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) owns a 89.72% stake, in November agreed to pay $3.7 billion to buy the outstanding shares of Navistar to extend its reach in North America. The deal is expected to close early in the third quarter.
Traton financed the deal with debt, mainly relying on a loan it received from Volkswagen. It said at the time it wants to retain its investment grade rating following the transaction and would not rule out any refinancing instruments.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts last month wrote that Traton sees the ""100% debt funded Navistar acquisition as suboptimal given risk to the credit rating, suggesting a potential 1.2-1.4 billion euros of equity raise as optimal"".
Volkswagen would be unlikely to agree to a capital increase below the 27 euro issue price for Traton shares at its 2019 initial public offering as that would dilute the carmaker in an unacceptable way, one of the people said.
Traton and Volkswagen both declined to comment.
Traton, which owns the MAN and Scania brands, has the option of issuing up to 200 million additional shares on or before May 21, 2024, which would represent an increase of up to 40%.
Traton's shares have risen by more than a fifth year-to-date and closed at 27.36 euros on Friday, as demand for trucks has recovered from the trough caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Navistar earlier this week beat analysts' expectations with it quarterly earnings, posting a net income of $1.63 per diluted share, on revenues of $2.2 billion.

Navistar also holds a small stake in self-driving truck startup TuSimple, which listed in spring and which has seen its valuation jump to 10 billion euros since.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Atotech  (NYSE:ATC) shares rose more than 6% Friday on a StreetInsider report that  MKS Instruments  (NASDAQ:MKSI) has approached the specialty chemicals group with an acquisition offer.
MKS shares were weaker by 2.5%.
The target company has a market capitalization of $4.91 billion and the suitor almost double that at $9.76 billion.
The potential combination would expand MKS's offerings in chip manufacturing through the addition of Atotech's plating chemicals, the report said.
The deal, if it comes to pass, would come a few months after Atotech was floated on the stock market by its private equity owner  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG).
Based in Berlin, Atotech's offerings are used in the manufacturing of smartphones, as well as for automotive, heavy machinery and household appliances.
MKS is a manufacturer of instruments and systems used in the semiconductor, industrial technologies and life and health sciences industries.
As demand for smartphones, laptops, LEDs and smart devices booms in the post pandemic world, semiconductor and chip manufacturing is witnessing billions of dollars of investments from the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (SA:TSMC34), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). As a result, there is a strong demand for machines and raw materials that go into making those chips."

This amount reflects a $10 billion increase from its 2021 budget. In President Biden’s view, the U.S. should now seek to end “forever wars,” while investing in cutting-edge military capabilities. We think this suggests solid growth prospects for military contractors  Lockheed Martin  (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), L3Harris (LHX), and Textron (TXT). So, it could be wise to scoop up their shares now. Read on.The defense industry doesn’t often attract heightened investor attention because it doesn’t typically deliver growth prospects that are as solid as, say, the tech and other high growth industries. However, defense stocks do provide stability thanks to these companies’ long-term contracts with the government.
The Biden Administration’s proposed 2022 defense budget, which was released last month, seeks a colossal $753 billion for national defense. Within this amount, the Department of Defense (DOD) is asking Congress for $715 billion for funding weapons programs and key national security priorities. Given the uncertain global geopolitical environment currently, with emerging threats from China and Russia, this year's budget proposal is considered important. And investors’ interest in the sector is evidenced by the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF’s (PPA) 9% returns over the past three months.
The Pentagon's proposed procurement of advanced military equipment to replace aging equipment that is currently in service, along with technological advances, is expected to accelerate the defense sector’s growth. So, we think, aerospace and defense companies Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), and  Textron Inc . (NYSE:TXT) could witness solid growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s U.S. unit said a data breach at a vendor impacted more than 3.3 million customers and prospective buyers in North America.
Nearly all those impacted were current or potential customers of Audi, one of the German automaker's luxury brands.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America said on Friday an unauthorized third party obtained limited personal information about customers and interested buyers from a vendor that its Audi Volkswagen brands and some U.S. and Canadian dealers used for digital sales and marketing.
The information was gathered for sales and marketing between 2014 and 2019 and was in an electronic file the vendor left unsecured.
The company told regulators the vast majority of customers only had phone numbers and email addresses potentially impacted by the data breach. In some cases, data also includes information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about.
VW said 90,000 Audi customers and prospective buyers had sensitive data impacted relating to purchase or lease eligibility. VW said it will offer free credit protection services to those individuals.
The sensitive data was comprised of driver license numbers in more than 95% of cases. A small number of records included additional data like dates of birth, Social Security numbers and account numbers.
The automaker does not believe sensitive information is involved in Canada.

More than 3.1 million people affected are in the United States.
VW believes the data was obtained at some point between August 2019 and May of this year, when the automaker identified the source of the incident.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 12:12PM ET</span>",EU adds another rare blood condition as side effect of AstraZeneca shot,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) -Europe's drug regulator on Friday identified another very rare blood condition as a potential side effect of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine and said it was looking into cases of heart inflammation after inoculation with all coronavirus shots. 
The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) safety committee said that capillary leak syndrome (CLS) must be added as a new side effect to labelling on AstraZeneca's vaccine, known as Vaxzevria.
People who had previously sustained the condition, where fluids leak from the smallest blood vessels causing swelling and a drop in blood pressure, should not receive the shot, the EMA added.
The regulator first began looking into these cases in April and the recommendation adds to AstraZeneca's woes after its vaccine was associated with very rare and potentially lethal cases of blood clotting that come with a low platelet count.
Last month, the EMA had advised against giving a second AstraZeneca shot to people with that clotting condition, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).
The committee reviewed six validated cases of CLS in people, mostly women, who had received Vaxzevria, including one death. Three had a history of the condition.
More than 78 million Vaxzevria doses have been administered in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Iceland & Norway and Britain.
In a statement, AstraZeneca pointed to the extreme rarity of CLS cases, at less than 1 in 10 million vaccinated individuals. 
""We are working actively, in collaboration with regulatory authorities, on risk minimization measures... that includes information to those being vaccinated...information to drive early diagnosis and intervention, and appropriate treatment,"" the company said.
Britain’s regulator, the MHRA said it was considering precautionary advice for people with a history of CLS but does not see a causal link with the vaccine.
Two of eight reports of capillary leak syndrome following AstraZeneca vaccination in the UK were in people with a history of the condition, and 40 million doses of the vaccine had been given, it said.
Separately, the EMA said it was continuing its probe into cases of heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis, primarily following inoculation with the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA shots, but also after the J&J (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca vaccines. 
U.S. health officials said on Thursday they had registered a higher-than-expected number of heart inflammation cases in young men who received a second dose of the mRNA shots, though a causal relationship could not be established. 
Israel’s Health Ministry said this month it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.
Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna have acknowledged the observations but said a causal association with their vaccines has not been established. 
BioNTech said adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, are being regularly and thoroughly reviewed by the companies and regulatory authorities.

""More than 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive.""
The United States and Israel have been months ahead of the EU in vaccinating men below 30, who are particularly prone to heart inflammation, giving them potentially more cases to analyse.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 12:11PM ET</span>","Online wholesale marketplace Faire raises $260 million, valued at $7 billion","By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) -Online wholesale marketplace Faire said on Thursday it raised $260 million in its latest funding round and is now valued at $7 billion, thanks to the fast growth in e-commerce following the pandemic.
Faire helps small retailers connect with small brands, helping them to compete with retail giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, said Faire Chief Executive and co-founder Max Rhodes. He started the company as he experienced the challenges of finding sales channels for an upscale New Zealand umbrella brand he was trying to sell in the United States.
“We were flying all over the country, going to trade shows. We were emailing back and forth with retailers. Email was kind of the height of the technological innovation for us in that business,” said Rhodes.
There are an increasing number of tech companies that are helping small and medium-sized businesses grow online, offering shipping, payment, e-commerce platforms and marketing services, and making it possible to sell outside of the Amazon marketplace.
One of Faire’s most popular filters to add in merchandise searches is the “not on Amazon,” said Rhodes. He said the average retailer or brand on Faire's platform has about $250,000 in annual sales, but some are also growing big, fast.
Following its success in the U.S. market, Faire expanded into Europe three months ago and is seeing fast growth there, said Rhodes.
The funding round was led by Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley’s top venture capital firms. 

“We're still in the single-digit online penetration for the wholesale market,” said Sequoia partner Ravi Gupta. “We're in the very early innings of what we think is a multi-decade-long trend towards digitization on some of these things.”
The news was first reported by tech newsletter writer Eric Newcomer.

With the controversy getting further fueled by Biogen's $56,000 tag for the annual course of the medicine, there are fears that FDA's approval of Lilly's drug may be delayed.
 Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY), Biogen’s aduhelm became the first drug in 18 years to secure Food and Drug Administration’s nod for treatment of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease.
The FDA has been accused of ignoring the advice of its own outside advisors, who said Biogen did not provide enough evidence of clinical benefit over the existing prescriptions. Three of the advisory panel's members have resigned in protest since Monday’s decision by the regulator.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 11:31AM ET</span>",Analysis: Mines and votes - Socialist Castillo sweeps Peru's key mining regions,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's key mining regions overwhelming supported socialist Pedro Castillo, who looks on track to win the Andean country's tight presidential election and has pledged to sharply hike taxes on firms operating in the world's no. 2 copper producer.
The high support in districts where key mines are located underscores how tensions have burst through after years of conflict between mining firms and the local communities who often say they are left behind and do not share in the wealth.
In mining provinces such as Cotabambas, Espinar and Chumbivilcas, over nine out of 10 people voted for Castillo, election data show, propelling him to a narrow but sustained lead ahead of conservative rival Keiko Fujimori.
Those regions are home to major mines such as the huge Las Bambas copper mine, operated by China's MMG Ltd, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s Antapaccay and Constancia of Canada's Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM). In Chumbivilcas Castillo won 96.5% of votes.
""The people have awakened,"" Castillo told supporters on Thursday night. He has previously criticized mining firms for ""plundering"" the country's wealth and has maintained taxation on mineral profits will have to rise sharply to raise funds.
Overall, the election data showed that Castillo received more than 65% support in at least 10 provinces where key copper, gold, silver, and zinc mines are located, giving him a strong mandate in those areas to push reforms.
The election has not yet officially been called, but Castillo is expected to hold on to his narrow 50.2%-49.8% lead after gaining strong support from poor rural areas with pledges to redraft Peru's constitution and redistribute mineral wealth. (Graphic: Peru: Mines and votes - https://graphics.reuters.com/PERU-ELECTION/yxmvjaerepr/chart.png) 
Fujimori, a divisive but market-friendly candidate, had looked to lure support from mining regions with a pledge to give funds raised from mining directly to local communities, but the move appears to have fallen short with voters.
Castillo meanwhile promised a far larger shake-up, with plans to retain up to 70% of mining profits, which he wants to invest in healthcare and education reforms, especially in mineral-rich areas that have high poverty rates.
Mining firms have largely waited on the sidelines to see how things shake out, hopeful that a split vote and fragmented Congress, where no party will have a majority, will help temper any sharp reforms.
""We need to recognize what happened here and that what has led to the polarization is the frustration of years due to the political instability and the inefficiency of the state,"" said Roque Benavides, president of Buenaventura mining firm.
He denied that the issue was with the mining industry, though said that firms could be compelled to make voluntary contribution payments in discussion with a new administration.
""I feel that the political circumstances could lead us to that a little. But nothing will be achieved if there is not efficient spending and investment,"" he added
The mining sector represents some 60% of Peru's total exports and will be key as the country looks to bounce back from the world's deadliest per capita COVID-19 outbreak, which has triggered an economic collapse and sharp rise in poverty.
The strong support for Castillo was not only in areas where large mines are already developed, but also where new mining sites are being built, an analysis of the data showed.
He received some 86.3% of he vote in the southern district of Torata, where  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and Japan's Mitsubishi are developing the $5.3 billion Quellaveco copper mine, set to begin production in 2022.

In the area of Haquira, home to a $1.8 billion planned project by Canadian First Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO), 96% of the residents chose Castillo over Fujimori.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Archer Aviation unveiled its first electric flying taxi ""Maker"" in a Tesla-style debut on Thursday as an increasing number of investors and aviation companies pile into the hot but yet-to-be-approved urban air mobility space.
Interest in zero-emission aircraft that take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes is growing as aerospace companies look for new markets and face pressure to help decarbonize their industry though the battery-operated vehicles.
Maker's debut, staged at a hangar using XR technology to simulate a ride, followed news on Thursday of two separate deals involving electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft companies based in Britain and Brazil.
Archer's aircraft does not yet fly commercially but it mounted an extravagant show under a new chief creative officer who has decades of experience in experiential design and television production, Kenny Taht, to attract attention.
Archer expects Maker's commercial launch in 2024 in Los Angeles and Miami and is in the process of certifying the piloted four-passenger aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, co-founder and co-CEO Brett Adcock told Reuters.
""Our real goal is to make a mass market transportation solution in and around cities,"" Adcock said.
The taxis can fly at 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour) for distances up to 60 miles (100km) at an entry level price between $3 and $4 per passenger mile. 
In New York City for example, the 17-mile trip from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan would cost $50 to $70 and take around five to seven minutes versus 60 to 90 minutes in a car. 
While experts estimate the eVTOL market to be worth billions over the next decade, it is not expected to immediately make money and the timing of regulatory approval remains uncertain.
Asked about the approval process, the FAA said: ""The FAA can certify new technologies such as eVTOLs through its existing regulations. We may issue special conditions or additional requirements, depending on the type of project.""
As the market heats up, so has competition.
Archer is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Boeing-backed competitor Wisk Aero, which has accused it of stealing trade secrets and infringing on its patents.

Archer last week asked a California court to dismiss the lawsuit and courtersued Wisk for ""false statements"" regarding a separate criminal probe.
Archer plans to go public through a $3.8 billion merger with blank-check company Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Crest and has an investment and $1 billion order from United Airlines.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares fell more than 1% Friday after the Food and Drug Administration asked it to throw out 60 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine that were made at a troubled Baltimore plant.
The FDA plans to allow about 10 million doses to be distributed in the U.S. or be sent to other countries, but with a warning that regulators cannot guarantee that Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS), the company that operates the plant, followed good manufacturing practices, NYT said.
The FDA had been trying to figure out the fate of at least 170 million doses of vaccine left in limbo after the discovery of a major production mishap involving two vaccines manufactured at the site.
More than 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine and at least 70 million doses of AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) were put on hold after Emergent discovered in March that its workers had contaminated a batch of J&J with a key ingredient used to produce the U.K. company’s shots.
The Emergent plant remains shut.
J&J’s Covid vaccine is the only one in the world being given as a single shot. All others need two doses.

Germany is Amazon's biggest market after the United States, and the Verdi union has been organising strikes at Amazon in the country since 2013 to protest low pay and poor conditions. 
The pay increase is effective from July and compares with entry-level pay as low as 11.30 euros per hour for some locations, though pay exceeded 12 euros in other locations.
Amazon's wages exceed Germany's current minimum wage of 9.50 euros per hour. But workers have regularly gone on strike, such as last year to coincide with the $1.6 trillion company's global ""Prime Day"" promotion event. They were disgruntled that a coronavirus bonus had been scrapped.
A Verdi official said that the increase was the least that the company could do after ""earning a pretty penny in recent months"" and that pay still fell short of its demands for many employees. 
Amazon - which saw net profit rise to $8.1 billion in the first quarter, more than tripling from $2.5 billion the year earlier - has faced similar criticism over conditions and pay throughout the globe. 

A spokesperson for Amazon in Germany said all employees would be getting a raise, and Amazon said in a statement that further increases were scheduled for the future.

Bernstein’s outperform rating sees the Biogen stock at $500, an upside of 22% from the stock’s current level of $410.
According to analyst Aaron Gal, market circumstance will allow for strong adoption of Biogen’s ‘aduhelm’ and that regulatory scrutiny of the price of the new Alzheimer's drug will come later.
He sees aduhelm sales reaching $10 billion in 2023, with conservative assumptions.

Investing.com – Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) shares fell 1% early on in Friday’s trading as the company faces a $200 million copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of music publishers.
The National Music Publishers’ Association has sued Roblox seeking at least $200 million in damages for the illegal consumption of music on the social gaming platform.
The video game platform company is accused of allowing developers to insert features or boomboxes into games that play copyrighted music without permission or any payment.
The NMPA says the unauthorized music includes songs by Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, Ed Sheeran, the Rolling Stones and others.
“Roblox actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable,” the complaint says, according to WSJ.
Roblox had 42.1 million daily users as of March. “We expeditiously respond to any valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act request by removing any infringing content and, in accordance with our stringent repeat infringer policy, taking action against anyone violating our rules,” Roblox wrote in a mail to Investing.com.It said the lawsuit represents “a fundamental misunderstanding” of how the Roblox platform operates, and “will defend Roblox vigorously as we work to achieve a fair resolution."""
1689,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",GameStop lures Amazon talent with grand plans and no frills,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -GameStop Corp Chairman Ryan Cohen made a point of doing away with corporate excess such as a company plane and used the allure of rebuilding the videogame retailer to recruit Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Australia chief Matt Furlong as chief executive, according to people familiar with the process.
Cohen wanted the message to be stern, said the sources, who were close to the discussions. The transformation of the ailing brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce powerhouse would require laser-like focus and determination, Cohen told Furlong.
The role would come with no frills, but it would pay off handsomely in GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares if the turnaround was successful. The majority of Furlong's performance-based compensation will be tied to stock awards.
The move represents Cohen's boldest gambit yet in his push to attract talent from Amazon. GameStop's market value has soared to $16 billion from $250 million a year ago, as amateur traders challenged hedge funds betting against the company and turned it into a popular ""meme"" stock on Reddit and other social media. 
Most analysts say the valuation of the company is out of whack with the fundamentals of its business, representing a bold bet for any GameStop recruit who accepts the volatile stock as part of their compensation.
GameStop on Wednesday announced the hiring of Furlong alongside that of Amazon's North American consumer business financial chief Mike Recupero as its chief financial officer. They were the latest Amazon veterans poached by Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc, who joined GameStop's board in January.
In March, Cohen tapped Amazon operations executive Jenna Owens as chief operating officer, one month after bringing in top Amazon Web Services engineer Matt Francis as chief technology officer. Another Amazon executive in the e-commerce giant's grocery business, Elliott Wilke, was hired in April as chief growth officer.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.
Cohen spent two months speaking to more than 50 potential CEO candidates from a range of industries, including gaming and e-commerce, the sources said. Cohen and Furlong had discussed a potential role for him at Chewy more than six years ago, and someone in Cohen's network pointed him back to Furlong as a strong CEO candidate for GameStop, one of the sources added.
Based in Miami, Cohen called Furlong in Australia and held a series of virtual meetings that later included GameStop's board members. The job description called for fixing the company's distribution network, deconstructing its website and delivering on Cohen's vision of high-touch customer service, according to the sources.
Furlong would be expected to spend long hours on the job without the perks enjoyed by outgoing GameStop CEO George Sherman, such as a company plane and executive assistants, Cohen told him. While Sherman will remain on GameStop's board, he is leaving the CEO role because the board decided he lacks the necessary e-commerce expertise, according to the sources.
A representative for Sherman declined to comment.
In his discussions with Furlong, Cohen said previous GameStop executives let order-processing operations and customer service languish, the sources said. Were Furlong to fix these problems, he would be rewarded generously with GameStock shares.
Full details of Furlong's compensation package have not yet been disclosed by GameStop. The company said in a regulatory filing this week it would give Furlong $16.5 million worth of GameStop stock over the next four years, as well as a $4.7 million sign-on bonus to be paid over the next two years, contingent on his continuous employment. His annual base salary will be $200,000.
Furlong, 42, was eager for the challenge and happy to relocate to GameStop's headquarters in Grapevine, Texas, the sources said.
Some GameStop board members even played up the challenges Furlong would face in transforming the company into an ""Amazon of videogames"" to make sure he was committed.
""We wanted to know why you would leave the safety and comfort of your current position, essentially kiss your family good-bye, and get in there to build something from the ground up,"" one of the sources familiar with the board's thinking said.
Cohen also acknowledged during the interview process that the transformation would take time, the sources said. 
Representatives for GameStop, Cohen and Furlong declined to comment.
""We have a lot of work in front of us. You won't find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises or telegraphing our strategy to the competition, that's the philosophy we adopted at Chewy,"" Cohen told GameStop shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
FINANCIAL FIREPOWER
It's not clear how hands-off Cohen, 35, will be at GameStop once Furlong assumes his duties on June 21. Cohen has been obsessing about customer service, personally calling GameStop customers late into the night to solicit feedback, and has made a push to upgrade the company's website and online ordering system, Reuters reported in March.

GameStop said on Wednesday it remained loss-making, though it trimmed its first-quarter operating loss to $40.8 million from $108 million a year ago. 
Furlong will have plenty of financial firepower to deploy in his new mission. GameStop has already sold more than $550 million in stock since the Reddit rally began in January, some of which it used to pay off is debt and launch a 700,000-square-foot warehousing facility in York, Pennsylvania. The company said on Wednesday it would seek to sell up to 5 million more shares, currently worth $1.1 billion.

Ireland's economy is hugely reliant on multinational firms that employ around one in eight Irish workers and any move to facilitate remote working abroad would add to the challenge already posed by a planned global corporate tax overhaul. 
Facebook, which is one of Ireland's largest such employers with around 3,000 full-time staff and another 3,000 contractors, will allow some workers to permanently relocate after more than a year of many working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Eligible employees in Facebook offices in Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom will be able to move to another one of those locations. U.S.-based staff can also move to Canada, it added. 
Facebook Ireland's Gareth Lambe said it was still working out how many Irish-based employees would be eligible to take advantage of the policy. Fewer than half of its staff are Irish nationals. 
""We're going to continue to grow aggressively,"" he told national broadcaster RTE, citing a move in the next year or two to a new 57,000 square metre campus in Dublin that it intends to fill with 7,000 employees.
""This won't have on balance a material impact on the growth of employment for Facebook in Ireland,"" he said, referring to the remote working policy. ""We have a target this year of adding about an additional 700 employees and we're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to grow,""
""But this is a significant evolution and in the future over the coming years and decades, it is possible that the growth of jobs and numbers may not be as fast in Ireland as it would have been before it."" 

Lambe said Facebook's main Europe, Middle East and Africa decision makers will continue to be based in Dublin, meaning its corporate tax status will not change. However those permanently relocating abroad would no longer pay income tax in Ireland.
Responding to the move, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said one of the consequences of the pandemic will be a lot more mobility of workers across national borders but that foreign direct investment will remain ""an indispensable part"" of Ireland's economic model.

Earlier this month, it announced the sale of some assets to private equity firm Aquiline Capital Partners and tech firm Alight for $1.4 billion in a bid to get U.S. approval for the Willis deal.
Aon and Willis put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for anything from airlines to large sporting events.

Vertical Aerospace said it has pre-orders for up to 1,000 eVTOL aircraft with launch customers Avolon and American Airlines, along with a pre-order option from Virgin Atlantic, all valued at up to $4 billion.
""If you think about transportation strategically this is the next big frontier,"" Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, the world's third-largest aircraft leasing company, told Reuters in an interview.
""Whether it is airlines operating this as an add-on product or ride sharing businesses in different jurisdictions, I think it is going to take a lot of different forms over time.""
Investment in the zero-emission electric aircraft comes at a time when aviation companies are under mounting pressure from investors to help decarbonize the sector and boost their environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores.
Analysts say a key question is how long it will take for the new electric aircraft to be certified by aviation authorities.
Europe's top regulator said last month the region could see the first flying taxis enter service as early as 2024. (https://reut.rs/3cyehAh)
Vertical will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'EVTL', following a deal with Broadstone Acquisition Corp. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2021.

American Airlines and Avolon, as well as Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) and Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), have invested in Vertical via a private investment in public equity transaction, the company said.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s venture fund M12, investment manager 40 North and venture capital firm Rocket Internet SE are also some of Vertical's investors, the company said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) watch out - one of the world's largest aircraft owners says passenger planes could see their wings clipped by the rapid spread of flying taxi startups.
Commercial air travel already faces competition from high-speed trains in parts of the world. But the head of Irish aircraft leasing firm Avolon said competition would shift skywards as it invested up to $2 billion in aerial shuttles.
Avolon is among the launch customers for up to 1,000 electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVOTL) aircraft being developed by Britain's Vertical Aerospace, which plans to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm.
German air shuttle startup Lilium said in March it would float on the U.S. stock market via a similar process. 
The deals reflect growing interest in battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically, offering a new way for travellers to beat traffic and hop between cities. 
Vertical's VA-X4 has a range of 120 miles but that could be extended further, Avolon Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery said on late Thursday.
""The challenge for incumbent (planemakers) is if the range can extend to 400-500 miles, what is the implication for traditional narrowbodies?"" he said in a Reuters interview.
Asked if the vehicles for four passengers and a pilot could take business from much larger commercial planes, Slattery said, ""Eventually, yes of course. This is the inevitable future.""
Planemakers have themselves invested in such projects.
PARTNERSHIPS
Helicopter travel could also be squeezed. 
""You have got to think that you have these machines that can disintermediate the legacy helicopters through just being 100 times quieter and no emissions,"" Slattery said.
Avolon has placed a firm order for 310 eVTOLs worth $1.25 billion and 190 options worth $750 million, Slattery said.
They will join an owned or managed fleet of 568 passenger aircraft all the way up to the 396-seat Boeing 777-300ER. 
Slattery said Avolon had not decided how to deploy the air taxis, whose relatively short product development cycles mark a shift for leasing companies used to long-term jet investments.
""We could partner with airlines, we could establish our own entities in different jurisdictions around the world, we could partner with helicopter operators,"" Slattery said.
""I think it is going to take a lot of different forms over time. But the technology is here and we are going to lead commercialisation of it with zero-emission credentials"".
The move comes at a time when aviation companies are jostling for leadership of the environmental agenda as they came under pressure from investors to help decarbonise flying and bolster their environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores.

Vertical Aerospace says eVTOL aircraft can help the industry meet carbon reduction goals through zero emissions and electrical power, where possible derived from renewable energy.
But experts say questions remain over the timing of safety certification, which eVOTL suppliers expect as early as 2024.

Athene CEO Jim Belardi, along with its directors Mitra Hormozi, Marc Beilinson and Lynn Swann will join Apollo's board upon closing of the merger with Athene, which is expected around January 2022.
The new appointments come after Leon Black, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago, left his executive positions at the company earlier this year, a surprise move that added to a series of corporate governance changes triggered by a review of his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Last month, Apollo said co-founder Joshua Harris will step down from his day-to-day role at the firm after the $11 billion all-stock merger with annuities provider Athene closes next year.
Apollo had about $461 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of retail investors in Europe has doubled since the start of last year as stay-at-home rules and high savings rates during the pandemic triggered a surge in stock investing by non-professionals, according to data from Euronext.
The trend is still less prevalent in Europe than in the United States, where retail investor participation in stock markets soared last summer before hitting extreme levels in January.
So-called meme stocks like U.S. video-retailer Gamestop Corp and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings saw record inflows fuelled by retail investors sharing investment strategies on social media.
Trading in Europe is more fragmented given the number of different stock exchanges in the region. 
Still, the share of total trading carried out by retail investors jumped to nearly 7% by mid-2020 from 2% in 2019, before settling at around 5% currently, Euronext said.
By comparison, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Daniel Fannon estimated in January that retail can represent up to 32% of total U.S. equity volume.
Meanwhile, the number of retail investors has doubled over the past 18 months on Euronext, the exchange's CEO Stephane Boujnah told Reuters.
Following its purchase of Borsa Italiana last year, Euronext controls a quarter of the equity trading flow in Europe with exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Dublin, according to analysts.
Boujnah said market abuse regulations in Europe are much stricter than in the U.S., making it difficult for retail investors to combine forces and defeat the short selling strategy of some funds, a key driver of the ""U.S. meme stock phenomenon"".
Retail investors have also flocked to easy-to-use share trading platforms such as etoro, which signed up 3.1 million new registered users in the first quarter of 2021, compared to 5.2 million through all of 2020.
In the U.S., the trend accelerated after large brokers like Schwab and Fidelity dropped their trading commissions, following startups like Robinhood and Social Finance Inc.

A market structure analyst at a European brokerage said Euronext's success in tapping retail interest was partly due to the exchange having a dedicated retail program, when in most European countries retail orders are sent to the local exchange. 
""It is a bit of a mishmash and in my view, the European retail trading landscape is ripe for change,"" he said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to talk to the media.

ISS recommends shareholders to vote against the proposal while Glass Lewis encourages them to vote in favour.
Controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mediaset plans to move its legal headquarters to the Netherlands in a first step to create a pan-European TV champion pursuing alliances with peers.
The move is part of a deal between Mediaset and its second largest investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) to end a long-running legal dispute.. 
Under the terms of the agreement, French media giant Vivendi, which holds a 29% stake in Mediaset, pledged to give its essential backing to the proposal at broadcaster's annual general meeting on June 23.
""We find no reason to oppose the relocation of the company's headquarters on the basis of the strategic rationale provided,"" Glass Lewis said in its report.

However, ISS said the move ""is not supported by a sufficiently compelling rationale and might negatively impact minority shareholders' rights."" 
It pointed out that ""although the new bylaws do not include loyalty voting mechanisms, those may be introduced at a later stage through a resolution passed with an absolute majority of votes cast.""

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 08:37AM ET</span>",South African government sells majority stake in airline SAA to consortium,"By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -The South African government is selling a 51% stake in South African Airways (SAA) to Takatso consortium, which will initially commit more than 3 billion rand ($221 million) to give the struggling airline a new lease of life. 
SAA has been under a form of bankruptcy protection since December 2019, but its fortunes worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic and all its operations were mothballed in September 2020 when funds ran low. 
The airline is one of a handful of South African state companies that depend on government bailouts, placing the national budget under huge strain at a time of rapidly rising debt.
The partnership with Takatso will alleviate that financial burden, public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan told journalists on Friday as the state would no longer provide any funding to the airline, which exited administration in late April after receiving 7.8 billion rand from the government. 
Gordhan added that the government will retain a 49% stake with the intention of eventually listing the airline to address future funding requirements. 
""The objective of bringing in an equity partner to SAA is to augment it with the required technical, financial and operational expertise to ensure a sustainable, agile and viable South African airline,"" he said.
The consortium includes pan-African investor group Harith Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) and aviation group Global Aviation, Gordhan said. 
Following the announcement, co-founder and consortium Chair Tshepo Mahloele told Reuters that 3 billion rand should be sufficient to operate the airline for 12 to 36 months.
The government could dispose of more of its ownership stake going forward, he added.
""They aren't married to this 49%,"" he said. ""They won't be putting more money into this asset.""
An initial public offering for the airline is unlikely to happen within the next three years, and SAA would first need to become profitable, Takatso Chief Executive Gidon Novick said. 
Novick said Takatso would seek to relaunch SAA as soon as possible, prioritising first domestic service followed by regional destinations. 
International long-haul routes would follow but would be selected carefully, and SAA would also work to forge partnerships with major carriers.
""We're going to be competing with the greatest airlines in the world, and we need to be mindful of that,"" Novick said.
The airline's subsidiaries meanwhile will be evaluated, in particular Air Chefs, SAA Technical and low-cost airline Mango, Gordhan said, noting that ""anything can happen"" when asked if some could be shut down.

SAA will continue to be domiciled in South Africa and the government will have a ""golden share"" of 33% of the entity's voting rights and certain areas of national interest, Gordhan said.
