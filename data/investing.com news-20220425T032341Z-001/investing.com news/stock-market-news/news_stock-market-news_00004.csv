Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning, with investors digesting the latest economic data from China. Crude oil is on a downward trend as the prospect of conflict over Ukraine subsided somewhat after Russia said it would withdraw some forces.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.69% by 9:31 PM ET (2:31 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.60%. Data released earlier in the day showed that China's consumer price index grew 0.9% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month in January. The producer price index rose 9.1% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.34%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.04% South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.59%. In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.60%.
Russia announced on Tuesday that it would partially pull back thousands of troops currently stationed near the border with Ukraine and appeared to signal its preference for a diplomatic solution to the situation.
Safe havens sold off on Tuesday in reaction to the announcement, with the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield rising to its highest level since May 2021. Bonds in Australia and New Zealand also retreated.
However, U.S. President Joe Biden said his country has yet to verify that any Russian troops have been pulled back, maintaining that an invasion of Ukraine is still possible.
Russian troops remain in a “threatening position,” Biden argued, but he agreed with Monday’s Russian declaration that diplomacy is still possible. However, he would not “sacrifice basic principles” that countries, including Ukraine, should have the right to keep their own borders.
The crisis in Ukraine added more volatility into a market already jittery over the prospect of aggressive interest rate hikes from central banks.
“Volatility and uncertainty are just going to be heightened, that can be due to Russia-Ukraine, it could be due to stubborn inflation,” UBS financial advisor Brenda O’Connor Juanas told Bloomberg.
“There is a lot more for clients and investors to be uncertain about.”
However, the latest Russian comments are a hopeful sign and assets like the ruble and Russian stocks have recovery potential, Macro-Advisory Ltd. founder and senior partner Christopher Weafer told Bloomberg.
“But frankly after several months of high risk and speculation, it’s going to take several weeks for people to get comfortable with that, no matter what happens in the next couple of days,” he said.
Investors now await the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last meeting, due later in the day. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will speak on Thursday, with more officials, including Charles Evans, Christopher Waller, and Lael Brainard, speaking at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum a day later.
G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors will also meet from Feb. 17 to 18."

(Reuters) -Australia's Liontown Resources said on Wednesday it signed a five-year agreement with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply lithium spodumene concentrate to the electric carmaker, sending the lithium miner's shares up nearly 20%.
Tesla will buy 100,000 dry metric tonnes (DMT) of the concentrate in the first year starting 2024, increasing to 150,000 DMT per year in subsequent years. 
Lithium prices have soared in the past few years, with suppliers scrambling to meet demand as automakers lean towards electric vehicles. The prices are about eight times higher than they were at the start of 2021. 
Liontown will supply lithium from its flagship Kathleen Valley Lithium project in Western Australia that is expected to begin commercial production by 2025. The supply to Tesla will account for about a third of the project's annual production capacity. 
Liontown already has a lithium supply deal with the battery unit of South Korea's LG Chem from the project. 

Liontown shares jumped as much as 19.8% to A$1.665, their biggest intraday jump since Sept. 13, 2021.

(Reuters) - Having lost at trial on Tuesday, Republican Sarah Palin has signaled she could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court with her libel lawsuit against the New York Times, one of several cases that could challenge the 1964 ""actual malice"" legal standard for public figures to prove defamation.
Here are some of the others:
CHURCH LAWSUIT
The U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether to take up a challenge to the actual malice test in a Florida megachurch's lawsuit claiming it was falsely designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center legal advocacy organization. The church, Coral Ridge Ministries, is backed by briefs from a number of religious and conservative groups who argue that the high bar to prove defamation claims has given media outlets a license to print lies.
CONGRESSMAN'S LAWSUIT
Devin Nunes, a Republican former U.S. congressman from California, is pursuing a lawsuit claiming journalist Ryan Lizza defamed him in an Esquire article that said Nunes' family employed immigrants in the United States illegally on an Iowa dairy farm. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case last year, finding that Lizza may have shown actual malice by posting a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) link to the article months after it was published, and after Nunes sued.
VOTING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY'S LAWSUIT
Dominion Voting Systems is seeking $1.6 billion in a defamation lawsuit accusing Fox News of amplifying false conspiracy theories about its role in the 2020 presidential election. Fox has denied the claims. A judge in Delaware denied the network's motion to dismiss the voting machine company's case in December.
ACTIVIST GROUP'S LAWSUIT
Right-wing group Project Veritas is suing the New York Times for calling videos the group produced about alleged voter fraud ""deceptive."" The Times also claimed Project Veritas has a history of producing misleading and selectively edited videos about controversial topics. A New York state appeals court on Feb. 10 said the newspaper could publish excerpts of Project Veritas' internal memos while the Times' appeal of a judge's order barring their publication is pending. 

RAPPER'S LAWSUIT
A jury in Atlanta awarded rapper Cardi B nearly $4 million in January over claims that a celebrity blogger posted dozens of videos making false claims about her, including that she had cheated on her husband and had previously worked as a prostitute. The blogger, Tasha K, had argued that she believed the claims about Cardi B were true and had not acted maliciously in reporting them. Tasha K's lawyers have said they will appeal the verdict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing whether financial executives may have broken the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares, known as ""block trades,"" according to a source with knowledge of the matter. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the probe on Monday. The newspaper said the SEC was investigating  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), along with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
All four parties declined to comment.
Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.
Block trading tends to increase during times of volatility as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. 
Information on such share sales ahead of time could be extremely valuable. Inappropriately sharing material, nonpublic information could run afoul of U.S. laws, the source said. Firms could also face scrutiny if they fail to have processes in place to prevent misuse of information.

The SEC has sent subpoenas to several hedge funds and banks, demanding trading records and information about investors' communication with bankers, according to the WSJ report, which also said regulators had begun looking into irregularities related to block trades since at least 2019.
Investigators are probing whether bankers improperly alerted favored clients ahead of public disclosure of trades and if such information benefited the funds, some of which act as ""liquidity providers"" to Wall Street firms, the report said.

The local unit of French retailer Carrefour SA (OTC:CRRFY) posted an adjusted net income of 766 million reais ($148.48 million), down 13.5% from a year earlier but above a Refinitiv Eikon analysts' estimate of 738.2 million reais.
Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 1.4% to 1.8 billion reais. 
Sales measured by net revenue rose 4% to 20.6 billion reais, as its Atacadao unit posted a 6.4% growth in sales.
Operating expenses were at 2.5 billion reais, a 13.4% rise from a year earlier.
Carrefour Brasil said it has opened nine new Cash & Carry stores and two new wholesale units during the fourth quarter, ending the year with a total 779 stores.
Carrefour Brasil reported its quarterly results after the acquisition of Grupo BIG Brasil for 7.5 billion reais was approved by Brazil's antitrust regulator Cade in January.
In a separate securities filing on Tuesday, the company said the costs savings estimated from the deal were now seen 15% above its initial forecast, adding that its adjusted EBITDA will be increased by 2 billion reais on an annual basis in three years.

""Our multi-format, multi-channel ecosystem has strengthened further, and the closing of the acquisition of Grupo BIG, expected until June, whose synergy targets have been raised, should contribute to another year of growth in 2022,"" said Carrefour Brasil Chief Executive Stephane Marquaire.

(Reuters) -Airbnb Inc forecast on Tuesday a better-than-expected first-quarter revenue after the short-term home rental company reported strong quarterly results on rising domestic travel and longer stays by guests at higher prices.
While the San Francisco-based company was initially hit by the pandemic, its business rebounded as people took trips closer to home where they stayed for longer to work remotely. The trend has since continued with ""non-urban gross nights"" booked up about 45% in the fourth quarter versus 2019.
""There's this entire acceleration in this new category of travel, which is that people are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said during a conference call with analysts.
Strong demand helped push up prices charged by hosts, with average daily rates during the fourth quarter up 20% at $154. The company expects the higher rates to bolster first-quarter results.
""Positive ADR trends into early 2022 should alleviate fears of a more rapid normalization in pricing,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.
Airbnb said it expects current-quarter revenue between $1.41 billion and $1.48 billion, higher than analysts' estimates of $1.24 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Bookings are expected to significantly exceed pre-pandemic levels, leading to a record gross booking value.
Airbnb reported a profit of 8 cents per share and revenue of $1.53 billion. Analysts had expected the company to earn 3 cents per share and a revenue of $1.46 billion.
The company, which is not particularly reliant on big cities to generate revenue, got a boost from travel demand, with the hospitality sector shrugging off a temporary impact from the Omicron variant.

Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc reported results on Tuesday that beat estimates and the hotel chain said travel recovery remained intact.
Airbnb's shares were up 3.7% at $186.73 in after-market trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prosecutors on Monday accused a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker of seeking to make millions of dollars laundering money looted from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, at the outset of a trial that could shed light on the bank's response to warnings of corruption.
Roger Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law.
""The defendant saw an opportunity to make millions of dollars by cheating, and he took it,"" Brent Wible, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice, said in an opening statement on Monday.
Ng has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer has said he is a ""fall guy"" for one of the biggest financial scandals in Wall Street history.
The trial in Brooklyn federal court could last up to six weeks.
The scandal stems from some $6.5 billion in bonds that Goldman helped 1MDB, launched by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to spur economic growth, sell from 2009 to 2014. 
U.S. prosecutors say Goldman earned $600 million in fees from the deals, but that around $4.5 billion of the funds raised was embezzled.
The bank in 2020 paid a $2.3 billion fine, returned $600 million in ill-gotten gains and agreed for its Malaysian subsidiary to plead guilty in U.S. court as part of a deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).
Wible said Ng helped two co-conspirators - his former boss, Timothy Leissner, and Malaysian intermediary Jho Low - launder funds embezzled from 1MDB and used some of the stolen money to bribe officials in the Southeast Asian country to win business for Goldman.
Ng received $35 million in kickbacks from Leissner, Wible said.
Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, in 2018 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money, and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), in part by helping to pay $1.6 billion in bribes. He is expected to testify as a government witness against Ng. 
Wible said Leissner, who has not yet been sentenced, would testify against Ng as part of a cooperation agreement with prosecutors and as a result would get a lighter punishment. But Wible said Leissner's testimony would be backed up by other evidence. 
Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo countered that Ng had no role in the scheme perpetrated by Low and Leissner, and that he even warned Goldman management not to trust Low. He said the funds prosecutors called kickbacks in fact belonged to Ng's wife and were derived from a business venture she had with Leissner's ex-wife. 
Agnifilo focused his opening statement largely on undermining Leissner, who is expected to testify for the government.

""They're not partners-in-crime. There's a gulf between these two men a mile wide,"" he said. ""Leissner uses people. You will see this time and time again. He is trying to use my client ... to serve his jail time.""
Low, who was indicted alongside Ng in 2018, has not been arrested by U.S. or Malaysian authorities. Malaysia has said he is in China, which Beijing has denied.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 07:56PM ET</span>","U.S. to inspect new 787 Dreamliners, says Boeing cannot self-certify","By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said it would perform final inspections on new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner aircraft, and will not allow the planemaker to self-certify the jets.
The U.S. aviation regulator said it notified Boeing of the decision that it will retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident ""Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards."" 
Boeing said it ""will continue to work transparently through (the FAA's) detailed and rigorous processes... We will continue to engage with the FAA to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements.""
Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 in late May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. The FAA had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes and identified a new issue in July.
Deliveries have remained halted as U.S. regulators reviewed repairs and inspections. Deliveries are expected to remain frozen months longer. 
The FAA said it wants Boeing to ensure it ""has a robust plan for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage"" and that ""Boeing’s delivery processes are stable.""
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio praised the FAA for ""taking much-needed steps to ensure the safety of the flying public."" He noted the committee has been investigating the production and manufacture of the 787.
The 787 program remains at a low production rate, with an expected gradual return to five per month over time, Boeing said.
Boeing disclosed a $3.5 billion charge due to delivery delays and customer concessions, and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs, related to production flaws and related repairs and inspections on the advanced composite jet.
The FAA previously retained the right to issue certifications for the first four Boeing 787s when the company briefly resumed deliveries in early 2021.

Boeing shares rose 3.7% on Tuesday.
Factory changes and other requirements to overcome tiny structural blemishes have raised longer-term questions over Boeing's ability to build 787s at a sufficiently low cost and at the rates once planned, a person familiar with the matter said.

Fortescue said costs for the half jumped by a fifth. Australian miners have been burdened by a shortage of workers in resource-rich Western Australia state due to lockdowns and border closures to control a recent wave of Omicron COVID-19 infections.
The miner posted an underlying net profit of $2.78 billion, compared with $4.08 billion a year earlier, but reiterated its full-year forecast of shipments, costs and capital expenditure. Analysts expected a profit of $2.70 billion, according to Vuma Financial.
""We remain focused on managing industry cost pressures and challenges posed by Western Australia's ongoing border restrictions,"" Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said.
""We are working closely with the Western Australian government and relevant authorities to ensure we have access to the specialist skills required.""
Fortescue declared an interim dividend of 86 Australian cents per share, compared with A$1.47 per share a year earlier.
Its shares fell as much as 4.5% to A$20.61, trailing the broader market which gained 0.4%.

China's push to curb emissions and easing construction activity in its debt-laden property sector has led to prices of the steel-making commodity halving from record levels last year.

Analysts expect iron ore prices to stabilise this year, but remain some way away from last year's peak. BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said on Tuesday commodity price volatility will continue for some time, though outlook for demand and pricing remains strong.
Fortescue also said its Iron Bridge magnetite project was progressing well, with first production scheduled in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. jury on Tuesday ruled against Sarah Palin in her libel lawsuit accusing the New York Times of defaming her in a 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked her to a mass shooting, after the presiding judge already had said he would dismiss the case regardless of the verdict.
The nine-person jury in Manhattan federal court needed about two days to unanimously conclude that the Times was not liable to Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate.
Palin is expected to appeal.
Her case is considered a major test of libel protections for American media under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment free press guarantee and under a landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision, New York Times v Sullivan.
That decision established an ""actual malice"" standard for public figures like Palin to prove defamation, meaning that media knowingly published false information or had a reckless disregard for the truth.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said Palin had not met that ""very high"" standard, even as he faulted the Times for ""very unfortunate editorializing"" in ""America's Lethal Politics,"" the editorial Palin challenged.
He said letting the jurors reach a verdict could avoid complications should Palin appeal.
Rakoff told the jury about his planned dismissal only after they had finished deliberations.
""We reached the same bottom line, but on different grounds,"" he told jurors. ""You decided the facts. I decided the law.""
The trial lasted nine days.
""We are obviously disappointed with the verdict. We are obviously disappointed with yesterday's order,"" Palin's lawyer Kenneth Turkel told reporters outside the courthouse.
He said Palin would evaluate all options for an appeal, as she attempts to ""seek redress against a giant media company that wields so much power.""
Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the newspaper welcomed the verdict, which like Rakoff's ruling recognized the importance of not punishing news media for unintended mistakes that are quickly corrected.
""It is gratifying that the jury and the judge understood the legal protections for the news media and our vital role in American society,"" she said.
DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH
Palin, 58, viewed the case in biblical terms, testifying on Feb. 10 that she considered herself the underdog to the Times' Goliath.
She sued the Times and its former editorial page editor James Bennet over a June 14, 2017, editorial that incorrectly linked her to a January 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that killed six people and wounded Democratic U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords.
It was written after a gunman opened fire at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, wounding several people including Republican U.S. congressman Steve Scalise.
The editorial referred to a map circulated by Palin's political action committee before the Arizona shooting that put the districts of Giffords and 19 other Democrats under cross hairs.
Bennet added to a colleague's draft that ""the link to political incitement was clear,"" though there was no evidence the map motivated the gunman.
The Times corrected the editorial the next morning after readers and one of its columnists complained.
Bennet testified that he did not intend to harm Palin and felt terrible about the mistake.
Bennet maintained that he added the language while under deadline pressure, thinking that the growth of ""highly charged political rhetoric"" could prompt such incidents.
Two conservative Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have called for the 1964 Sullivan decision to be reconsidered. There is no guarantee the high court will eventually take Palin's case. 

Palin, a prominent conservative, was the late Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election and served as Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.
She said the Times editorial left her feeling ""powerless"" and ""mortified,"" but during her testimony did not offer specific examples about how it hurt her reputation or caused her harm.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Tuesday, as signs of de-escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border sparked a risk-on session.
All three major indexes notched solid advances on the day, with market leading tech and tech-adjacent stocks providing the biggest boost and putting the Nasdaq, which gained 2.5%, out front.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index jumped 5.5% in its largest one-day percentage gain since March 2021.
Geopolitical heat was turned down a notch after Russia said it had withdrawn some of its troops near the Ukraine border, prompting bullish equities sentiment and causing crude prices to slide on easing supply concerns. [O/R] 
The announcement received guarded responses, and the United States and NATO said they had yet to see evidence of a drawdown.
Stocks briefly pared gains late in the session, when U.S. President Joe Biden said that while diplomatic efforts are ongoing.
""Nice rally today, thanks to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" said David Carter, managing director at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. 
""Markets have been moving based on Putin or (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell,"" Carter added. ""Putin and his intentions with Ukraine and Powell and his intentions regarding interest rates.""
The CBOE market volatility index backed down from a three-week high.
On the economic front, a report from the Labor Department showed producer prices surged in January at twice the expected rate, reinforcing economist expectations that the Federal Reserve will take on stubbornly persistent inflation by aggressively hiking key interest rates.
""Inflation data suggests prices are rising, but markets already knew this,"" Carter said.

""The market is now priced for a more aggressive Fed, and outside of geopolitics there’s reduced uncertainty,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""But the market is never certain so you always dealing probabilities."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 422.67 points, or 1.22%, to 34,988.84, the S&P 500 gained 69.4 points, or 1.58%, to 4,471.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 348.84 points, or 2.53%, to 14,139.76.
Nine of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed green, with tech shares enjoying the largest percentage gain, jumping 2.7%. Energy stocks, weighed by sliding crude prices, fell 1.4%.
Fourth quarter reporting season is entering its last stretch, with 370 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 78.1% have beaten analyst estimates, according to preliminary Refinitiv data.
""It's nice to have that earnings strength underlying these macro issues,"" Mayfield added.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index's surge followed  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s announcement of a $5.4 billion deal to buy Israeli chipmaker  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM).
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) rose 3.6% after the fast food operator beat quarterly profit and revenue estimates.
Hotelier Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) also beat Wall Street expectations due to rising occupancy rates, sending its shares up 5.8%.
Other travel-related companies surged, with the S&P 1500 airlines index and hotels/restaurants/leisure index rising 5.9% and 2.4%, respectively.
Shares of cloud infrastructure company  Arista Networks  (NYSE:ANET) jumped 5.8% after it forecast better-than-anticipated current quarter revenue.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 07:06PM ET</span>",U.S. oil producer EP Energy seeks to save deal from regulator -sources,"By David French and Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) - EP Energy is exploring a sale of oil-producing acreage in Utah it hopes will avert a challenge from a U.S. antitrust regulator to its agreed $1.5 billion takeover by private equity firm EnCap Investments LP, people familiar with the matter said.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has privately informed EP Energy and EnCap that it would sue to block their deal if they went ahead with it, the sources said. The regulator is concerned that EnCap - which owns XCL Resources, another Utah oil producer - would become too dominant a player in Utah's Uinta Basin, the sources added.
The FTC has rarely opposed oil and gas producer mergers, with the last challenge more than 20 years ago. It took the view that energy prices are driven by supply and demand worldwide rather than regional consolidation.
Its opposition to EP Energy's sale marks a potential change in stance and comes amid growing pressure on President Joe Biden's administration to respond to consumer angst over gasoline prices, which have soared 40% in the last year, U.S. Labor Department figures show.
EP Energy, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2020 and is owned by former creditors, has retained an investment bank to find a buyer for its Uinta assets, the sources said. One added the 155,000 net acres are likely worth in the high hundreds of millions of dollars.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. The FTC and EnCap declined comment. EP Energy and XCL did not respond to requests for comment.
EP Energy and XCL jointly accounted for about a third of the 92,000 barrels per day Uinta oil production in October, according to data provider Enverus. Rival Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) Inc also produced a third, with 16 others making up the rest.
In opposing the deal, the FTC has heeded concerns that refiners in Salt Lake City, which produce gasoline and other petroleum products for Utah and other Western states, could pay more to buy oil if competition from EP Energy is eliminated, the sources said.
The type of oil extracted from the Uinta is unlike any other crude grade found in the United States, with a waxy consistency and a high paraffin content, according to Utah's Department of Environmental Quality.
Local refiners acquire this crude at a discount to other blends, given lower transportation costs. Reduced competition could impede this dynamic, and reconfiguring facilities to process another type of oil is expensive and time-consuming.
There are five refineries in Salt Lake, owned by  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), HollyFrontier Corp, Silver Eagle Refining and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa)'s Big West Oil.
Chevron and Marathon declined comment. HollyFrontier, Silver Eagle and Big West did not respond to comment requests.
The Utah Petroleum Association (UPA) wrote to the FTC earlier this month to argue for EP Energy's sale to EnCap. The lobby group said the combined company will produce more oil to help drive down energy prices, thanks to efficient production techniques and lower costs, according to a copy of UPA's Feb. 1 letter seen by Reuters.
XCL and all five refiners are senior members, with EP Energy also in the group, according to UPA's website.
The UPA told Reuters it supports the transaction but has not had any direct interactions with the FTC, adding it could not speak to issues relating to individual members.
MORE SCRUTINY
The White House has already irked the oil and gas industry by making climate change a priority in its administrative agenda. It temporarily halted issuing new leases for drilling on federal land and proposed ending some fossil fuel subsidies. Energy companies argue these moves will increase energy costs.
The last major oil and gas producer merger challenged by the FTC was BP (NYSE:BP) Plc's $27 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co in 2000.
The FTC sued to block the deal and only agreed to drop its objections after BP offered to divest oil production acreage in Alaska. 
The White House has been vocal in its requests for the FTC to act as the reopening of economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic drives up energy consumption. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, wrote to FTC Chair Lina Khan in August asking her to investigate soaring energy prices. 
Khan responded that the FTC will scrutinize consolidation among gas station operators, but also look at energy industry dealmaking more broadly.
Last year, the FTC extended the approval process for at least five oil and gas mergers and acquisitions, including EP Energy-EnCap, Reuters has reported.

(Reuters) -Treasury Wine Estates said on Wednesday its operating earnings outside mainland China jumped 28%, underpinned by growth in its luxury and premium brands, sending shares of the world's largest standalone winemaker nearly 12% higher.
Treasury has had to re-direct supply to the United States, Europe and domestically after a diplomatic row between Canberra and Beijing effectively closed the lucrative Chinese market to Australian wine.
The company said it recorded strong growth in its Americas and premium brands businesses, both of which reported a 19% rise in their earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS).
""Penfolds growth was particularly strong in Asian markets outside of Mainland China ... increasing distribution in Asia, domestic markets, Europe and the United States was a key execution highlight,"" the company said in a statement.
Reported EBITS, excluding Australian COO wine sold in mainland China, rose to A$262.4 million ($187.7 million), narrowly missing market expectations of A$265 million while its total net profit slid 7.5% to A$109.1 million.
The company said trading conditions for the remainder of fiscal 2022 were expected to remain broadly in line with the first half across its key markets and channels.
""Despite FY22 potentially shaping up to be slightly softer than expectations, we see Treasury doing a commendable job building demand for its products in new markets,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
Treasury shares jumped as much as 11.8% to A$11.78 in early trading, while the broader market rose 0.4%.
The company said it plans to increase prices across select portfolio brands to partly mitigate the impact of elevated supply chain costs and logistics.

The Melbourne-based firm retained its interim dividend of 15 Australian cents per share.

The purchase was first announced in November 2020 but got delayed due to regulatory scrutiny including a full-scale investigation from the European Commission.
The probe came amid regulatory concerns on both sides of the Atlantic that a buying spree of startups by big firms may be so-called killer acquisitions aimed at closing down nascent rivals.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), secured EU approval after agreeing to provide rivals free access to its messaging channels for 10 years. 
Kustomer sells CRM software to businesses so they can communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram and other channels. Its takeover would help Facebook scale up its instant-messaging app WhatsApp, whose usage has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The FTC filed a lawsuit in April 2020, saying Altria's decision to buy a 35% stake in Juul, announced in December 2018, was bad for competition. The FTC said that the two companies were competitors in the market for closed-system e-cigarettes but that Altria opted to exit and invest in Juul.
The judge's decision may be reviewed by the FTC.
Murray Garnick, Altria executive vice president, said the company was ""pleased with this decision and have said all along that our minority investment in JUUL does not harm competition and does not violate the antitrust laws.""
The FTC declined to comment.

When Altria purchased its stake in Juul in more than three years ago, the investment was valued at $12.8 billion. But the deal has become a persistent headache for the tobacco firm, as Juul faced a regulatory crackdown over its popularity among teenagers. 
Altria has written down more than 85% of its original investment in Juul, and now values the company at $1.7 billion, according to a regulatory filing last month.

(Reuters) -Gaming platform Roblox Corp on Tuesday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly bookings as the pandemic-driven frenzy for its video games waned, sending its shares down more than 13% in extended trading.
Increased outdoor activities since the lifting of restrictions and reopening of schools in North America have affected user spending for pandemic winner Roblox, which is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children.
Roblox, which had its market debut last year, said during the fourth quarter average daily active users grew 33% to 49.5 million and gamers spent 10.8 billion hours on the platform, a 28% jump from last year. 
""Near term monetization results are disappointing for investors. However, user and engagement growth are strong. We expect numerous monetization levers to have impact going forward,"" said Brandon Ross, analyst at LightShed Partners.
Shares of San Mateo, California-based Roblox rose 5.5% since the company's market debut to close at $73.3 on Tuesday.
The company posted a 20% rise in fourth-quarter bookings to $770.1 million. Analysts had expected $772 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Bookings refer to Roblox's virtual currency ""Robux"" that players buy that can be used upgrade players' avatars by buying in-game items such as clothing, pet, collectibles or accessories.

Revenue, the amount of ""Robux"" spent by users that the company realizes over a longer period of time, increased 83% to $568.8 million.
Roblox reported a wider-than-expected loss of 25 cents per share compared with Wall Street estimates of 13 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 05:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive-ViacomCBS's Paramount+ 'thinks local' to go global with streaming,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - When the reality series “The Challenge: War of the Worlds” launches on four continents in June, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc aims to test a key component of its streaming strategy - using localized content on broadcast TV to attract subscribers to its Paramount+ streaming service, an executive with the entertainment conglomerate told Reuters. 
The media giant is launching four versions of the show and airing them on its broadcast TV networks in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Argentina, and streaming episodes on Paramount+ globally the following day, Chris McCarthy, chief content officer for unscripted entertainment and adult animation at Paramount+, said in an interview ahead of his presentation to investors on Tuesday. 
Contestants will be reality TV stars from those countries, and the winner from each version will compete in a ten-episode “War of the Worlds” that will air on Paramount+ globally beginning in August. The series is a spinoff of a show that has aired on ViacomCBS-owned MTV for 38 seasons. 
ViacomCBS is betting that inexpensive content that can be localized for different markets will help it compete in a global challenge of its own: the race by U.S. streaming services to claim subscribers outside the United States, a market that is becoming more important as streaming services mature. 
Production costs for unscripted television are only 10% to 30% those of a scripted series, and the shows are easier to localize for global markets, according to McCarthy. Streaming rivals including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) have been pushing into the genre in recent years.
To further reduce costs, ViacomCBS will produce all four international versions of “War of the Worlds” - in which contestants vie for prize money through a series of puzzles and physical challenges - and the final global competition at the same location in Argentina. Production costs are two-thirds what they would be if each of the four broadcast channels produced them independently, McCarthy said. 
Reality competition helps to retain viewers who subscribe to the service for live sports, he added. 
“Live sports and reality competition are really the same viewer,” McCarthy said. “And when we look at the average cost of that same consumer, it's much lower when we put those two things together.”
ViacomCBS has plans to launch Paramount+ in 45 markets by the end of 2022, and is playing catch-up to rivals. 
As of Nov. 17, Paramount+ and Showtime OTT had 48 million global subscribers. AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc-owned HBO and HBO Max had a combined 73.8 million subscribers at the end of 2021; Netflix has 221.8 million subscribers and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ has 129.8 million subscribers, according to the companies. 
Paramount has committed $2 billion to streaming content this year and $5 billion by 2024 - a figure dwarfed by the investments of Netflix and Disney+ but in line with Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s plans for U.S. content spend for its Peacock streaming service over the next couple of years. 
MORE ‘SHORE’
Reality TV is a staple at ViacomCBS, three decades after its MTV cable network created the genre with “The Real World.” “The Challenge” was a “Real World” spinoff that was originally called “The Real World/Road Rules Challenge.” New seasons still premiere on MTV before moving to Paramount+, even though the latest spinoff – “The Challenge: War of the Worlds” – will not air on cable.
If the strategy for “The Challenge: War of the Worlds” is successful, McCarthy said, ViacomCBS is likely to replicate it with the majority of its competition series, such as the tattoo artist show “Ink Master” or the drag queen competition “Queen of the Universe.” 
Within the genre of unscripted television, competition series like “The Challenge” do the best job of driving subscribers in mature markets like the United States and Australia, said McCarthy.
In emerging markets like Mexico, where “telenovela” soap operas are still popular on broadcast TV, “docu-reality” series such as “Jersey Shore” and its spinoffs including “Acapulco Shore” perform well on broadcast TV, cable and streaming.
The strength of “docu-reality” in emerging markets is why ViacomCBS is launching seven new global versions of its “Shore” franchise on Paramount+ in Argentina, Columbia, Croatia and other markets.

An episode in the “Shore” franchise costs between $100,000 and $300,000, said McCarthy, compared with $2.5 million to $10 million an episode for a scripted show, on average. 
“If you get one really, really successful unscripted that's a runaway hit, the economics of that are going to be massive because production costs are so low,” said CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday welcomed an upcoming vote by workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery on a new contract offer, saying its terms ensure the refinery can stay profitable over the long-term. 
Nearly 600 workers represented by the United Steelworkers union were locked out of the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and adjoining lubrication plant last May 1 and have been without paychecks. 
""We are pleased that our represented employees will have another chance to vote,"" said Exxon spokesperson Julie King. ""Our offer provides long-term stability, including job protections and wage progressions for employees."" 
A USW official said the union is withholding recommendations on the proposal but wants members to decide on the twice-sweetened offer. A membership vote is scheduled for Feb. 21. 
USW Local 13-243 said in a statement it would ""continue to hold Exxon Mobil management accountable and pursue our charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) over the company's serious unfair labor practices."" 
The proposal would give Exxon new control over job assignments, something it has sought as part of an expansion at the refinery. The expansion would make Beaumont its largest by oil-processing capacity in the United States. 
Exxon has said the changes in job seniority were necessary so it could be competitive even in low-margin environments.
The workers rejected a similar contract proposal in October. 

The new offer makes Martin Luther King Day a paid holiday, clarifies language about a union committee, and provides a job description for operators in the lubrication oil plant, Exxon has said. 
Still to be determined is whether the USW will continue to represent the plant's workers. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held a vote on decertifying the union late last year. Results of that vote have been withheld while the NLRB reviews USW unfair labor practice charges alleging Exxon began the lockout to force the union's removal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of U.S. Senate Republicans introduced on Tuesday their own legislation to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia over a military build-up near Ukraine's borders, after weeks of talks on a bipartisan bill hit a stalemate.
Introduction of the measure, called the Never Yielding Europe's Territory (NYET) Act, does not mean that negotiations have stopped between Republicans and Democrats on a bipartisan Ukraine bill, a senior Republican aide said.
The path forward is not immediately clear for the measure, given Democratic control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The bill would immediately halt construction of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and impose mandatory sanctions on the project if Russia invaded Ukraine.
It also would impose sanctions on major Russian banks if there were an invasion and secondary sanctions on banks that did business with sanctioned banks.
Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the Republican measure as ""partisan posturing.""
""The latest proposal by Republicans is largely a reflection of what Democrats had already agreed to in our ongoing conversations, building off of the 'mother of all sanctions' we initially proposed,"" Menendez said in a statement. 
Reflecting the partisan inability to agree on a bill, even amid fears of war in Europe, Senate leaders on Tuesday issued a ""statement"" - which falls short of binding legislation - saying the Senate stands in solidarity with Ukraine and supports sanctions on Russia.
Disagreement over how to handle Nord Stream 2 - which would take gas direct to Germany from Russia, bypassing Ukraine - and secondary sanctions on banks had been two major obstacles to writing a bipartisan bill.
Senators from both parties have said they want to act quickly to help Ukraine, with sanctions on Russia and more military assistance for Kyiv, in what had seemed to be a rare incidence of bipartisan cooperation in a bitterly divided Congress. 
A group of about five Democrats and five Republican Senators had been involved in talks on a bill for weeks, but failed to reach an agreement.

The NYET Act was co-sponsored by more than 30 of the 50 Senate Republicans, led by Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has been heavily involved in talks on a bipartisan plan.
A similar bill was introduced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House of Representatives.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Stocks on Wall Street and in Europe rebounded on Tuesday while oil prices fell after Russia indicated it was withdrawing some troops from exercises near Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin said he saw room for further discussion with the West.
President Joe Biden later said a Russian attack on Ukraine remained possible and that the United States would defend every inch of NATO territory.
Gold and bond prices slid as safe-haven assets lost some of their appeal with tensions possibly easing over Ukraine. But NATO said it had yet to see any evidence of de-escalation and a vote in Russia's lower house threatened a wider standoff.
The State Duma agreed to ask Putin to recognize two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent, a move the European Union told Moscow not to adopt.
The dollar index pared losses as Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke, a sign tensions over Ukraine have not been resolved. But the index fell 0.294%, suggesting there was little flight to safety, especially as the euro, which had weakened recently, rose 0.44% to $1.1355.
The Russian ruble strengthened 1.53% at 75.51 per dollar.
""In the back of everybody's minds this is not going away. Putin might be saying one thing and just waiting for the right time to make a move,"" said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings. 
Major stock indices rose on both sides of the Atlantic, with megacap growth and tech stocks leading the rally on Wall Street. The major European bourses posted gains of more than 1%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.43% after falling three consecutive sessions, while MSCI's U.S.-centric gauge of global equities closed up 1.34%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.22%, the S&P 500 added 1.58% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.53%.
While the Ukraine crisis simmered, the Labor Department reported U.S. producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January, a reminder that high inflation could persist through much of this year.
The Federal Reserve is aware inflation is running hot but knows rising home prices and mortgage rates will crimp the pocket book of many Americans, leading the economy and inflation to slow, said Peter Cramer, senior managing director at SLC Management.
""They know they have to get inflation under control, but the slowing of economic activity that will really help do that is already starting to happen,"" Cramer said.
A closely watched part of the yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, is starting to signal a sharp slowdown, as it flattens to 47.1 basis points.
The odds of the Fed engineering a recession are increasing if policymakers do not push back against a market narrative of six or so interest rate hikes in a row, Cramer said.
It remains to be seen whether the Fed can get inflation under control by raising interest rates alone, di Galoma said. 
Markets are pricing in a 65.5% chance of a 50-basis-point hike and a 34.5% chance of a 25-bps hike at the U.S. central bank's March meeting.
Longer-dated U.S. Treasury and euro zone bond yields rose, as investors took comfort from the potential easing of tensions over Ukraine and essentially ignored the PPI data. 
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5.6 basis points to 2.052%. Germany's 10-year yield touched its highest since 2018 on the day's possible easing of Russia-Ukraine tensions.
Oil prices tumbled more than 3% as they retreated from a seven-year high.
U.S. crude futures fell $3.39 to settle at $92.07 a barrel, while Brent futures settled down $3.20 at $93.28 a barrel.
Precious metals also fell, with gold slipping from a multi-month high and palladium shedding more than 5%.

U.S. gold futures settled down 0.7% at $1,856.20 an ounce.
Bitcoin rose 4.33% to $44,066.83 in another sign of the risk-on mood in markets.

The company reported EPS of 8 cents on revenue of $1.53 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $1.46 billion.
The beat was driven by a rebound in it bookings for nights and experiences compared with a year ago, when pandemic-fueled travel restrictions were more widespread.  
""Airbnb saw continued strength in nights and experiences booked in North America, EMEA and Latin America, all of which have driven significant year-over-year growth,"" the company said.
Gross booking value increased 91% to $11.3 billion year-on-year, while average daily rates averaged approximately $154 in Q4 2021, representing a 20% increase from the same prior year period, and a 36% increase compared to the same period in 2019
Looking ahead to Q1, the company touted a further upswing in growth amid pent-up demand following omicron-led restrictions.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc lifted a mask mandate for fully vaccinated employees at some U.S. facilities on Tuesday, but those at meatpacking plants must continue wearing masks for now.
The meat processor joins major employers like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in relaxing mask requirements.
Tyson said its policy applies to employees at facilities not inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The agency inspects meatpacking plants, a hot spot for COVID-19 outbreaks early in the pandemic.
Employees at corporate offices, distribution centers, feed mills and some production facilities inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can go maskless if state and local laws allow it, Tyson spokesman Derek Burleson said.
The company will work with the USDA to potentially extend the policy to workers in meatpacking plants who are not in contact with government inspectors, Burleson said. He added that the policy does not yet impact most Tyson employees.
""We're definitely working with USDA on what this might look like at each of our FSIS-inspected facilities,"" Burleson said. ""We're working to try to expand this to more facilities.""
The USDA requires plant workers to wear masks when federal inspectors are present at facilities in geographic areas with ""substantial"" or ""high"" community COVID-19 transmission. An agency spokesman had no immediate comment on Tyson.
Tyson said it is easing mask mandates because of lower infection rates and ""extremely low rates of serious illness"" among employees. The company last year required workers to be vaccinated.

COVID-19 hit the U.S. meatpacking industry hard at the start of the pandemic, when thousands of worker infections temporarily shut slaughterhouses. In January, rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant again forced plants to slow production.
Tyson said it will continue to provide masks for employees who chose to wear them and watch for new coronavirus variants. The company has said it spent $810 million on preventive COVID-19 measures.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Tuesday, as signs of easing Russia-Ukraine tensions gave investors the green light to buy the recent dip in stocks, with tech stocks leading the charge.
The S&P 500 rose 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%, or 422 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8%.
President Vladimir Putin said Russia was “of course” not looking to go war with Ukraine, and pointed to proposals laid out by Moscow as a basis for finding a diplomatic resolution to Ukraine's security crisis.
""Do we want this or not? Of course, not. That is exactly why we put forward proposals for a process of negotiations,"" Putin said in response to a question on whether Russia wanted a war in Europe.
Putin has demanded the U.S. and its allies provide guarantees that Ukraine won’t be allowed to join the NATO military alliance, which he has flagged as a threat to Russia.
U.S. President Biden said, however, that a Russian attack on Ukraine was still very much a possibility, and reiterated that neither the U.S. nor NATO were a threat to Russia. 
""The United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia, "" Biden said. ""Neither the US nor NATO have missiles in Ukraine. We do not do not have plans to put them there as well.""
Easing Russia-Ukraine tensions restored investor risk appetite, with tech, in particular chips stocks, in high demand.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) jumped more than 5%, led by 9% rally in the NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) ahead of its quarterly results due Wednesday.
The chipmaker’s gaming and data center businesses are expected to help it deliver “a significant beat and raise,”  Piper Sandler said in a note, according to Barons
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were also in the ascendency.
Facebook agreed to pay $90 million to settle a years-long privacy lawsuit that alleged the social media giant kept tabs on users' internet activity even after they logged out their social media accounts.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, ended in the red, pressured by a plunge in oil prices on deescalating geopolitical tensions.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), and Diamondback Energy  (NASDAQ:FANG) led the declines in the sector.
The return of risk-on sentiment to Wall Street prompted investors to sell U.S. Treasuries, sending yields higher just as data showed further signs of inflation pressures.
The producer price index rose by a more than expected 1.0% in January, following a 0.3% gain in December. The year-on-year pace of producer prices rose 9.7% in January, the largest gain on records dating back to 2010.
The inflation report arrives a day ahead of the Federal Reserve’s minutes for the January meeting that could provide insights into the central bank’s thinking on tightening monetary policy.
The odds of a 50% rate hike at the Fed’s meeting next stood at about 61% versus 27.9% a week ago, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. lawmakers asked the Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General to review the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) oversight over  Boeing Co 's actions surrounding the 737 MAX jet.
The chair of the House of Representatives Transportation Committee, Peter DeFazio, and Rick Larsen, who chairs a subcommittee on aviation, said the request came after the FAA failed to provide an adequate response to a November letter seeking answers about Boeing actions before two Boeing 737 MAX crashes in five months that killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month grounding.
Boeing declined to comment. The FAA did not immediately comment.
Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January 2021, including the payment of $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes. Last week, the Justice Department defended the agreement over objections from some victims' relatives.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a Jan. 24 letter made public Tuesday that because of the Justice Department investigation and work by other reviews, the ""FAA did not pursue investigations or actions against individuals within the Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).""
The lawmakers in November had asked the FAA what it had done, if anything, to hold Boeing employees responsible for actions in connection with the MAX.
In October, a former Boeing chief technical pilot was charged with fraud for allegedly deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. The pilot has pleaded not guilty.
DeFazio has questioned the focus on a single technical pilot, saying in October, ""Senior leaders throughout Boeing are responsible for the culture of concealment that ultimately led to the 737 MAX crashes and the death of 346 innocent people.""

The lawmakers cited Boeing's apparent violation of its approved 737 MAX type design, as well as evidence of an internal plan to downplay the significance of a key safety system called MCAS tied to both fatal crashes.
The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes.

Investing.com -- General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) said it will begin producing Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles again in early April after the factory was closed for eight months due to battery fire recalls.
GM shares are up 2.3% Tuesday. 
The company explained that battery supplier LG Energy Solution is now producing enough to provide replacement modules for the recalls and to resume production.
GM had previously recalled more than 140,000 Bolts worldwide due to battery manufacturing defects that could cause the vehicles to catch fire. The faulty batteries were said to have had two flaws, forcing GM to recall Bolt models sold between 2016 and 2021.
The Detroit, Michigan-based company will start making hatchback and SUV versions of the vehicle, which should start reaching dealers shortly after. Meanwhile, unsold vehicles with dealers can be sold once the battery modules are replaced.
In October, LG agreed to reimburse GM $2 billion for the recall costs. In addition, the companies will continue the joint venturer to build batteries for electric vehicles.
In late January, GM said it will invest more than $7 billion in four Michigan manufacturing sites, including the construction of a new Ultium Cells battery cell plant with LG Energy in Lansing.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ericsson said on Tuesday an internal investigation in 2019 found serious breaches of its compliance rules in Iraq, including evidence of corruption-related misconduct and improper use of sales agents and consultants. 
The Swedish telecom equipment group said it was working with external counsel to review the findings resulting from the investigation to identify any additional measures that it should take. 
The probe, which was triggered by unusual expense claims in Iraq dating back to 2018, finished a year later but the company chose not to disclose it at that time. 
But Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said as a result of media inquiries, it was reviewing its investigation and would compare with information presented by media. 
""The materiality of our findings did not pass our threshold to make a disclosure,"" Chief Executive Officer Börje Ekholm told Reuters. ""That was our judgment when we completed the investigation two years ago."" 
Ericsson said the investigation resulted in several employees exiting the company, other remedial actions being taken, and termination of a number of third-party relationships.
The company said the internal investigating team had identified payments to intermediaries and the use of alternate transport routes in connection with circumventing Iraqi Customs, at a time when militant organisations, including Islamic State, controlled some transport routes. 
The investigators could not determine the ultimate recipients of these payments or identify that any Ericsson employee was directly involved in financing such organisations, the company said in a statement. 
""We invested significant resources to complete the investigation, but as a company we have limited powers to investigate,"" Ekholm said. ""We tried to do the best we could, took guidance from external legal counsel and other external support."" 
In 2019, Ericsson had agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to pay more than $1 billion to resolve a different series of probes into corruption, including the bribing of government officials that took place over many years in countries including China, Vietnam and Djibouti. 
In October last year, it received correspondence from DoJ stating that the company breached its obligations under a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) by failing to provide certain documents and factual information.
When asked if Ericsson had disclosed its 2019 internal investigation to the DoJ, Ekholm said: ""We are under the DPA with the U.S. authorities which limits our ability to comment on what is disclosed or not disclosed."" 

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
""If new facts come to light or new information, we will for sure reopen the investigation and run it full speed ahead to investigate those matters,"" Ekholm said.

Madison Dearborn will acquire MoneyGram for $11 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion. The price represents a premium of roughly 50% to MoneyGram's closing stock price on Monday, the last trading day before talk of a possible transaction.
In addition, once the transaction has been completed, Madison Dearborn will refinance the company's outstanding debt, which stood at $799 million at the end of December.
The agreement includes a 30-day ""go-shop"" period, which means MoneyGram is permitted to initiate, solicit, encourage and evaluate other acquisition proposals. In addition, the company will have the right to terminate the Madison Dearborn agreement to enter into a superior proposal.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
""We are excited to enter into this transaction with MDP, which will deliver immediate and compelling value to shareholders and enable us to accelerate the advancement of our digital growth strategy,"" said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram chairman, and CEO.

(Reuters) - Vaccinating pregnant women against the coronavirus may help prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations in infants after they are born, especially if the expecting mothers got the shots later in their pregnancy, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday. 
The findings shed light on whether the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy extend to infants who would be too young to receive vaccines. 
Researchers from several pediatric hospitals and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at children under six months old between July 2021 and January 2022. 
The study analyzed data from 379 hospitalized infants - 176 with COVID-19 and 203 who were admitted for other issues. It found that COVID-19 vaccines were 61% effective overall at preventing hospitalizations in children whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy. 
That protection rose to 80% when the mothers were vaccinated 21 weeks through 14 days before delivery. Vaccination effectiveness fell to 32% for the babies whose mothers were inoculated earlier during pregnancy. 
The study authors warned that the estimates for effectiveness earlier in pregnancy should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.
“Right now we want to ensure that we are protecting both the mom and the infant,"" CDC's Dana Meaney-Delman told reporters. ""So as soon as a pregnant woman is willing to be vaccinated, she should so ahead and do so.""
Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and having COVID during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and possibly other pregnancy complications, according to the CDC.

The CDC recommends that women who are pregnant, are breastfeeding, are trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future get vaccinated and stay up to date with COVID-19 shots. 
Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with preterm delivery or underweight newborns.

PARIS (Reuters) - France is grouping the country's top cybersecurity experts in Paris' business district of La Defense, bringing together startups and household names to tackle the scourge of hacking, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday. 
Cyberattacks have become the number one worry of the world's top company executives, according to a survey by PwC, and their growing number and sophistication could undermine the country's sovereignty, French leaders say. 
""France ... doesn't want to depend on foreigners,"" Le Maire said at the inauguration of the venue. ""It wants to be independent in advanced technologies.""
The project has drawn inspiration from a similar set up in Israel, CyberSpark, which has served as a model for Michel Van Den Berghe, the head of France's Campus Cyber.
The campus will be a base for cyber startups and experts from some of country's biggest listed companies such as LVMH, L'Oreal and largest banks. 

""For a startup, to be in the same building as the biggest companies that could put their solutions in their catalogue, it's a great accelerator,"" Van Den Berghe said. 
Campus Cyber can host 1,800 people. It is run by a company that is 44% owned and funded by the French state, with the rest of the capital divided among about 90 organisations, including country's leading companies in the field: Orange, defence company Thales, software maker Sopra Steria and IT consulting firms Atos and Capgemini.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vehicles on U.S. roads will now be allowed to use advanced headlights known as ""adaptive driving beams"" that could help prevent nighttime crashes, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday.
The agency acted in response to a petition filed by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp in 2013 to allow the lights. They automatically adjust the beams using additional sensors so they can provide more illumination without a glare to oncoming motorists.
The headlights have been permitted in Europe for more than a decade and are also allowed in Japan, Canada and other countries. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and BMW AG also later filed petitions to use the lights on U.S. vehicles.
The lights ran afoul of U.S. rules setting maximum levels for lower beams. An infrastructure law signed in November requires NHTSA to issue a final rule by late 2023 allowing advanced headlight use.
NHTSA said the rule ""will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists by making them more visible at night, and will help prevent crashes by better illuminating animals and objects in and along the road.""
U.S. pedestrian deaths are up 45% since 2010. In 2020, there were 6,236 pedestrian deaths --- about 1 in 6 traffic deaths. NHTSA’s data shows about 72% of pedestrian fatalities and 51% of driver fatalities occur at night despite accounting for just 25% of vehicle miles traveled.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly all major automakers, said research shows the headlights ""can help provide enhanced down-road visibility without increasing glare to oncoming vehicles.""

Unlike some automatic headlight switch systems from high to low beams, adaptive headlights use sensors, cameras, data-processing software, and headlamp hardware to detect oncoming and preceding vehicles and automatically adjust the beams.
NHTSA has received thousands of complaints about headlight glare over the last four decades, especially with the introduction of halogen lights in the late 1970s and then high-intensity discharge lights in the 1990s.

(Reuters) -Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc said on Tuesday that it stripped its most famous sandwich, the Whopper, from discount menus and will raise menu prices again this year as to offset higher costs.
U.S.-listed shares of the company rose more than 3% after it topped results estimates for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, led by soaring online sales and better-than-expected same-store sales growth at Burger King in the United States and Tim Hortons in Canada.
Restaurant chains are raising prices because they are paying higher costs for shipping, labor, and commodities including chicken, coffee and cooking oils amid COVID-19 related disruptions.
The record inflation levels and staffing disruptions due to the omicron variant dulled profits at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and coffeehouse chain  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). 
Burger King's Whopper - made from a quarter pound of grilled beef - is an ""iconic"" product that has ""been on this core discount platform for too long,"" Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Officer Jose Cil told Reuters in an interview.
The chain, which often caters to lower-income customers, removed the item from its two for $5 deal but could offer limited discounts on the burger in the future.
Burger King also said it would stop selling some less-popular menu items altogether, including sundaes, whipped toppings and chocolate milk.
Cil declined to provide timelines for overall price hikes in 2022.
Toronto, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands reported total revenue of $1.55 billion, above estimates of $1.52 billion.
But U.S. comparable sales fell at Popeyes, in part because some locations have had to reduce operations by an average of one hour due to staffing shortages.

Popeyes' sales had been soaring even through much of the pandemic after the 2019 launch of its fried chicken sandwich, which was so popular that most rivals - including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc's KFC - introduced their own similar product.
Restaurant Brands reported per share earnings of 74 cents in the fourth quarter, topping Refinitiv estimates of 69 cents.

Capuano added that new bookings across customer segments had rebounded to pre-Omicron levels despite a setback in January, and that he was optimistic about global travel demand recovery throughout 2022.

Occupancy in the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton owner's key U.S. and Canada region stood at 60% in the fourth quarter, compared with 35.1% a year earlier. 
The company reported quarterly adjusted net income per share of $1.30, topping analyst estimates of $1.00 per share.

(Reuters) -The Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co has appointed an executive to oversee its metaverse strategy, according to an email Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek sent to staff Tuesday and seen by Reuters.
Mike White, an executive in the Media and Entertainment Distribution group, has been named to the new role of senior vice president of Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences, where he will help define how consumers experience Disney's coming metaverse. He will work alongside Disney's creative teams.
""For nearly 100 years, our company has defined and re-defined entertainment by leveraging technology to bring stories to life in deeper, more impactful ways,"" Chapek wrote in the email to staff, adding, ""Today, we have an opportunity to connect those universes and create an entirely new paradigm for how audiences experience and engage with our stories.""
Chapek announced last November that Disney is poised to embark on journey to the metaverse, which he said would advance storytelling by combining elements of the physical and digital world. He describes the metaverse as the ""next great storytelling frontier"" and part of the company's strategic priorities.

White has 25 years of technology and leadership experience. Before joining Disney in 2011, he served as chief technology officer for Apollo Group and earlier spent a decade at Yahoo, holding positions of increasing responsibility, including director of strategy and technology. He will be charged with putting in place a process to prioritize how to allocate resources and is expected to create a task force that will include leaders across the company.

Sachem Head, which owns 8.7% of the company, called the nominations ""the last option available"" to protect stockholder interests after US Foods failed to make operational improvements and lift margins.
In response, US Foods said it profitably grew market share and expanded core earnings margins in the four years leading up to the pandemic and has since invested roughly $60 million to hire more people.
In a letter to other shareholders, Sachem Head portfolio manager Scott Ferguson said new directors are needed to hold current or future management accountable. 
""There is a deep-seated resistance to real change at US Foods, and, in fact, a lack of acknowledgement that there is even a problem,"" Ferguson said.
He nominated himself and six others with expertise in supply chain issues, the food industry as well as strategic and financial issues to the 11-member board. The slate includes Bernardo Hees, former chief executive of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co. 
US Foods, however, said the board still had concerns about Hees' previous leadership roles.
It said Brazilian regulators had investigated Hees as the former CEO of America Latina Logistica (ALL) over financial irregularities, while Kraft Heinz had to pay a $62 million penalty after U.S. authorities found out it falsified supplier contracts to achieve cost savings during his tenure.
Sachem Head earlier walked away from a proposed settlement that would have handed it a board seat and allowed it to help select another director. The hedge fund has been invested in US Foods since 2018.

US Foods, valued at $8.3 billion, last week said it split the role of chairman and chief executive officer, a step that often appeals to big investors like pension funds who would eventually vote in proxy fights.
Private equity firm KKR owns roughly 10% of the company and has a board seat too.

Investing.com -- Iqvia Holdings Inc (NYSE:IQV) shares are down over 5% Tuesday, despite the company reporting its fourth-quarter numbers that beat analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue.
Iqvia, formerly Quintiles and IMS Health, provides advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry. 
The company announced earnings per share of $2.55 on revenue of $3.64 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com predicted EPS of $2.43 on revenue of $3.59 billion. Revenue for the quarter grew 10.2% year-over-year, driven by a 15% rise in its research & development solutions unit. 
The company sees first quarter 2022 revenue between $3.51 billion and $3.57 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6%, with earnings per share for the quarter between $2.40 and $2.46, representing a 7.5% to 9.5% increase.
For the full year of 2022, Iqvia reaffirmed the revenue guidance range of $14.7 billion to $15 billion provided at its Analyst and Investor Conference in November. The company said this is despite a $70 million revenue headwind from foreign currency exchange rates changes. As a result, adjusted earnings per share for 2022 is expected to be between $9.95 and $10.25.
""We closed 2021 with an impressive quarter, delivering robust growth across all key financial metrics versus what was a strong fourth quarter of 2020,"" said Ari Bousbib, chairman and CEO of IQVIA. 
""We had a record year of net new business in R&DS, strong double-digit revenue growth for the year in both our R&DS and TAS segments, and a record year of free cash flow generation. We are now two-thirds of the way through our Vision 22 plan and are on a path to achieving or exceeding our targets,"" he added.
After initially opening up the session higher at $245.01 per share, Iqvia is now down more than 5%. However, Stifel responded to the decline, saying that despite ""very strong earnings numbers and a strong outlook"" the decline may be due to volatility concerns in emerging biopharma funding due to a competitor's recent issues. According to TheFly, the analyst said he would be buying Iqvia shares on today's dip."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Intel Corp is buying Israeli chipmaker  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) for $5.4 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, giving it access to more specialised production as it positions to take advantage of soaring semiconductor demand.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is paying $53 per share for Tower - which specialises in analogue chips used in cars, medical sensors and power management - well above Monday's closing price of $33.13.
Tower's shares jumped 42% in early trade in New York on Tuesday to $47.03, after surging in after-hours trade on Monday on news of a possible takeover. Tower had a market value of $3.6 billion before the news. Intel shares were up over 1% by midday on Tuesday. 
The acquisition deepens Intel's presence in a sector dominated by Taiwan-based TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker, at a time when the global semiconductor shortage has hampered the production of everything from smartphones to cars.
""We think this makes a lot of sense. (Tower) is a foundry for trailing edge process technology that is likely to be tight for the next several years,"" said Northland Capital Markets' analyst Gus Richard.
A foundry business produces chips that customers design, and Intel announced last year it would enter that business. Analysts had said at the time that a lack of deal targets could be a challenge. 
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said Intel and Tower's technologies were complementary, with the foundry market at $100 billion and expected to grow sharply over the rest of the decade.
Chips produced by Intel account for about 70% of this market, which includes mobile and automotive, he said, adding that the other 30% was served by companies like Tower.
CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said the deal will help Intel acquire talent to develop its foundry business. ""However, by the time (Intel) gets this business going, supply constraints will no longer be an issue and both TSMC and Samsung (KS:005930) are both aggressively ramping up capacity in the next five years,"" he noted.
Tower has been investing in Israel, Texas and Japan to boost capacity for 200 and 300 millimetre chips. It serves ""fabless"" companies - which design chips but outsource manufacturing - and integrated device manufacturers. Tower, previously known as TowerJazz, has capacity for more than 2 million wafer starts a year.
Tower CEO Russell Elwanger said he expected to continue to have good relations with customers in China.
Tower's power management chips draw ""extraordinary interest from customers but (Tower) simply don't have the scale to meet the market demands,"" Gelsinger told a conference call.
Tower's factories make chips using legacy nodes.
Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, however said that ""To be a meaningful long-term foundry player, Intel needs to be in the advanced process node"" rather than legacy nodes.
RESTORING DOMINANCE
The transaction, expected to close in about 12 months, is still subject to regulatory approvals, which Gelsinger expected to be smooth. It also needs approval from Tower’s shareholders.
Intel said last month it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio. The move is aimed at restoring Intel's dominance in chip-making and reducing America's reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs.
The U.S. chipmaker has had a large presence in Israel for nearly 50 years, with five sites. In 2017 it bought Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye (F:0ME) for $15.3 billion.
It is spending $10 billion on a new chip plant in Israel with 6,000 employees and another $600 million to expand its research and development (R&D) in the country.

Intel said it aims to fund the takeover of Tower with cash from its balance sheet. Once the deal is completed, Tower will be integrated into Intel Foundry Services (IFS), which Intel established a year ago.
Tower will issue its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2021 financial results on Thursday, but will not issue first-quarter guidance because of the deal, the companies said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on Tuesday vowed to improve coordination on spectrum management after a 5G aviation dispute threatened flights.
The agencies said they will work cooperatively to resolve spectrum policy issues and will hold formal, regular meetings to conduct joint spectrum planning. Earlier this month, lawmakers blasted the FCC and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for failing to avoid an embarrassing last-minute standoff between the aviation and wireless industries.
The FCC and NTIA will update a memorandum of understanding to ""address gaps in government coordination.""
The agencies vowed to ""recommit to scientific integrity and evidence-based policymaking and ""foster proactive technical exchange and engagement with industry and other federal agencies by participating in cross-agency advisory groups.""
New NTIA head Alan Davison will testify https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20220216/114417/HHRG-117-IF16-Bio-DavidsonA-20220216-U1.pdf on Wednesday before a House subcommittee, pledging ""a coordinated, national approach to spectrum use.""
The FAA had warned that 5G interference could impact sensitive airplane electronics such as radio altimeters
The rollout took place on Jan. 19, but only after  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying about 510 5G wireless towers near airports.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson testified that federal agencies need to improve their coordination because there will be future spectrum issues.
""The process did not serve anyone well,"" Dickson told lawmakers. ""We certainly need to do better as a country.""
Acting NTIA head Adam Candeub in late 2020 declined to submit FAA concerns to the FCC. Candeub said in an op-ed https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/593801-bidens-faa-must-learn-to-work-with-others-in-order-to-quickly that the ""FAA’s letter forwarded no new or convincing scientific evidence or concerns which the FCC had not already reviewed.""
Airlines CEOs on Jan. 17 warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of 5G.

Verizon and AT&T's deployment delay did not prevent dozens of foreign carriers from canceling international flights to the United States.
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said last month, ""As we use more of our wireless airways for commercial activity we are going to have to engage in more coordination early and often.""

Investing.com – Zoetis stock (NYSE:ZTS) rose 1.5% Tuesday after the animal health company said 2022 revenue could grow as much as 9%, pinning its hopes on strength in petcare and expansion of its diagnostics portfolio internationally.
The company expects significant growth in both livestock and companion animal product sales in emerging markets, including China and Brazil.
Zoetis is projecting its current-year revenue to come in between $8.32 billion and $8.47 billion. Adjusted profit per share is seen at $5.15 at midpoint of its guidance range.
The company’s outlook comes in after fourth-quarter revenue grew 9% to $2 billion, with sales in U.S. accounting for just over half of it.
Sales of companion animal products in U.S. were up 20%, driven by growth across the parasiticides portfolio, including Simparica Trio for dogs, a once-a-month chewable.
Sales of cattle products declined in U.S. because of lower-priced generic products and continued weakness in beef and dairy markets. Generic competition was also felt in the company’s poultry portfolio. Sales of swine products fell due to pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccines.
In the international markets, swine products sales fell in the quarter as a result of declining pork prices because of increased supply in China.
The company said its first injectable monoclonal antibody to control pain due to osteoarthritis in cats has got approvals in U.S., the EU, the U.K., Canada and Switzerland.
In the recent quarter, Zoetis launched new digital and data analytic solutions to help its U.S. cattle producer customers improve the productivity of their farms and ranches. It has also developed a new Cloud-based management software to help cow-calf producers track and manage herd inventory.
Zoetis’ adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was $1 and beat estimates."

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian internet giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) on Tuesday reported a sharp drop in adjusted annual net profit, but said total revenue could surge this year to around $6.5 billion, driven in part by high turnover growth in e-commerce. 
Yandex's core advertising business, which accounted for 47% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021, suffered during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but surging interest in online transactions allowed its other businesses to flourish.
Revenue, which the company expects to reach 490 billion-500 billion roubles ($6.50 billion-$6.63 billion) in 2022, jumped 54% last year to 356.2 billion roubles compared to 2020, above company guidance of 340 billion-350 billion roubles.
Yandex's adjusted net income stood at 8 billion roubles in 2021, down 55% on a like-for-like basis including its loss-making Yandex.Market e-commerce venture. 
Investments in high-growth segments, such as e-commerce and media services, curbed profit last year, Yandex said. 
It expects its total e-commerce gross merchandise volume (GMV) to double in 2022, while GMV in its taxi segment, which includes ride-hailing and car-sharing, should reach 700 billion-720 billion roubles this year.
Yandex spent $600 million on e-commerce initiatives in 2021, $50 million less than its guidance, which CFO Svetlana Demyashkevich said was evidence of disciplined capital allocation. 
She said Yandex finished the year with $1.4 billion in cash after paying $1 billion to buy Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s stakes in their joint foodtech, delivery and self-driving businesses.
""We remain well capitalized to fund our planned strategic investments,"" she said. 
Yandex.Market registered a full-year loss of 40.5 billion roubles in adjusted EBITDA, but Yandex was bullish on its e-commerce prospects, expecting its subscription model and logistics infrastructure to help it capitalise. 
Yandex's combined services offering should help it become one of the top three e-commerce players once the fragmented market consolidates in two to three years, TMT analyst at Gazprombank Anna Kupriyanova told Reuters.

Yandex's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 15.2% after the results, as of 1616 GMT, also driven higher by hopes that a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may be averted. The shares had slumped almost 13% on Friday during a sell-off in Russian assets over Ukraine concerns.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old privacy lawsuit accusing it of tracking users' internet activity even after they logged out of the social media website.
A proposed preliminary settlement was filed on Monday night with the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, and requires a judge's approval. The accord also requires Facebook to delete data it collected improperly.
Users accused the Meta Platforms Inc unit of violating federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws by using plug-ins to store cookies that tracked when they visited outside websites containing Facebook ""like"" buttons.
Facebook then allegedly compiled users' browsing histories into profiles that it sold to advertisers.
The case had been dismissed in June 2017, but was revived in April 2020 by a federal appeals court, which said users could try to prove that the Menlo Park, California-based company profited unjustly and violated their privacy.
Facebook's subsequent effort to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case was unsuccessful.
The company denied wrongdoing but settled to avoid the costs and risks of a trial, according to settlement papers.
Settling ""is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we're glad to move past this issue,"" Meta spokesman Drew Pusateri said in an email.
The settlement covers Facebook users in the United States who between April 22, 2010 and Sept. 26, 2011 visited non-Facebook websites that displayed Facebook's ""like"" button.

SINGAPORE/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Supply chain shortages and wage inflation are at the top of a list of concerns for aerospace companies attending a depleted Singapore Airshow amid tight health controls this week.
Across aerospace, the suppliers that feed Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus factories are facing an acute shortage of skilled workers and weakened balance sheets after back-to-back crises triggered by a 737 MAX safety grounding and the COVID-19 air travel slump.
A shortage of vital materials, from titanium to microchips, is worrying procurement executives, coming on top of existing fears over available stocks of steel and aluminium.
Those factors - compounding a decade of pressure from Boeing and Airbus to cut prices - are fuelling doubts about the supply chain's ability to meet aggressive narrowbody production ramp-up plans this year and beyond, particularly at Europe's Airbus.
""Wherever I look in the supply chain, I see problems,"" Gary Lowe, Chief Executive of Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) Aerospace North America, told a U.S. supplier conference on the eve of the air show.
Referring to increases in production planned by Airbus and Boeing, he said, ""I think it's going to be a lot more lumpy and problematic than people realise.""
A labour shortage is likely to fuel inflation as firms try and lure back workers who left the industry during the pandemic, while staffing up to meet demand.
The aviation recovery has been swifter than expected, particularly in the narrowbody market, Kailash Krishnaswamy, senior vice president of aftermarket services at Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), said on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow on Tuesday.
""When you have cut down labour by 20% to 50%, ramping up that steep... it's just very challenging getting people back. And when you don't have people back, you don't have parts,"" he added.
And many analysts say the maximum point of vulnerability is when suppliers have to invest in inventory or new equipment to respond to demand coming out of the crisis, rather than during the low point of demand when furlough schemes softened the pain.
""Some of these supply chain guys have been stretched in terms of their balance sheets, cash flows, significant investment into plant and material prior to pandemic. So I am worried about their financial health,"" Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of aircraft lessor Avolon said in Singapore.
Lowe urged suppliers across the industry to be transparent about what they need and avoid stockpiling materials.
After months in which the aerospace industry broadly shrugged off the impact of the semiconductor shortage, aviation is beginning to feel pressure. 
Planemakers can still find supplies of the high-value, low-volume chips used for flight controls and avionics - whose designs are relatively old compared with the lightning pace of change in the consumer products world.
But supplies of chips for more common uses such as aircraft seat electronics are beginning to dry up, a senior procurement source said.
Eric Bernardini, global co-head of aerospace, defence and aviation at U.S. consultants AlixPartners, said the problem is more visible in the supply base of Airbus than Boeing. 
That is because Airbus is pushing ahead faster than its rival despite reservations from its engine suppliers, while delays in the 787 Dreamliner and a gradual recovery in the 737 MAX have left parts of Boeing's supply base with excess inventory.
On Monday, executives from both companies said they were aware of supply chain risks and were factoring them into their planning.
To offset cost pressure, suppliers in the United States are moving some production from states with high labour costs such as California, Bernardini said.

He said the Omicron coronavirus variant has also taken a toll on assembly lines as COVID-19 infections left suppliers short-staffed. In some cases, the variant had put 25% of the workforce out of circulation.  
""This is very disruptive,"" Bernardini said. ""The productivity has decreased.""

Investing.com – Roblox stock (NYSE:RBLX) fell 1% on Tuesday after a BBC report revealed alarming sexual content in some games on the platform.
The BBC investigation also points to how vulnerable children are while playing some of the games. 
The Roblox platform has gained popularity given that it allows users to create their own games and play with others. The company provides developers tools to create the games.
Roblox sex games are commonly referred to on the platform as ‘condos’. Players in condos can freely talk about sex with the space even enabling virtual sex between their avatars.
""We know there is an extremely small subset of users who deliberately try to break the rules,"" BBC quoted a Roblox spokesperson as saying.
While Roblox tries its best to take these games offline, some explicit content does slip through, BBC’s findings reveal.
Roblox put out a blogpost on February 4, detailing what it is doing to protect users. ""We have had a safety-first culture ever since Roblox first launched in 2006, and always will, which means we will always prioritize actions that protect our users, even when that means superseding other considerations, such as unrestricted speech,"" the post said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of deals resolving U.S. government investigations into corporate misconduct declined sharply last year as President Joe Biden's administration took over the reins, U.S. Justice Department data showed on Tuesday. 
The Justice Department's fraud section in Washington, tasked with policing corporate crime, inked eight corporate resolutions in 2021, versus 13 the previous year, largely due to a drop in settlements related to foreign corruption and bribery, the data showed.
The data tracks resolutions such as non-prosecution and deferred prosecution agreements in which the Justice Department agrees to drop the investigation in return for a fine and other conditions.
Global penalties and other payments in cases involving U.S. justice authorities totaled $3.3 billion, down from 2020's $8.9 billion. The share of those that were levied in the U.S. fell more moderately, from $4.4 billion to $3.1 billion.
The tally included high-profile deals with Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) AG to resolve bribery investigations, and a settlement with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co over 737 MAX airliner crashes.
While the decline appears to be at odds with the Biden administration's tough stance on bad corporate actors, it is common for enforcement activity to slow during a change in administration. 
In October, the Deputy Attorney General laid out a series of policies aimed at toughening its stance with big corporations, especially repeat offenders.
Since then, companies have been put on notice and charged for failing to abide by the terms of previous settlements. That includes NatWest Group, which pleaded guilty to market manipulation last year and took additional charges for breaching a prior deal with the Justice Department.

Though the corporate resolutions overall slowed, activity in the section's market integrity unit picked up as the agency pursued investigations into fraud related to COVID-19.
The fraud section charged 333 individuals last year and saw 329 people convicted, up from 326 charged and 213 convicted in 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Tuesday it is extending until early April a production halt to its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle following a recall, but it plans to soon resume retail sales.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened a recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules after a series of fires in parked vehicles, and halted production and retail sales. GM said in August it had recalled all Bolt vehicles built since it launched production in 2017.
GM said it planned to resume production of the Bolt at its Orion Township, Michigan plant the week of April 4.
Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was closing an investigation opened in October 2020 into the Bolt fires ""in view of the recall actions being taken by General Motors (NYSE:GM)."" 
NHTSA said it reviewed reports of 24 Bolt fires, while GM said it suspected 18 fires were linked to the battery issue.
GM said it remained committed to the Bolt and the halt to production ""has enabled us to prioritize battery module replacements."" It felt confident that it could ""balance replacements along with new retail production"".
The automaker said dealers receiving Bolt vehicles built after April 4 could sell them immediately. Recalled vehicles on dealer lots ""will need to have their battery modules replaced before they can be made available for sale.""

Last month, GM said it is spending $4 billion to overhaul and expand the Orion plant, which will build different variants of the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickups.
GM is also investing $2.6 billion with Korean partner LG Energy Solution in a new battery cell plant in Lansing that will supply Orion and other GM assembly plants when it opens in late 2024.

FARNHAM, England (Reuters) - As traditional automakers prepare to churn out electric vans and trucks, startups are focused more than ever on finding a competitive or technological edge to stay on the road once their bigger rivals start moving through the gears.
Spurred on by looming bans on combustion engines in China and Europe, major automakers are striving to bring their commercial electric vehicles (EV) to market fast and ensure they don't get caught out again by another Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
To survive in a world where the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford,  Renault  (PA:RENA) or Stellantis can make hundreds of thousands of vans a year, superior software or technology could make all the difference for newer entrants.
""The startups all bring something to the party,"" says Jean-Michel Renaudie, senior vice president for industrial and commercial transportation at auto supplier  TE Connectivity  (NYSE:TEL). ""The question is, what's your unique selling point?"" 
For British EV startup Bedeo, the answer changed last year due to an unexpected turn of events.
When property developer China Evergrande Group ran into debt trouble, its National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) subsidiary put in-wheel electric motor startup Protean Electric on the block - and Bedeo bought it.
Up until then, Bedeo had been turning vans such as Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY)'s Boxer and Opel's Movano into EVs for Stellantis by adding electric motors, batteries and operating system at a factory in Turkey. It was also selling its own electric vans to customers such as FedEx (NYSE:FDX)'s TNT and Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY)'s DHL. 
Now, Bedeo and Protean plan to develop new EV platforms for commercial vehicles and passenger cars using in-wheel motors, Bedeo Chief Executive Osman Boyner told Reuters. 
In-wheel motors - stand-alone electric motors that can be housed in all or some the wheels of an EV - don't need axles and powertrains so they free up more space inside vans and trucks, as well as extend battery range by reducing vehicle weights. 
At Protean's headquarters in Farnham outside London, Chief Executive Andrew Whitehead shows off a production-ready sports car developed under NEVS with in-wheel motors that has a range of 1,000 km (620 miles), far greater than EVs available now. 
""Every vehicle some day will have in-wheel motors because it's a no-brainer,"" Boyner said. ""We already have this technology on the road and now we just have to market it.""
'GORILLA IN THE MARKETPLACE'
The stakes are high. About 9 million delivery vans are sold worldwide each year and with global distribution and retail companies under increasing pressure to go green, bumper commercial EV orders are set to come thick and fast.
Boyner said Bedeo was talking to major vehicle manufacturers about building commercial EV platforms for them under contract, but also to its own investors about whether to go it alone, with a decision expected by the end of June. 
""Should we invest half a billion and compete with the manufacturers, or should we just provide components?"" he said. ""These manufacturers are so big, they're like governments.""
Major automakers such as GM and Ford are a massive challenge for startups because they can leverage their large factories, global sales, service and distribution networks, and long-standing customer relationships. 
""Knowing how to do supply chain at scale is a huge, huge advantage,"" said Travis Katz, chief executive of BrightDrop, GM's commercial EV business, which has announced major orders from FedEx and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) for its mass-produced EV600 van.
Ford is a leading brand in the United States and European van markets and Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said its Transit van is ""the gorilla in the marketplace"".
""They're ready to cater to any commercial buyer,"" Fiorani said. ""That's a lot to overcome."" 
U.S. startup Rivian Automotive, which makes electric pickups, SUVs and commercial vans, has been touted as the next Tesla and its valuation leapt 53% to surge past $100 billion the day it listed shares in November.
Rivian has landed a 100,000 van order from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but its shares took a hit after the online retailer said last month it was teaming up with Stellantis in a host of areas, from software to cloud computing - to electric vans.
Ross Rachey, Amazon's director of global fleet and products, said the company partners with established players such as Stellantis and Rivian because there ""isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, there's room for many players"".
KNOW-HOW AND NETWORK
Some investors, however, say startups are a riskier bet because they might fail.
""What happens if five years from now these startups just disappear?"" said Scott Schermerhorn, managing director at Mariner Wealth Advisors, which owns GM shares.
FedEx was burned last year when EV startup Chanje, which had promised it 1,000 vans, subsequently went out of business. 
The package delivery company has ordered thousands of electric vans from GM's BrightDrop because it had the ""know-how, the scale, the easy access to capital"" and network to support big fleets, Richard Smith, FedEx Express' head of the Americas, said.
But he said FedEx remained open to startups with ""innovation and new technologies"". 
Ed Sun, managing director and portfolio manager at investor Engine No. 1 in San Francisco, said startups may lack size, but can survive because they often have better software, range, vehicle technology, or a niche.
""The new players are clearly going to take share,"" said Sun, whose firm owns GM and Ford shares.
For British electric van startup Arrival, low-cost innovation is the way forward. 
It plans to develop ""microfactories"" and use a low-cost, lightweight plastic composite for van bodies. Backed by its own fleet management software, its executives say it's a better van than a diesel equivalent for the same price.
Swedish startup Volta Trucks has a head start over traditional truck makers as its 16-tonne electric truck goes into production this year. It has a low, central seat and wrap-around windshield, putting drivers at eye level with pedestrians to improve road safety in busy cities. 
'FUTURE PROOF' 
British electric truck maker Tevva, meanwhile, is going for the niche.
It buys ""gliders"" - the truck frame and cab - from an established automaker to benefit from their networks. Then it adds its own electric motors, battery packs, software and in some cases hydrogen fuel cells, effectively turning those models into clean fuel double acts with a greater potential range.
""We don't need to invest hundreds of millions on parts someone else already does well,"" Chief Executive Asher Bennett told Reuters. 
Tevva, which has been testing trucks with UPS, will launch production this year of two versions of a 7.5-tonne (7,500 kg) vehicle at its plant in Tilbury, England.
One will be an electric model with a range of 160 miles but the other will have a reserve hydrogen fuel cell, boosting its range to 310 miles. Tevva plans to roll out 12-tonne and 19-tonne models with hydrogen boosters. 
Tevva has short-listed sites a U.S. factory and one in mainland Europe, each able to produce some 3,000 trucks a year.
Many in the trucking industry believe hydrogen cells, which only emit water, are the future because they are lighter than batteries, though the fuelling infrastructure is in its infancy.
Bennett said the combination of hydrogen technology, low-cost manufacturing and cloud-based software to optimise vehicle range will ""future proof our company"".
U.S. delivery giant UPS, meanwhile, said working with startups such as Arrival has allowed it to shape the type of EVs that will join its global fleet of 130,000 vehicles. 
UPS worked with Arrival on designing a chassis, powertrain and van bodies and has now ordered up to 10,000 vans.

""We saw that as a solution we can scale up to support our global operations,"" said Luke Wake, UPS vice president of maintenance and engineering.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) is preparing to launch the sale of its stakes in two clusters of gas fields in the southern British North Sea, part of an ongoing retreat of long-time producers from the ageing basin, industry sources told Reuters.
Shell is planning to offer its 50% stake in a cluster of fields in the Clipper hub, as well as the Leman Alpha complex, the three sources said, adding that the assets could fetch up to $1 billion in total.
A Shell spokesperson declined to comment on its plans for the fields, which both supply natural gas via a pipeline to the onshore Bacton gas processing plant in eastern England.
Shell has in recent years sold a number of stakes in ageing fields in the North Sea, including a $3.8 billion package of assets to Harbour Energy in 2017. 
North Sea production has been in decline since the late 1990s, leading oil majors to reduce their role there to focus on more prolific and profitable business elsewhere.
The global transition to low-carbon and renewable energy sources has increased the focus of top international oil companies on projects that can produce the most oil and gas with the lowest emissions intensity, such as large offshore fields.
Shell is developing new projects in the North Sea, including the Penguins project north of the Shetland Islands as well as plans to build offshore wind farms.
Its also plans to develop a new gas field, Jackdaw, in the Shearwater hub were dealt a blow last year when the British regulator rejected development plans on environmental grounds. 
Shell and the regulator have since revived talks on the gas field as Britain grapples with soaring power prices.
HARVEST TIME
Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said earlier this month that Shell wants to sell an average of $4 billion-worth of assets per year.
With oil price near a 7-year high above $90 a barrel, van Beurden told analysts that it made sense to ""think harder if this is the moment to harvest the late-life assets that are probably better off in the hands of others"".
Shell owns a 50% stake in the Clipper and Leman Alpha fields which were part of a large joint venture with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) dating back to the 1960s. Exxon sold its British North Sea assets last year to private equity-backed Neo. 

The Clipper hub is located approximately 41 miles (66 kilometres) from the Norfolk coast and can transport up to 400 million standard cubic feet of gas a day, Shell says.
The Leman Alpha complex includes 5 platforms located around 43 miles (69 kilometres) off the coast.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened markedly higher on Tuesday, in relief at an apparent de-escalation of Russian military activity on the border with Ukraine. 
Russia's Defense Ministry had earlier said that some of the troops who have been taking place in large-scale military exercises will now return to their bases, a day after President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signalled their openness to further diplomatic engagement. 
The relief on the geopolitical shock outweighed the disappointment at another shockingly high U.S. producer price inflation report, which will only increase the likelihood of an aggressive tightening of monetary policy.

Advances were broad-based, with only the energy sector lagging as the geopolitical risk faded from crude prices. U.S. crude futures fell some 4.9% to $90.78 a barrel.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.5% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 5.6%. 
Among individual movers,  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) stock rose 42% amid reports that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is close to buying the Israel-based chipmaker in its efforts to rebuild its contract manufacturing business.
Fidelity National Info (NYSE:FIS)stock fell 9.3% after a disappointing quarterly update, while  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) stock fell 12.5%, unwinding the 7.5% move on Monday that preceded the release of its quarterly numbers.

The launch, initially scheduled for November, was moved to the spring of this year due to a global chip shortage.

The new model will be built at Stellantis' Cassino plant, central Italy, where the carmaker already produces Alfa Romeo's Stelvio SUV and the Giulia sport sedan.
Last week Alfa Romeo unveiled its new Tonale compact SUV, whose launch was also originally expected at the end of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) on Thursday said it will aim for 25% of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030, a move hailed by environmental groups who have called out the soft-drink maker for worldwide plastic pollution.
Coca-Cola is a top target for consumer, investor and environmental groups concerned about petroleum-based plastic single-use bottles clogging oceans, among other problems. 
The company was the world's worst plastic polluter for the fourth year in a row in 2021, according to the global coalition Break Free From Plastic's annual report released in October. 
""We hope that other companies will follow Coke's leadership and set reusable packaging targets,"" said the group's global corporate campaign coordinator Emma Priestland.
Reusable packaging includes containers that can be refilled with original product by companies or consumers, such as refillable fountain drink containers and glass and plastic bottles that are refillable or returnable, the cola maker said, referring to reuse guidelines by nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
In 2020, 16% of the company's packaging was reusable. That year, 90% of its refillable glass and plastic containers were collected, it said.
Coca-Cola's announcement on Thursday is ""the first known goal of its kind"" and ""a welcome change in strategy,"" fund manager Green Century Capital Management said in a statement.
Green Century and activist investor As You Sow filed a shareholder proposal urging Coca-Cola to reduce single-use plastic. They are now considering whether to withdraw their proposal.
If Coca-Cola hits its new goal, it will be ""easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday.
Eight in 10 American adults support government policies to reduce single-use plastic, according to a poll released on Wednesday by advocacy group Oceana.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and other international brands in January called for a global pact that included calls to cut plastic production, a key growth area for the oil industry.
Break Free From Plastic cleaned beaches in 45 countries and found nearly 20,000 Coca-Cola branded products, more than the next two largest plastic polluters - PepsiCo Inc and Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC - combined.

MFE, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and formerly known as Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), has repeatedly called for ProSieben to engage with its drive to consolidate Europe's broadcasting industry.
But ProSieben Chief Executive Rainer Beaujean has expressed scepticism about the idea, saying he does not think cross-border mergers make sense.
In December, Prosieben said it was extending Beaujean's contract until 2027, and the supervisory board intended to propose Andreas Wiele, a former Axel Springer executive board member, as its new chairman.
The decision pre-empted the company's annual general meeting in May, a move which received a cool response by MFE, which said it reserved the right to put forward candidates for the supervisory board.
Wiele and outgoing chairman Werner Brand will seek talks with MFE and other investors in the next two or three weeks, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
After that, MFE is likely to decide whether to support Wiele or propose other candidates for the supervisory board, thus escalating the recent spat, the sources said.
MFE and ProSieben declined to comment.

MFE currently holds 21% of the voting rights in ProSieben and, via other financial instruments, a total of 23.9%.
One industry source said MFE would probably gradually convert the indirect shares into direct ones by the time of the AGM on May 5. If the two sides have not settled their dispute by the AGM, MFE could potentially push through its candidates for the supervisory board if attendance at the AGM is low.

Investing.com -- Marriott International stock (NASDAQ:MAR) traded 3% higher in premarket Tuesday as a receding pandemic helped the hotel chain beat revenue and profit estimates in the fourth quarter.
CEO Anthony Capuano said the company “could begin returning cash to shareholders later in 2022”, assuming there is no great setback in the global recovery. 
Marriott signed around 92,000 rooms in 2021 and more than half of this were in international markets. Over 40% were in the upper upscale and luxury tiers, it said.
The chain expects to continue adding more rooms to its portfolio, having added 20,440 rooms in the fourth quarter.
Leisure demand boomed in the fourth quarter, with slower, yet continued improvement in business transient and group demand, according to the company.
The company said all regions barring China saw a noticeable recovery in the rates of available rooms. However, overall occupancy remained below 2019 levels.
China revenue suffered due to the country’s ‘zero-Covid’ policy.
The company said new bookings across customer segments have rebounded to pre-Omicron levels and that a global recovery should progress meaningfully throughout 2022.
Adjusted profit per share surged more than 10 times to $1.3 due to high impairment charges and loss on the sale of assets in the same quarter last year.

Investing.com -- Shares of Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurants, traded 5% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company beat fourth-quarter estimates for both revenue and profit.
A large, vaccinated population, encouraged by easing restrictions and a weakening virus, helped the restaurant chain book a 14% rise in revenue to $1.6 billionin the three months through the end of 2021. The return of many workers to their offices also aided sales, as did strong digital sales growth. 
For the year, revenue grew more than 15% to $5.8 billion.
The company said it will move to a new master franchisee in China once its business disputes in the country are settled this year.
“Additionally, this agreement will provide for us and our partner to make equity contributions to the Burger King business in China. We believe the agreement will position both the Popeyes and Burger King brands to accelerate growth in China in the upcoming years,” the company said in a statement.
Adding to the gains in the stock was a dividend of 54 cents and a promise by the company to raise the payout in 2022.
Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was up 40% at 74 cents, although the comparison was helped by a loss recognized on an early debt redeption a year earlier.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Louis Vuitton, LVMH's top fashion brand, will raise prices globally on Wednesday as a result of increased manufacturing and transportation costs, a spokesperson for the French luxury goods company in China told Reuters.
Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest luxury brand, will become one of the first big labels in the industry to hike prices widely this year to protect its margins as costs soar.
The price increases will affect Louis Vuitton stores worldwide and cover leather goods, fashion accessories and perfumes, the spokesperson said on Tuesday. She did not give further details on the scale of the rises, beyond saying that they would vary depending on the product.
""The price adjustment takes into account changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation,"" the label said in a statement given to Reuters.
Some bloggers on Chinese social media said the price of some models of handbags such as Capucines and Neverfull, now priced at 46,500 yuan ($7,323) and 12,000 yuan ($1,890) respectively, would rise by 20% or more in China, without citing sources.
PurseBop, a website tracking the luxury market, cited speculation that the increase would be between around 4% on the lower end and 15-18% on average on the higher end.
Presenting record 2021 sales and profits for the fashion and leather goods division, which is led by Vuitton and Dior, LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said in January the group had enough wiggle room to increase prices in an inflationary environment but would have to be ""reasonable."" 
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, luxury goods companies have been taking advantage of surging demand for high-end fashion and accessories to push their brands even more upmarket.

Chanel increased prices on some of its handbags three times last year, with the popular Classic Flap bag, currently selling at $8,200, now costing $3,000 or nearly 60% more than before the pandemic in 2019.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply higher Tuesday on reports that Russia was pulling some troops from the Ukraine border, easing the geopolitical tensions which have recently roiled markets.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 380 points, or 1.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 62 points, or 1.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 290 points, or 2%.
Russia's Defense Ministry said earlier Tuesday that Russia will return some of its troops to their bases after completing a series of drills near the Ukrainian border later this week. Joint exercises with Belarusian troops are due to continue until February 20th, according to the Ministry's website. Newswires reported NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as saying that there are ""grounds for optimism"" but stressed that little had actually changed yet, with regard to the Russian troops' dispositions.
Global stock markets have been kept on edge on fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, with the U.S. closing its embassy in Kyiv and a number of countries urging their citizens to leave the region.
The main averages on Wall Street closed largely lower on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 170 points, or 0.5%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite outperforming, ending flat.
Away from Eastern Europe, investors are fretting about the potential of the Federal Reserve aggressively raising interest rates, as soon as next month, to try and combat surging inflation.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard reiterated on Monday his call for 100 basis points of hikes by June, saying the central bank needs to ""ratify"" market expectations of its upcoming decisions.
With this in mind, investors will carefully study the release of the January producer price index, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). It is likely to have risen at a faster pace in January, at 0.5% month-on-month compared with 0.3% in December.
Turning to the corporate sector, earnings are due from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), both of which should provide clues about the recovery of travel and hospitality activities.
Elsewhere, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be in the spotlight on reports it is close to buying Israeli chipmaker  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) for nearly $6 billion.
Oil prices slumped following the lessening of tensions in Eastern Europe. Fears of sanctions in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine have been behind crude’s rally toward $100 a barrel.
Elsewhere, talks between the U.S. and Iran to revive a 2015 nuclear deal continue, and investors await U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.4% lower at $92.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3% to $9.56.

LONDON (Reuters) -Glencore will set aside $1.5 billion for probes into bribery and market manipulation, which it expects to resolve in 2022, it said on Tuesday, as it announced record earnings from booming raw materials prices.
It also promised a $4 billion payout to its investors and said the trading division could benefit from further disruptions to commodity markets, including from tension between Russia and Ukraine.
The company, one of the world's biggest miners and commodity traders, faces investigations in Brazil, Britain and the United States following corruption allegations relating to some of its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Venezuela since 2018.
""We recognise there has been misconduct in this company historically. We've worked hard to correct that,"" CEO Gary Nagle told reporters.
Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) also faces separate corruption and bribery investigations by Swiss and Dutch authorities.
""Although the Swiss and Dutch investigations are expected to remain outstanding, we believe that with the main investigations quantified, this will likely de-risk the company from this 'unknown known' which has been an overhang for the company since 2018,"" Tyler Broda at RBC Capital Markets said. 
Shares in the company rose 1.9% by 1119 GMT.
In preliminary 2021 results, Glencore said it cut net debt to $6 billion at the end of 2021 from $15.8 billion a year earlier. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 83% to a record $21.3 billion, compared with $11.6 billion a year earlier, in line with a consensus estimate of 15 analysts.
The results surpass a previous high in 2018, when Glencore had also been buoyed by a commodity rally.
The company, which owns more than 150 operating sites, is reviewing 27 assets, 14 of which are being sold, Nagle said.
Glencore, which mines battery metals copper, nickel, and cobalt, is refocusing its portfolio on what it terms ""commodities of the future"" needed for the transition to a greener economy.
But it also sees continued profits from fossil fuels.
Its strategy of depleting its coal mines by the mid-2040s rather than selling them or spinning them off diverges from other diversified miners including BHP and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL).
RUNNING DOWN COAL, 'CAPITALISING' ON UKRAINE
Activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, which last year urged the miner to separate its thermal coal business, has in a letter dated Jan. 24 and made public on Monday, proposed a new structure for Glencore to achieve that.
Nagle on Tuesday said shareholders support the company's strategy.
""Coal does play an important part in this business. In the discussions I've had with shareholders, they're very supportive of our strategy, they're very supportive of coal in this business,"" he said. 
Glencore's biggest shareholders are Qatar Holding, a unit of the Gulf Arab state's sovereign wealth fund, and ex-CEO Ivan Glasenberg with a combined 18.5%.
The $4 billion payout to shareholders announced on Tuesday, including dividend payments and a $550 million buyback, compares with the $2.8 billion Glencore said last August it would return to them.
Prices of thermal coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, are close to all-time highs reached last year on expectations of scarce supplies caused by Chinese power shortages and a European gas squeeze.
Surging prices for fuel and other materials needed in mine processing, coupled with tightening labour markets, drove Glencore's costs up in 2021.
Although metals prices have outpaced inflation, costs can still lead to reduced supplies.
The company put its zinc sulphide operation in Italy on care and maintenance until there is ""a meaningful change in power market prices"".
""We've cut back production at our smelters in Europe because of these high energy prices,"" Nagle said. The company has no plans, at this stage, to bring that production back, he said.
Asked about fears of an impending conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Nagle said Glencore's investments in Russian companies are ""immaterial"" and the company does not have major concerns about them.
""If there is some sort of activity in the Ukraine and Russia, it will cause severe disruptions in various commodity markets... and in those instances, that's where our marketing business really thrives,"" he said. 

""So we are watching carefully and we will see how we can capitalise on the situation.""
Glencore has sold out of Russian oil firm Russneft, capping two decades of investments.

The company came under scrutiny on Monday after a user on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) said that a number of police officers had been eating outside a Starbucks store in the southwestern city of Chongqing before they were told by staff to move away.
The user's description of the incident quickly went viral on the Twitter-like platform, prompting the ruling Communist party's mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper to issue a commentary, in which it called Starbucks ""arrogant"". 
Chinese consumers and media have become more aggressive about protecting customer rights and monitoring the behaviour of big brands, especially from overseas. 
In December, Starbucks apologised and carried out inspections and staff training across all its roughly 5,400 stores in China after a state-backed newspaper said two of its outlets used expired ingredients.
Starbucks apologized on its Weibo account late on Monday for ""inappropriate communications,"" saying the whole thing was a misunderstanding. 
But it said staff had never chased away policemen or tried to file complaints against them.
It continued to face criticism online on Tuesday, with a few small companies announcing on Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok, that they would ""boycott"" Starbucks by forbidding employees from arranging meetings in or buying drinks from the shops of the coffee chain. 

However, Hu Xijin, a prolific commentator in China who is the former editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, urged his Weibo users to see the Starbucks Chongqing incident as an accident and not more, adding that Starbucks's status as a foreign brand should not subject it to more criticism. 
""China is a country that is open to the world,"" he said. ""To label a mistake as arrogance is not conducive to the bigger environment of opening-up.""

85,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 06:01AM ET</span>",Musk donated over $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to charity in Nov,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla chief executive Elon Musk donated a total of 5,044,000 shares in the world's most valuable automaker to a charity from Nov. 19 to Nov. 29 last year, its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed on Monday. 
The donation was worth $5.74 billion, based on the closing prices of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares on the five days that he donated the stock. The filing did not disclose the name of the charity. 
The donation came as the billionaire sold $16.4 billion worth of shares after polling Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about offloading 10% of his stake in the electric-car maker in early November. 
He said on Twitter that he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes in 2021 due to his exercise of stock options set to expire this year. 
He also traded barbs with politicians Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who called on wealthy people to pay more taxes. 
Analysts have said there would be a tax benefit for Musk potentially gifting Tesla stock, since shares donated to charity are not subject to capital gains tax, as they would be if sold.
""His tax benefit would be huge,"" said Bob Lord, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies who studies tax policy.
""He'd save between 40% and 50% of the $5.7 billion in tax, depending on whether he could take the deduction against his California income and he'd avoid the gains tax he would have to pay if he sold the stock.""
Lord added that Musk might have contributed the stock to intermediaries such as ""donor-advised funds,"" not outright to charitable groups. 
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
MUSK FOUNDATION
The donation ranks Musk as America's second-biggest donor after Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates last year, data from the Chronicle of Philanthropy shows.
Musk's public philanthropy gestures have so far trailed other billionaires. Musk and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos have donated less than 1% of their net worth, whereas Warren Buffett and George Soros had given away more than 20% by early September, according to business magazine Forbes.
Musk is president of the Musk Foundation, offering grants for the ""development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity"" among other causes, according to its website. 
Last year, Musk and the foundation offered $100 million prizes to those who can come up with a technology to help remove carbon from the atmosphere.
Last year, he said he was donating $20 million to schools in Cameron County, Texas, the location of a Space X rocket launch site, and $10 million to the City of Brownsville. 
Musk has also flirted with more ambitious philanthropy goals.
On Twitter last year he said, ""If (the United Nations World Food Programme) can describe ... exactly how $6 billion will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.""

He was responding to a plea for a donation from David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme. 
In January last year, he asked Twitter users about ""ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems.)""

Rather than list or seek a private sale, the U.S. investor is opting to recapitalise the logistics company, Europe's largest owner of last-mile logistics, as consumers worldwide increasingly demand same-day delivery of food and other items.
""Logistics is one of our highest conviction themes globally and the sector continues to prove its resiliency and strong growth potential,"" James Seppala, Blackstone (NYSE:BX)'s head of Real Estate Europe, said.
Blackstone launched Mileway in 2019 to operate the more than 1,000 logistics assets the private equity firm has bought to build up its last-mile business to deliver goods to tenants in its properties.
Existing investors in Mileway have been offered a chance to retain or increase their shareholding, or exit for cash, the company said.
The recapitalisation is subject to a ""go-shop"" process, which will start immediately and will run for up to 75 days, Blackstone said.
That process allows Mileway time to see if a better deal can be found for shareholders. 
Mileway has over 1,700 assets across 10 major European countries with a team of over 350 employees across 26 offices, according to the company's website.

Blackstone said the majority of the funding for the recapitalisation would come from existing investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicle (EV) battery startup Britishvolt said on Tuesday it will launch a Series C funding round with a starting investment of 40 million pounds ($54 million) from mining giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
Britishvolt said it aims to raise around 200 million pounds in the funding round, some of which will go toward developing its planned battery factory in northern England and a research and development centre.
So far the company has raised around 100 million pounds.
The startup also said it has signed agreements with four carmakers with cumulative battery demand in 2024 and 2025 of 7 gigawatt hours (GWh) for its battery plant in Blyth.
So far Britishvolt has only publicly announced British carmaker Lotus as a customer. 
Last month Britishvolt secured UK government backing for the Blyth project, unlocking 1.7 billion pounds ($2.30 billion) in private funding.
When the 3.8 billion pound, 45 GWh plant is fully operational in 2027 it should be able to produce battery packs for over 450,000 EVs annually.
Last year Britishvolt and Glencore signed a long-term cobalt supply deal and the mining giant owns an undisclosed stake in the startup. 
The two companies will also jointly develop a new UK battery recycling plant that will help reuse expensive key raw materials like cobalt and lithium.

Britishvolt said its latest fundraising round will be led by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citibank and investment bank Peel Hunt. Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) will act as the company's financial advisor.

Despite hawkish central banks, inflation and asset bubbles being the top three market concerns, only 30% of investors expect an equity bear market in 2022. Russia-Ukraine tensions is the fifth biggest ""tail risk"" for markets.
However, 41% of investors expect flatter yield curve, the highest since Feb 2005, while long technology stocks remains the most crowded trade, according to the February edition of the survey.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Airbus may not be able to raise its jet output as quickly as it hopes because of snags in the supply chain, the head of the world's second-largest aircraft leasing company said on Tuesday.
Avolon CEO Domhnal Slattery told a forum at the Singapore Airshow that the plans ""may not be as ambitious as (Airbus) had articulated to the market six or nine months ago.""
""It isn’t so much that the demand isn’t there. The demand is probably there. It is just the ability of the supply chain below the airframers to actually deliver,"" he said.
""So my sense is the production rates that Airbus want to get to are probably 12-24 months behind where they would like to be.""
The European planemaker cut production of its benchmark A320 medium-haul jets by a third to 40 a month when the coronavirus pandemic severely reduced travel demand in 2020.
In May 2021 it said it would restore this to 64 a month by second-quarter 2023. It later rounded this up to 65 a month by summer 2023. It has also said it is looking at scenarios of 70 a month by the first quarter of 2024 and 75 a month by 2025.
An Airbus spokesman said on Tuesday, ""We are on the trajectory towards rate 65 (a month) by summer 2023 and are assessing potential steps beyond together with our suppliers.""
Avolon is one of a number of leasing companies that are publicly or privately worried that Airbus is pushing production up too quickly. Suppliers including the French co-parent of engine maker CFM International have voiced concerns too.
The president of CFM International, Gael Mehuest, told the same event in Singapore on Tuesday that the supply chain is ""under constraint right now"".
""We had to virtually stop all production and restart it. It is not something you do easily. It does create some difficulties and we are working on that,"" he said. CFM is co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).

Airbus has said its production forecasts are underpinned by strong demand for its jets and a rebound in domestic flying.
Asked on Monday whether supply chain problems could hamper its output plans, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said, ""we are doing everything we can for that not to be the case.""

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) traded 1% higher in premarket Tuesday on reports it is close to buying Israeli chipmaker  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) for nearly $6 billion.
The transaction is in line with CEO Pat Gelsinger’s plans to turn Intel into a contract manufacturer, much like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chipmaker with 2021 revenue at about $57 billion. Tower is a much smaller business with 2020 revenue at $1.3 billion. Its shares climbed nearly 51% in premarket.
A foundry making chips that go into cars, servers, TVs and laptops is a complex unit. Very few companies do it all, most choosing to either just design it or manufacture for clients according to their needs. Making chips for more clients that will include rivals will help Intel achieve greater economies of scale.
Last month, Intel committed $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio. It is also building two factories in Arizona with an investment of $20 billion. Gelsinger has been pushing to restore his company’s dominance of the industry, and also reshore manufacturing from Asia to shorten supply chains.
At Monday’s market cap of $3.6 billion, the final tag for Tower is likely to include a hefty premium, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Besides its home country, Tower has plants in California, Texas and Japan.
According to a previous report by the WSJ, Intel had hoped to buy GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS), a bigger company worth around $30 billion, but owner Mubadala, an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, opted in favor of a public listing.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Food group Nestle is expected to post organic sales growth of 7.1% for 2021 on Thursday, almost twice as high as the year before thanks to strong demand for coffee and pet food, but high input costs will start taking a toll on profitability.
Markets will focus on the guidance for this year, especially on the KitKat and Nescafe maker's ability to raise prices without endangering volume growth and market shares. The outlook for coffee, the petcare business and plant-based food that benefited during the pandemic will be scrutinised. 
Any indication the company could further reduce its stake in cosmetics group L'Oreal, maybe to finance a large acquisition, would also make headlines. 
Organic sales, which strip out currency swings and acquisitions, are expected to rise by 7.1% in the full year, including a 5.2% rise in volumes and a 1.8% increase in prices, according to a company-compiled consensus.
The forecast implies a slowdown in the final quarter from the 7.6% growth rate seen in the first nine months.
Under pressure from soaring costs for commodities, energy, transport and labour, Nestle's trading operating profit margin is expected to decline slightly to 16.7%, from 16.9% in 2020.
Peer Unilever (NYSE:UL) last week warned of a hit to profitability as it struggles to lift prices enough to offset higher costs.
""Unilever's warning on its margin clearly rattled the market,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said. 
""However, I tend to think Nestle is in more premium categories and it should be able to more or less offset inflationary pressures through pricing in 2022."" 
Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo downgraded Nestle to ""underperform"" last month, pointing to tough comparables in coffee and petcare and margin headwinds this year. 
Nestle's shares, down 8% so far this year, are trading at over 24 times forward earnings, according to Refinitiv data, at a significant premium to Danone and Unilever. 

In December, Nestle cut its stake in L'Oreal to 20.1% and announced a new 20 billion Swiss franc ($21.65 billion) share buyback programme. It also recently acquired a majority stake in protein powder maker Orgain.

Last year MAG said it had agreed with Boeing to take delivery of the planes from 2024.

It was originally scheduled to take delivery in 2020, but the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after two crashes, prompting several airlines and lessors to cancel orders.
MAG also has six Airbus A350-900 planes on long-term leases with Air Lease (NYSE:AL).

""Whichever path is chosen by ABB to separate the business, this process should be completed in the first half of 2022"", the group said in a statement.
The separation of the business, which competes with Britain's Napier, part of Wabtec, Germany's KBB and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is part of ABB Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren's plan to focus the portfolio on electrification and automation.
The turbocharging business employs over 2,300 people and had around $750 million in sales during 2021.
ABB did not give any figures on profitability, but has said previously that the business has an ""attractive"" profit margin. 
Rosengren said two weeks ago a spinoff onto the SIX Swiss Exchange during the second quarter of this year was the most likely outcome.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 03:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: The work of central banks,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao. 
The Fed hasn't yet started raising interest rates, and in the euro zone, higher rates are likely many months away. But markets have started doing the central banks' jobs for them -- an index of financial conditions compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is around the tightest since May 2020. 
Look at the metrics feeding into such indexes -- since the start of this year, oil prices, government borrowing costs and yield premia on corporate debt have all risen. With markets pricing rate rises ahead, world stocks are down 6%. 
How financial conditions behave, inevitably impact the spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households, so the more conditions tighten now, the less central banks may need to do later.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts reckon, therefore, a 25 basis-point rate hike is what the Federal Reserve will deliver next month, rather than the 50 bps that is priced.
Still, analysts' advice to keep buying equities is finding few takers. Wall Street slipped again on Monday on fears that diplomacy may fail to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
And hawkish St Louis Fed governor James Bullard called for a faster, front-loaded tightening timeline. 
In fact positioning on Nasdaq 100 futures is the most extended net short ever seen, according to Citi. 
So all eyes on Tuesday's meeting between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Before news emerges from that meeting, nervous traders are selling stocks and buying gold and government bonds.
Economies seem to be chugging along in the meantime -- Japan's Q4 GDP expanded at an annualised 5.4% while British unemployment stayed at 4.1% in late-2021.
Yet UK workers' earnings fell by 0.8% when adjusted for inflation, meaning the Bank of England will stay on the case with rate hikes in coming months.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's fifth-largest bank BPER Banca has agreed to buy troubled rival Carige, it said late on Monday, in a deal that will end a seven-year crisis at the regional lender.
BPER last month entered exclusive talks over Carige with Italy's FITD depositor protection fund, which owns 80% of the bank since a 2019 rescue financed by the industry.
After roughly halving its initial capital injection request, BPER has said it would take on Carige at a token 1 euro price, provided that FITD pumps 530 million euros ($599.8 million) into the Genoa-based lender to cover restructuring and clean-up costs.
BPER, which is being advised by Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and Rothschild, will then buy out remaining Carige investors at 0.80 euros per share. 
""The deal represents an opportunity for BPER, which will further consolidate its positioning, and the group has a track record in integrating and extracting synergies,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
Together with bigger rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Carige was one the main banking headaches stopping Italy from completing a restructuring that started in 2015 and has cost healthy lenders more than 10 billion euros in rescue aid.
In 2019 Italian banks spent 600 million euros to salvage Carige through FITD, which has worked with KPMG on selling its stake.
The Carige deal propels BPER forward on the expansion path set out by leading shareholder UnipolSAI, Italy's second-biggest insurer, which is looking to build a wide distribution network for its products.
Pushed by UnipolSAI to facilitate Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY)'s takeover of mid-tier peer UBI, BPER last year boosted its assets by 40% by buying branches sold for antitrust reasons in the merger.
Carige will further lift BPER's assets to about 155 billion euros, making it Italy's No.4 bank and a more direct competitor to Banco BPM, the No.3 and a longstanding possible merger partner before the latest collapse in talks last year.

The deal is expected to close by June 30, BPER, FITD and Carige said in three separate statements.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, rebounding on reports that Russia has returned at least some of its troops massed on the Ukrainian border to their bases.
By 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.8%.
Global stock markets have been kept on edge on fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, particularly after the U.S. closed its embassy in Kyiv late Monday, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken citing the “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces” on Ukraine’s border.
However, the news agency Interfax reported Russia's Defense Ministry as saying that Russia will return some of its troops to their bases after completing a series of drills later this week. Joint exercises with Belarusian troops are due to continue until February 20th, according to the Ministry's website.
The news follows a carefully-orchestrated televised exchange between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergy Lavrov on Monday in which the two agreed to continue diplomatic negotiations with the West over the future of Ukraine. 
""“February 15, 2022 will go into history as the day western war #propaganda failed,"" said Foreign Office spokeswoman Maria Zakharova via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""They have been disgraced and destroyed without a single shot being fired.”

Oil prices weakened Tuesday following the lessening of tensions in Eastern Europe. Fears of sanctions in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine have been behind crude’s rally toward $100 a barrel.

BEIJING (Reuters) -When Eileen Gu won Olympic gold in the Big Air, sales of her red Anta ski suit, complete with slipdrag reduction technology, surged 20-fold on Chinese e-commerce platform JD (NASDAQ:JD).com.
 Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) sold out of Gu-endorsed drinks, with a spike in cup-holders bearing her image, and the Chinese chain immediately said it would launch more Gu-linked products throughout the year.
The San Francisco-born skier won a silver medal in Tuesday's slopestyle final, earning more praise on Chinese social media for redeeming herself on a third jump after an earlier mistake.
With another gold medal still in the offing, her closely scrutinised decision to compete for China appears to be paying off, commercially at least.
Already Team China's most popular athlete, the fashion model and incoming Stanford student is sponsored by two dozen brands, from French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton to mass market Chinese sportswear maker Anta.
Her global endorsements include  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), Victoria's Secret,  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF) and Oakley, which have all targeted the China market in recent years.
Her soaring popularity in China could propel her into the ranks of the world's top earning athletes if she can continue to avoid major controversy.
Michael Payne, former marketing chief of the International Olympic Committee, cited China's aim to get 300 million people involved in winter sports when he described the opportunity for Gu as unprecedented.
""If you look at the most successful athletes like Michael Phelps, I think we were talking about earning up to $100 million ... there's no question that if she continues to bring in the golds, she will be in the same league.""
Winter Olympians, competing in niche sports, typically lag their Summer counterparts in earning power. Exceptions include snowboarder Shaun White, who made $8 million in 2009 in his heyday and $1.5 million in the 12 months leading up to the Beijing Games, according to Forbes.
GU-MANIA
Gu's looks, athletic achievements, dual-national appeal and power as an influencer put her on a level of her own.
Following her freeski Big Air gold medal win, Tiffany & Co began trending on Chinese social media after she removed her Anta gloves to reveal four rings that netizens quickly identified as made by the LVMH-owned jeweller, which Gu endorses.
Chinese media has buzzed with speculation over Gu's endorsements, with the Beijing News reporting her fee at $2.5 million after-tax and total earnings from brand deals in the past year over 100 million yuan, citing industry sources. News outlet Tianxiashangwang estimated that Gu's earnings since the start of 2021 exceeded 200 million yuan ($31.5 million).
Her agent Tom Yaps did not respond to a request for comment.
Gu ticks multiple boxes in China thanks to her image as a model student and pride in her decision to compete for the country of her mother's birth, said Bryce Whitwam, adjunct professor of marketing at NYU in Shanghai.
""She is extraordinarily charismatic and her appealing to Chinese culture and the simple fact that she came to China to want to be Chinese, that is a huge win for her,"" he said, describing China's ""Gu-mania"".
PITFALLS
With her carefully worded answers, which avoid directly addressing questions about her citizenship, and Beijing-accented Mandarin that has charmed many, Gu has managed to sidestep controversy during the Games, despite some online grumbling that she lives a life of privilege unattainable to most.
Hu Xijin, a prominent columnist at the Communist Party-run Global Times, suggested on Sunday that because Gu could end up choosing U.S. citizenship, she should be cheered on as part of team China, not as a patriotic symbol. 
""She gives the Chinese public happiness, so there is no shame in seeking a commercial return,"" Hu wrote. ""But the political elements need to be minimised as much as possible. It is risky for Gu Ailing to be that kind of a vector,"" he said.
Unlike her gravity-defying ski tricks, Gu's public persona is low-risk: she supports Black Lives Matter but avoids questions about human rights in China, instead presenting herself as a bridge-builder and global ambassador for skiing.
""Eileen has done a great job in making sure she does not say the wrong thing, but you know what? You are going to mess up sometimes,"" Whitwam said.
Gu's earning power in both countries could be dimmed by worsening bilateral tensions.
Her decision to compete for China has drawn criticism in the United States, while in China she must navigate what has been tightening oversight over celebrities, with many stars cancelled by authorities after missteps. 

""It could be a simple Tweet, it could be a very simple mistake and they will wipe her clean from any kind of coverage, like they’ve done with many other Chinese celebrities,"" Whitwam said.

(Reuters) - Emerging Asian bonds ex-China attracted the biggest monthly foreign inflow in five months in January, as some signs of economic recovery in the region eased concerns over monetary policy tightening by major central banks.

""Overall flow picture in January underlines the attractive risk reward profile of Asia local currency yield bonds for global investors,"" said Jennifer Kusuma, Asia rates strategist at ANZ.
Thai bonds attracted $2.08 billion worth of foreign money last month, the biggest since July 2014, as rising exports and easing COVID-19 curbs boosted hopes of an economic recovery.[L1N2U1091]

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian mining company Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) has dropped a $1.2 billion claim against individuals and entities linked to Israeli-born billionaire Beny Steinmetz, the miner said in a statement on Monday.
Vale and Steinmetz have been locked in a multi-pronged legal battle for years resulting from a failed mining joint venture in Guinea. At the heart of the dispute is whether Steinmetz's mining group, BSGR, obtained the rights to the Simandou iron ore deposit in that nation by fraudulent means, charges which Steinmetz has denied.
In the statement, Vale said the decision to drop the case was based on purely technical grounds and that the company continued to pursue parallel litigation against BSGR.
""Vale's initiative to file a notice to discontinue this specific fraud process, against individuals and two entities linked to BSGR, is based eminently on procedural grounds, following the advice from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, in charge of the case, linked to a possible statute of limitations argument that the claim against those defendants might be time-barred,"" Vale said.
Representatives for Steinmetz could not immediately be reached for comment outside normal business hours.

In a statement to the Financial Times, however, he said that Vale's reasons to drop the case go ""well beyond limitations.""
""We have a lot to say and will wait until we have received a final judgment on Tuesday, 15th February,"" he was quoted as saying in the newspaper.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning, with concerns over the geopolitical risks in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tightening of monetary policy to fight inflation continuing to mount.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.27% by 9:26 PM ET (2:26 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day showing that the GDP grew 1.3% quarter-on-quarter and 5.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.11%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.17%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.15%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.44% while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.45%. The People’s Bank of China injected a net CNY100 billion ($15.73 billion) into the banking system earlier in the day via its medium-term lending facility (MFL). The MLF rate was unchanged at 2.85%.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Ukraine continue, with Russia continuing to refute U.S. allegations that it could invade Ukraine imminently. The tensions continue to keep the oil markets on edge, with WTI futures trading near the $95-mark, which it passed earlier for the first time since 2014.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s “sarcastic” comments on Monday about the rest of the world predicting a Russian attack on Wednesday also saw the situation take a bizarre turn.
Markets were already jittery before the crisis over Ukraine flared, thanks to a possible withdrawal of stimulus by the Fed and high inflation.
“What we are seeing is a Fed that is reacting to inflationary prints even though many of the pressures on inflation are factors that the Fed really can’t solve,” Invesco chief global market strategist Kristina Hooper told Bloomberg.
“So that certainly increases the risks and reduces the clarity.”
Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the central bank needs to move forward with its plans to raise rates to underline its inflation-fighting credibility. His colleague, Fed Bank of Kansas City President Esther George, added the Fed should take a systematic approach in removing policy accommodation but be careful to not “oversteer.”
More Fed officials, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, will speak on Thursday. The U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, with speakers including Fed officials Charles Evans, Christopher Waller, and Lael Brainard, will take place a day later.
G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors will also meet from Feb. 17 to 18.
Meanwhile, the Fed will release the minutes from its latest meeting on Wednesday. The U.S. also releases its producer price index (PPI) later in the day, with China releasing its own PPI and consumer price index a day later."

BOSTON (Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc's stock price tumbled more than 50% in the last three months of 2021 but several prominent investment firms were so sure the at-home fitness company could regain its footing that they bought new or added to existing positions.
Durable Capital Partners, run by former T. Rowe Price investment executive Henry Ellenbogen, bought 5.4 million shares of the company known for its stationary bikes, treadmills and on demand classes, according to regulatory filings made on Monday.
Ricky Sandler's Eminence Capital bought 2.6 million shares. Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital Management took a new stake with 1.6 million shares, the filings showed.
The 13-F filings require fund managers to detail the amount of stock they held in U.S. companies at the end of the previous quarter. While the filings are backward looking, they are watched closely for possible investment trends.
Tiger Global Management, already a Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) investor, bought another 3 million shares, increasing its investment by 41% and Baillie Gifford, Peloton's largest shareholder, added another 3.4 million shares, raising its stake by 12%, the filings show.
It was unclear when those investors bought. On Dec. 31, the last day of the quarter, Peloton traded at $35.76, down significantly from where it started the quarter at $86.71.
Among the considerable sales, Altimeter Capital exited its Peloton position when it sold 5.6 million shares. Coatue Management sold 3.7 million shares, slicing its holding by 89%, the filings showed.
Also Viking Global Investors sold 2.5 million shares, cutting the position by 39%. Daniel Loeb's Third Point exited its position by selling 600,000 shares. 
Since then Peloton shares have slid further. They closed at $32.83 on Monday. The company 's value has tumbled to $11.5 billion far from its peak of $50 billion. 
Activist investment firm Blackwells Capital last month began suggesting the company sell itself. Some potential buyers appear to have been speaking with bankers even as Peloton signaled it was not for sale.
While Peloton became a pandemic-era darling, its fortunes began fading due to supply chain issues, slowing sales as gyms opened up again, high costs and a recall of one of its products.

Last week the company said John Foley, a co-founder and its chief executive, was moved into the executive chairman role and replaced as CEO by Barry McCarthy, a former finance chief at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
Wall Street analysts generally welcomed McCarthy, but the share price remains depressed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven state government employee pension funds including CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension plan, took stakes in electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive Inc in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, according to securities filings released Monday. 
The Teacher Retirement System of Texas, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System were among the seven as well as pension funds for Utah, Colorado, North Carolina and Wisconsin, according to data from fund tracker WhaleWisdom. 
CalPERS, which has approximately $492 billion under management, bought slightly more than 305,000 shares in the company, while the $191 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas fund took a position of about 33,000 shares in the company. 
The moves illustrate a greater appetite for risk among U.S. pension funds as they continue to face funding gaps despite U.S. equity market gains since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Overall, the average pension plan's funded ratio - a measure of assets compared with liabilities - remains below 75%, according to sovereign investor specialist Global SWF. 
Shares of Rivian popped nearly 10% on Monday after the disclosure last week that several prominent investors including billionaire George Soros and hedge fund Tiger Global added shares in the company last quarter. 

As of Friday's close, shares of Rivian were down 43% for the year to date. At their Monday afternoon trading price near $64.75, shares of the company remain 64% below the high of $179.46 on Nov. 16, less than a week after the company raised $12 billion in the largest stock debut of 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Lockheed Martin's exit from its planned purchase of engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne has refocused investors on the compounding list of problems at both companies, as pressure grows on Lockheed management to improve lagging performance. 
Shares of both  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc fell on Monday after Lockheed walked away from the deal.
Aerojet said it now planned to deliver value to shareholders by advancing hypersonics and strategic, tactical and missile defense systems. Lockheed said it will focus ""on the most effective use of capital with the highest return on investment, including our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders.""
Lockheed's problems are stacking up, and exiting the deal dealt a loss to CEO Jim Taiclet who has not been able to deliver significant share price appreciation since taking over in June 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic.
In October, management cut sales expectations for both 2021 and 2022, which sent shares down 12%. 
The weapons maker said COVID-19 had hobbled its supply chain, but on its post-earnings call with analysts in October, Ron Epstein with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) forced Taiclet to defend his leadership when he asked, ""Where are you taking the company? And what's the vision here? Because it really seems - and I know this may be - might sound unfair, but it seems a little bit rudderless right now.""
Lockheed's strategy of facilitating the military ""internet of things"" has failed to gain traction with investors, analysts have said. Making matters worse, Lockheed's premiere product, the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, could see softer demand from the U.S. Air Force in coming years. The jet makes up about a quarter of the company's revenue.
In an interview on Monday, Epstein said, ""Their strategy has to pivot. If the defense budget (is) growing low-single digits and you have peer companies that are growing with low-single digits and you're not, most likely the market's not going to be pleased with that.""
Cowen analyst Cai Von Rumohr said in a note on Monday that while Lockheed had indicated it could still do mergers, ""It's more likely to seek small technology accelerators rather than larger transactions that might face stiffer regulatory hurdles."" Von Rumohr said that in the near-term it was possible the Bethesda, Maryland-based company could increase its share buyback.
At Aerojet, a top shareholder is seeking to revamp the board of directors.

On Feb. 1, Warren Lichtenstein, Aerojet's executive chairman of the board, launched a proxy fight to replace three members of the company's board of directors. He wants to ensure the company has the ability to succeed without the deal.
Aerojet filed a countersuit to a lawsuit by Lichtenstein on Feb. 11 asking the court to appoint a special committee in response to the proxy contest.

The fund's Lucid holdings were valued at $38.6 billion as of December, up from $25.8 billion at the end of September, the filing showed. 
Lucid's listing in July last year was a huge boost for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), which currently holds a nearly 62% stake in Lucid, had invested more than $1 billion in the company in 2018 for a substantial stake and increased its investment in February 2021. 
Shares of Lucid have fallen 28% so far this year.
The PIF also owns a 3.75% stake in ride-sharing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).
The sovereign wealth fund sharply cut its stake in  Prologis  (NYSE:PLD), while substantially increasing its stake in Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), a technology platform in the fashion industry, to 3.3 million class A shares.
It also raised its stake in Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).

PIF, which manages about $480 billion in assets, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a national strategy aimed at diversifying the kingdom's economy and cutting reliance on hydrocarbons.

Meta Platforms fell 26% on Feb. 3, erasing more than $200 billion in market value, after the company after reported its first ever decline in global daily active users and cited increasing competition from TikTok and other platforms in its weaker-than-expected forecast.

The selling came as institutional investors appeared to take steps back from high-flying technology names, which had helped the broad S&P 500 reach record highs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns about rising inflation have prompted investors to punish companies that did not meet or exceed Wall Street expectations this earnings season, while greatly rewarding those that did.

Shares of Netflix fell 20% on Jan. 21 after the streaming company forecasted weaker than expected subscriber growth. Shares of the company are down 34% for the year to date. 

Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 13.5% - pushing its market value up by a one-day record $190 billion - after the company reported robust earnings in early February.

BEAUMONT, Texas (Reuters) -Union officials on Monday agreed to schedule a membership vote on a contract offer that could end a nearly 10-month worker lockout at an  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) refinery in southeast Texas, a union official said. 
The leadership of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 13-243 agreed to put a sweetened Exxon contract proposal received last week to its about 600 members. A vote was scheduled for Monday, Feb. 21. 
On Friday, Exxon agreed to contract changes that would make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a paid holiday, updates language regarding a union committee and adds a new job description for operators in the 369,024 barrel-per-day refinery and lubricant facility.
""With the company's latest move, with the MLK holiday added, we felt it was time for the membership to have the say-so on where we go from here,"" said Bryan Gross, a USW International representative. 
""We still don't think the offer is where it should be,"" said Gross, noting union officials are making no recommendation on the offer. ""But it has been 10 months. We want people to vote how they feel. If they want to vote 'no,' we'll keep on. If they want to vote 'yes,' then we'll go from there."" 
Exxon was not immediately available to comment. 
The oil company has said the lockout would end when either a contract acceptable to the company is ratified or the union is removed. 
Beaumont union workers have been without paychecks since May with managers, supervisors and temporary replacement workers continuing to produce gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil. 
In October, the workers had voted against an earlier Exxon offer.
If workers accept the latest contract offer, the union and Exxon will have to negotiate a return-to-work agreement spelling out rules for returning workers before they can re-enter the refinery. 

Exxon has said it began the lockout to avoid disruption from a threatened strike at the refinery and adjoining lubrication oil plant, which makes Mobil 1 motor oil. 
A vote on the union's removal was conducted by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in November and December. But the ballots were impounded on Dec. 29 by the board so it could review charges filed by the USW alleging Exxon undertook the lockout to force the union's removal.

(Reuters) -Intel Corp is close to buying Israeli firm  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) for about $6 billion, a source familiar with the matter said, as the U.S. company looks to advance its strategy of contract manufacturing chips for other businesses. 
A deal could be unveiled as soon as this week, the person said on Monday, declining to be named as the matter was private.
The potential purchase would deepen Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s presence in a space dominated by Taiwan-based TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker. It also comes at time when the global semiconductor shortage has hampered the production of everything from smartphones to cars.
Tower Semiconductor, whose U.S. shares surged 53% in extended trading, specializes in analog chips used in the automotive, mobile, medical and aerospace industries. It had a market capitalization of $3.6 billion as of Monday's close. 
Both Intel and Tower Semiconductor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. chipmaker said last month it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio. The move is aimed at restoring Intel's dominance in chip-making and reducing America's reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs.
Intel was also looking to buy GlobalFoundries for about $30 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report in July, but the chipmaker went public a few months later. 

Chipmaking is expensive and difficult, so most companies either design or produce. Intel has opened up its factories to rival semiconductor designers to spread costs.
Intel shares were up 0.4% after the news on the Tower Semiconductor deal, which was first reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-near-roughly-6-billion-deal-to-buy-tower-semiconductor-11644876391?mod=latest_headlines by the Wall Street Journal.

(Reuters) - A Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary came under attack in court on Monday for attempting to use the bankruptcy process to resolve tens of thousands of claims that its baby powder and other talc-based products caused cancer. 
The subsidiary, LTL Management, is fighting to remain in bankruptcy, arguing that is the best way to reach an ""equitable, efficient, and consensual resolution"" of more than 38,000 claims alleging that J&J's talc-based products caused cancers including mesothelioma. J&J maintains that its consumer talc products are safe.
J&J used a legal maneuver known as the ""Texas two-step,"" which allows companies to split valuable assets from liabilities through a so-called divisive merger. 
Lawyers representing cancer patients say that the bankruptcy case is meant to delay and frustrate lawsuits that would otherwise go to a jury trial against J&J directly. 
""At its core, this case is rotten,"" Jeffrey Jonas, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs' committees said during Monday's opening arguments.
Robert Wuesthoff, president of LTL Management, testified that it would be impossible to take all of the cases to trial. Before LTL was formed, J&J had completed about 10 talc trials per year, Wuesthoff said.
Most of the cancer plaintiffs would be better off resolving their claims in a bankruptcy settlement than hoping to join the ""select few"" who won ""lottery-sized awards"" in jury trials, he added. 
As Reuters has reported, J&J secretly launched ""Project Plato"" last year to shift liability from its pending talc lawsuits to the newly created subsidiary, which was then to be put into bankruptcy.
If J&J gets bankruptcy-court approval, such a strategy, while rarely used, could be adopted more widely by big companies facing liability, according to lawyers for talc plaintiffs, as well as some legal experts.
Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives in July 2021 proposed a bill that would block the maneuver. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in New Jersey has scheduled a five-day trial to consider a bid by committees representing the plaintiffs to dismiss the bankruptcy case. Kaplan has said he intends to rule before the end of the month.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that allowing the LTL bankruptcy to proceed would unfairly cap the payout at the $2 billion that J&J has proposed to make available for people who have been harmed. 
Brian Glasser, an attorney who represents mesothelioma claimants, said on Monday that J&J settled 6,846 talc cases for $966 million before deciding to push those legal risks into LTL. 
If J&J reached comparable settlements in all of the 38,000 talc cases pending against it, the company would have about $5.5 billion in liability, which would not cause ""financial distress"" to a company of J&J's size, Glasser said.
""Just because Johnson & Johnson is both rich, and fearful of reputational harm, does not give it a right to opt out of the jury system,"" Glasser said.
Shares of J&J ended down 1.3% at $165.60.
The talc lawsuits have been temporarily halted while J&J, which has a market value exceeding $446 billion, awaits the outcome of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings.

A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&J knew for decades that trace amounts of asbestos, which has been linked to mesothelioma, lurked in its baby powder and other cosmetic talc products. 
The company stopped selling baby powder in the United States and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the talc-based product.

In a statement, Buffett said the 96-year-old Murphy phoned him on Monday and said his recovery ""convinced him that he would feel more comfortable ending his activities at Berkshire. I accepted his wish. He will continue as a major shareholder and friend.""
Murphy had been a Berkshire director since 2003.
His departure followed the 2020 exit from the board of Bill Gates, another friend of Buffett's and co-founder of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), after 16 years of service. Another director, Walter Scott, died in September.
Gates was replaced by Ken Chenault, the former chief executive of  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), a large Berkshire investment.
In 2021, Berkshire added Buffett's daughter Susan Buffett and fund manager Christopher Davis, the chairman of Davis Select Advisors, to its board.

Berkshire did not immediately name a replacement for Murphy. Three other Berkshire directors are in their 90s: Buffett, Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, and businessman David ""Sandy"" Gottesman.
""Tom Murphy has taught me more about running a business than any other person,"" Buffett said. ""We have been friends and mental partners for more than 50 years. My only regret is that I didn't meet him earlier.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian holding company Itausa SA on Monday posted a 53% jump in its fourth-quarter recurring profit, mainly helped by gains with lender Itau Unibanco Holding SA and broker XP (NASDAQ:XP) Inc, it said in a filing.
The company reported recurring net income, which excludes one-off items, of 4.185 billion reais ($802.51 million) in the last quarter of 2021. Net profit was 4.117 billion reais, 12% above the same period from 2020. 
The performance was ""driven mainly by the better results at Itau Unibanco, as a result of the growth in its loan book"", said Itausa in a securities filing.
Recurring results attributed to Itausa's stakes in the financial sector were 2.725 billion reais, rising 15% year-on-year. Last week, both Itau and XP Inc reported a surge in fourth quarter profit.
Although representing a smaller part of Itausa's results, the company's non-financial sector investments, which includes stakes in shoemaker Alpargatas and wood panels manufacturer Dexco SA, also showed an significant improvement.
They were responsible for 859 million reais in the fourth quarter recurring income, a 55% jump on an annual basis.
Itausa's net asset value declined 21% to 100.4 billion reais from the previous year, while its holding discount reached 21.5% at the end of 2021, down 1.2 percentage point from the previous year.

The company's management believes that ""the current discount level is exaggerated and does not reflect the appropriate level of the indicator,"" it said.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc acquired nearly $1 billion of shares in Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) before  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to buy the video game maker for $68.7 billion, according to a Monday regulatory filing.
Berkshire said that as of Dec. 31, it owned 14.7 million shares worth about $975 million of the ""Call of Duty"" maker.
Microsoft announced its plan to buy Activision Blizzard on Jan. 18, in its largest ever acquisition.
Activision shares are up 23% this year to $81.50, though they remain well below the proposed $95 per share takeover price, reflecting potential antitrust concerns.
Another prominent investor, Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point, bought 2 million Activision shares in the fourth quarter.
Berkshire disclosed its Activision stake in a filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock investments as of Dec. 31.
Investors monitor Berkshire's investments closely to see where Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value.
The filings do not say who bought and sold what, though Buffett generally handles larger investments.
Other media have quoted Buffett, a longtime friend of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, as saying he would not buy Microsoft shares because of potential conflicts of interest.
Gates ended his 16-year run on Berkshire's board in 2020. Buffett had been a trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation but resigned in 2021.
In the fourth quarter, Berkshire also added to its stake in oil company  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), while reducing its holdings in healthcare companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and Abbvie Inc.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Berkshire's largest common stock holding.
Stock sales and Buffett's six-year drought in buying large whole companies have contributed to Berkshire's record $149.2 billion cash stake as of Sept. 30, 2021, despite at least $21.9 billion of stock buybacks that year.

Berkshire is expected to disclose more about its stock purchases, buybacks and cash on Feb. 26 when it releases year-end results and Buffett's widely read annual shareholder letter.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -A flock of about 240,000 chickens owned by  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) in Kentucky tested positive for a highly lethal form of bird flu, government officials and the company said on Monday, widening an outbreak that threatens the U.S. poultry industry.
Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky. Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.
The broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.
They said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.
Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.
Tyson Foods is working with government authorities to prevent the disease from spreading and is heightening safety measures at other local farms, spokesman Gary Mickelson said.
The outbreak is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels because thousands of farms raise chickens for Tyson, he said. Mickelson added that Tyson Foods' chicken products are safe to eat.
On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.
The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia, that have already been culled, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The cases do not present an immediate public health concern, the agency said.
Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.
The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state. Almost 18% of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.
The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14% from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index closed modestly lower on Monday, largely recovering from a sharp sell-off, as U.S. plans to close its Kyiv embassy in Ukraine sent simmering geopolitical tensions to a boil.
All three major U.S. stock indexes dropped sharply after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the relocation of U.S. diplomatic operations to western Ukraine, in a possible sign of an imminent Russian invasion.
Adding to uncertainty, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Wednesday would be the day of the attack. Ukrainian officials later said Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on that day but responding with skepticism to foreign media reports. 
By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average joined the S&P 500 in negative territory, while the Nasdaq Composite Index ended essentially unchanged. 
Ongoing concerns over aggressive policy from the Federal Reserve also have contributed to recent market volatility.
""There's a lot of cross currents, a lot of potential negatives in the markets,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
France's foreign minister said everything was in place for a Russian attack and that Europe was ready to impose massive sanctions if it happened.
Geopolitical anxieties have been simmering in recent weeks as negotiators scrambled to find a diplomatic path forward as Russia amassed troops along the Ukrainian border.
Still, market fallout due to geopolitical turmoil tends to be fleeting, according to historical data.
""History actually tells investors that military and terrorist strikes tend to have short-lived shocks because they do not result in global recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
Adding to the uncertainty were increasingly hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He reiterated his call for a faster rake hike timeline and said the central bank's ""credibility is on the line"" in its battle against rising prices.
Recent data showed U.S. inflation at its hottest level in decades, ratcheting up concerns that the Fed could begin hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many had anticipated.
""The market is being felled by a combination punch, with Bullard's comments as well as increased rhetoric about the imminent invasion by Russia,"" Stovall added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 171.89 points, or 0.49%, to 34,566.17; the S&P 500 lost 16.97 points, or 0.38%, at 4,401.67; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.24 points, or 0%, to 13,790.92.
Ten of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed in negative territory, with energy stocks suffering the largest percentage drop. Consumer discretionary and communications services were the only gainers.
Fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the home stretch, with 358 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 78% have beat consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc are among the high profile companies posting results this week.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc advanced 1.8% after Chinese auto industry authorities announced the electric car maker sold nearly 60,000 China-made vehicles in January.
Drugmaker Biohaven shares rose 2.2% following positive topline trial results in the migraine treatment rimegepant.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) acquired the overseas marketing rights to the drug in November.
But Pfizer dropped 1.9%, joining other COVID vaccine makers in the red.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc tumbled 11.7% and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) dipped 1.3%.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, which on Monday submitted an application to Switzerland's drugs regulator for approval of its COVID vaccine, dropped 11.4%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 246 new lows.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 06:51PM ET</span>",Judge to dismiss Sarah Palin case against N.Y. Times regardless of jury verdict,"By Jody Godoy and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge said on Monday he will throw out Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, after concluding that an editorial in the newspaper did not maliciously link the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate to a mass murder.
In an abrupt twist in a trial seen as a test of longstanding protections for American media, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said Palin's lawsuit must be dismissed because she failed to show the Times acted with ""actual malice,"" the standard in lawsuits involving public figures.
The judge ruled on the trial's eighth day while jurors were still deliberating, and did not inform them of his plan. Rakoff said he plans to enter a formal dismissal only after jurors, who began deliberations on Friday, reach their own verdict.
Rakoff said he expected Palin to appeal, and that the appeals court ""would greatly benefit from knowing how the jury would decide it.""
His action effectively takes the case out of the hands of jurors. ""If you see anything in the media about this case, just turn away,"" Rakoff told them before dismissing them for the day.
Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Palin, 58, criticized Rakoff, while declining to discuss the outcome because deliberations were continuing.
""This is a jury trial, and we always thank jurors. We always appreciate the system,"" she said. ""So whatever happened in there kind of usurps the system that I believe we are used to, and respect, and works.""
In an email, Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha called Rakoff's action ""a reaffirmation of a fundamental tenet of American law: Public figures should not be permitted to use libel suits to punish or intimidate news organizations that make, acknowledge and swiftly correct unintentional errors.""
CHALLENGING SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT
Palin sued the Times and its former editorial page editor James Bennet over a June 14, 2017, editorial that incorrectly linked her to the January 2011 mass shooting that wounded Democratic U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords. 
She has said that if she lost at trial, her appeal might challenge New York Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing the ""actual malice"" standard for public figures to prove defamation.
Gautam Hans, a Vanderbilt University law professor, said Rakoff's order, while unusual, was reasonable and would likely survive any appeal.
""It is very difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in defamation cases,"" Hans said. ""That's one reason you see some antipathy toward the current state of the law, including from some Supreme Court justices.""
Two conservative Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have suggested revisiting the Sullivan decision.
Headlined ""America's Lethal Politics,"" the editorial addressed gun control and lamented the rise of incendiary political rhetoric.
It was written the same day as a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia where Republican U.S. congressman Steve Scalise was wounded.
One of Bennet's colleagues prepared a draft that referred to the January 2011 shooting in a Tucson, Arizona, parking lot where six people were killed and Giffords was wounded.
Bennet inserted language that said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" between the Giffords shooting and a map previously circulated by Palin's political action committee that the draft editorial said put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under crosshairs.
The Times corrected the editorial the next morning. Bennet testified that he made the additions too quickly under deadline pressure, and intended no harm to Palin.
'NOT ALTOGETHER HAPPY' 
Rakoff, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, said he was ""not altogether happy"" about ordering a dismissal, calling the original editorial ""an example of very unfortunate editorializing on the part of the Times.""
But the judge went on: ""My job is to apply the law. The law here sets a very high standard for actual malice, and in this case the court finds that that standard has not been met.""
Actual malice required a showing that the Times knew its editorial was false, or had reckless disregard for the truth.
Eric David, a media lawyer at Brooks Pierce in Raleigh, North Carolina, said a jury verdict favoring the Times would be ""much more appeal-proof"" because appeals courts are reluctant to second-guess jurors' factual determinations.
Palin was the late Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election.
That campaign made Palin a Republican Party star and hero to many conservatives who viewed her as an outsider willing to take on liberals and established institutions including the news media. She served as Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009. 

On the witness stand, Palin compared herself to the biblical underdog David against the Times' Goliath, while accusing the newspaper of trying to ""score political points.""
But she struggled under cross-examination to provide specific examples about how the editorial harmed her reputation and cost her opportunities.

BASRA/LONDON (Reuters) - A $27 billion deal between France's TotalEnergies and Iraq that Baghdad hoped would reverse the exit of oil majors from the country has stalled amid disputes over terms and risks being scrapped by the country's new government.
Iraq has struggled to attract major fresh investments into its energy industry since signing a flurry of post U.S.-invasion deals over a decade ago. The Iraqi government has cut oil output targets repeatedly as international oil companies that signed those initial deals leave due to poor returns from revenue sharing agreements.
TotalEnergies agreed last year to invest in four oil, gas and renewables projects in the southern Basra region over 25 years. The deal, signed by Iraq's oil ministry in September 2021, followed a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron.
The ministry, however, did not have agreement on the deal’s financial details with all the government departments that needed to approve it, three Iraqi oil ministry and industry sources involved or familiar with the negotiations told Reuters, and it has been mired in disputes ever since.
Following a parliamentary election, the deal now needs approval from a new Iraqi Cabinet, including new oil and finance ministers, who won't be in place until at least the end of March.
Iraq's oil ministry denied on Monday that there were any issues in implementing the agreement with TotalEnergies, saying in a statement that the deal ""needs time.""
Iraq expected the deal to be completed sometime from March onwards, an Iraqi oil ministry spokesperson told Reuters earlier.
TotalEnergies said it was progressing towards closing the deal but added, ""The agreements remain subject to conditions to be met and lifted by both sides.""
The terms, which have not been made public or previously reported, have raised concerns from Iraqi politicians, and according to sources close to the deal are unprecedented for Iraq.
A group of Shi'ite lawmakers wrote to the oil ministry in January demanding details of the deal and asking why it was signed without competition and transparency, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. 
Parliament could force the oil ministry to review or scrap the deal.
WAITING FOR $10 BLN
Under the draft terms, TotalEnergies is relying on getting $10 billion of initial investment to fund the wider project via oil sales from the Ratawi oilfield, one of four projects in the broader agreement, according to the sources.
The Ratawi field is already pumping 85,000 barrels of oil per day and rather than TotalEnergies receiving its share, the revenue is going into government coffers.
TotalEnergies is due to get 40% of the revenue from Ratawi's oil sales, Iraqi oil sources involved in negotiations told Reuters.
The Iraqi oil ministry said in its statement that agreements on TotalEnergies's financing under the deal still need to be made and are being negotiated.
That dwarfs the more usual 10-15% that investors would have received from past projects through Iraq’s technical service contracts, which reimbursed foreign companies for capital and production costs and paid a fixed remuneration fee in crude.
The higher the revenue-sharing proportion, the quicker and less risky the payback for investor.
Iraq's oil ministry officials argue the country needs to be competitive with other energy producing countries to lure big investors like TotalEnergies.
""We need to offer more incentives,"" a senior oil ministry official said.
TotalEnergies also has concerns about the deal. The French company has rejected having Iraq's National Oil Company (INOC) as its partner in the project, which is also delaying closing the deal, according to the two sources.
INOC is Iraq's reconstituted national oil firm, created to emulate firms such as the huge  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), but its legal status has yet to be fully cleared by Iraq’s new government and parliament, presenting a risk for TotalEnergies.
Iraq's oil production capacity has grown from 3 million to around 5 million bpd in recent years, but the departure of oil majors such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc from a number of projects due to poor returns means future growth is uncertain.
Developments have also slowed due to growing investor focus on environmental, social and governance criteria. Iraq at one time had targeted becoming a rival to top global producer Saudi Arabia with output of 12 million bpd or over a tenth of global demand.

Besides Ratawi, the deal with TotalEnergies consists of a 1 GW solar power plant, a 600 million cubic feet a day gas processing facility, and a $3 billion sea water supply project key to boosting Iraq’s southern oil production. 
The latter has also been hit by delays as Iraq's oil ministry decided in August last year that it wanted constructors to pay for the project, reversing a previous decision to short-list companies which would do it using state funds. It is still collecting bids for financing, sources say.

The Transportation Security Administration said in the week ending Feb. 13, it screened 24% fewer passengers than 2019 levels.
Airlines around the world are expressing optimism that travel will rebound this spring and summer as the Omicron variant's spread diminishes. 

Last month, U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines said a recovery in passenger traffic was likely to resume in March after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant.

Trian owned 237,384 shares of P&G, which makes Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, at the end of the fourth quarter after having sold 5 million shares. It owned 450,184 shares of Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Milka chocolate, on Dec. 31, after having sold 7.5 million shares, the filing showed.
The filing signals that Trian's engagement with both companies may be nearing an end.
So called 13-F filings require fund managers to detail the amount of stock they held in U.S. companies at the end of the previous quarter. While the filings are backward-looking, they are closely watched by investors for signs of investment trends.
Five years ago Trian asked for a board seat at P&G, beginning a fight that turned into the most expensive proxy fight to date at that time. Peltz was invited to join the board by P&G's chief executive in 2018 and the two men soon said publicly they were working collaboratively to improve operations and the company's stock price rose.
Peltz retired from the P&G board late last year.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA (OTC:BDORY) said in a filing on Monday that its 2022 net income is likely to rise by up to 23.7% from last year, despite a slower loan book growth.
Banco do Brasil forecast a recurring net income, which excludes one-off items, between 23 billion reais ($4.4 billion) and 26 billion reais this year, compared to 21 billion reais in 2021.
The bank indicated it plans to weather Brazil's dim growth outlook with good asset quality, higher net interest income, and sales of financial services.
Loan-loss provisions were estimated between 13 billion reais and 16 billion reais, versus 13.1 billion reais in 2021. Latin America's biggest economy is likely to post little or no economic expansion this year, hurting consumers and companies.
Loan book growth is also expected to slow down to between 8% and 12%, compared to 19.1% last year, mainly driven by rural loans and consumer lending.
The bank, however, said it expects to post a 4% to 8% rise in fee income, similar to forecasts from brick-and-mortar banks such as Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA last week.
Still, amid Brazil's surging inflation, operating costs are likely to go up by a similar percentage rise. In 2021, Banco do Brasil was able to tame inflation and post a rise of only 1.4% in expenses.
Banco do Brasil posted a 60.5% jump in fourth-quarter recurring net income from a year earlier to 5.900 bln reais, beating an average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv of 4.810 billion reais.
Profit was mainly helped by loan-loss provisions of 3.790 billion reais, down 26.5% from a year earlier. Its 90-day loan default ratio stood at 1.75%, slightly down from the previous quarter.
Net interest income - a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit cost - rose 4.5% from a year earlier, to 14.801 billion reais.

Its return on equity, a gauge of profitability, was 16.6%, up 2.3 percentage points from the previous quarter.

TIM's board on Monday discussed Labriola's standalone plan in response to KKR's 10.8 billion euro ($12.2 billion) approach, which the group's top shareholder, French media company Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), has said is too low. 
In a statement after the meeting TIM said the board acknowledged the CEO was pressing ahead with assessing potential strategic options for the group, including splitting its vertically integrated business.
The statement made no reference to KKR's proposal.
To set a benchmark to evaluate the bid, TIM is considering splitting its domestic business between an infrastructure entity and a services arm, to unlock value and facilitate a long-mooted merger of its fixed assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber.
Such a move would meet the favour of Italian state lender CDP, which controls Open Fiber and is TIM's second-largest investor with a 10% stake. CDP last month backed Labriola's appointment, which was sponsored by Vivendi.
Sources have previously said TIM is unlikely to take any firm stance on the KKR proposal before March 2, when the company's board is expected to approve the in-house revamp.
TIM on Monday also confirmed former Brazilian unit executive Adrian Calaza would take over the role of chief financial officer starting March 1.
New York-based KKR approached the telecoms operator in November, conditioning its offer to backing from TIM's management and Italy's government.
Under Labriola's plan, a so-called NetCo would include all of TIM's fibre and copper network infrastructure and submarine cable unit Sparkle, sources have said. The network company would assume a significant part of TIM's net debt and most of the group's 42,500 domestic staff.
The service company would focus on a large portfolio of products, from connectivity to cloud, and would include TIM's Brazilian operations, the same sources said. 
In a letter to Italian PM Mario Draghi on Monday, the country's leading unions emphasised their opposition to a TIM break up, saying a full-blown separation of the network business would put thousands of jobs at risk.

""As far as we are concerned, this remains a wrong option,"" the unions said.

The lawsuit accuses Facebook of capturing biometric information from photos and videos that users uploaded without consent, disclosing the information to others and failing to destroy it within a reasonable time.
""This is yet another example of Big Tech’s deceitful business practices and it must stop. I will continue to fight for Texans' privacy and security,"" Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. 
The lawsuit was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cited a person familiar with the matter as saying that the state was seeking hundreds of billions of dollars in civil penalties.
Asked about the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson said: ""These claims are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.""
The company said in a blog post in November that it was shutting down a facial recognition system and would delete more than a billion people's information. It cited concerns about use of the technology and uncertainty over what the rules are regarding its use.
It also agreed to pay $650 million in 2020 to settle an Illinois state lawsuit that dealt with similar concerns.

The new lawsuit, which was filed in a state court in Marshall, Texas, says that 20.5 million Texans have a Facebook account.
""The scope of Facebook's misconduct is staggering,"" the lawsuit said. ""Facebook repeatedly captured Texans' biometric identifiers without consent not hundreds, or thousands, or millions of times -- but billions of times,"" the lawsuit said.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 05:23PM ET</span>","As markets churn over Russia-Ukraine conflict, history shows fleeting impact","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over a potential Russian invasion into Ukraine could fuel stock weakness over the short-term, but most U.S. market fallout related to geopolitics is likely to be short-lived, if history is any guide. 
With the S&P 500 down over 7% to start the year and bond yields spiking, concerns about a hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve in its fight against surging consumer prices stand to remain at the forefront of investors' minds this year, even as developments overseas could rattle markets in the near term.
""The equity markets are more at risk from the fallout from the war on inflation than on a potential invasion of Ukraine,"" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, wrote in a note to investors. 
Stocks have been hit in recent days and investors have rushed to safe-haven assets amid rising worries over a potential conflict in Eastern Europe. On Monday, the S&P 500 last was down 1% in choppy trading.
Past ructions from geopolitical events have been comparatively fleeting, CFRA’s research showed. The firm analyzed 24 events since World War II, finding the S&P 500 fell on average of 5.5% from peak to trough in the aftermath of those events. 
The market took an average of 24 days from the start of the event to reach a bottom, but it recouped those losses in an average of 28 days later, according to Stovall. 
Truist Advisory Services, meanwhile, reviewed 12 historical events, including the 2003 Iraq War, 1979 Iranian hostage crisis and the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. The S&P 500 was higher a year after those events in nine of the 12 times, with an average gain of 8.6% – perhaps not surprising for an index that has gained about 4,000% since 1980. 
“When you look at the history of geopolitical events, they tend to have a short-term impact on the markets, and as long as they don’t drive you into recession, then the markets tend to rebound,"" said Keith Lerner, the firm's co-chief investment officer. 
""The conclusion is that we don’t think investors should overreact to this situation by itself.” 
Still, some on Wall Street worried the impact of a intensified Russia-Ukraine conflict could be longer lasting for some parts of the market. 

David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds, said a Russia invasion of Ukraine could be expected to drive up energy prices, while the prices of other commodities also could surge. Oil prices were at almost seven-year highs on Monday.
Higher energy prices were also on the mind of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Michael Wilson, who said a further spike could “destroy demand, in our view, and perhaps tip several economies into an outright recession.”

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slid on Monday while oil prices jumped to seven-year highs on U.S. warnings that Russia could soon invade Ukraine, and investors scurried to buy safe-haven government bonds they mostly shunned so far this year.
Europe's STOXX 600 share index tumbled as much as 3.0% and spot gold headed toward its biggest single-day gain in four months even as Russia suggested it was ready to keep talking to the West to defuse the crisis. 
The United States is relocating its embassy operations in Ukraine from the capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, citing the ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.""
Ukraine's government bonds slumped 10% to a crisis low even as Ukraine hinted at concessions to Russia. The appeal of save-havens lifted bullion and the Swiss franc. 
Markets in Europe were antsy. Major regional bourses fell about 2% and European natural gas prices for delivery in a month jumped nearly 10% to 81.30 euros per megawatt hour. (EU) 
The pan-regional STOXX 600 is 7% off an all-time high reached Jan. 4. Wall Street partially recovered from a late afternoon sell-off, with the Nasdaq closing flat. [.N]
U.S. stocks were already under pressure from inflation worries that were likley to prompt monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, said George Ball (NYSE:BLL), chairman of wealth manager Sanders Morris Harris.
Stocks face too many worries for any longer-lasting upward move, Ball said, adding that investors should increase cash to 10%-20% of their portfolios.
""Stocks have been premium priced for quite some time and a mixture of rising interest rates, military threats and the highest rate of inflation since 1980 makes a modest baby bear move in stocks likely in the near term,"" Ball said in a note.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.49%, the S&P 500 lost 0.38% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.24 points to close at break-even.
Last week, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard restated his call for a full one percentage point of rate hikes by July 1 in comments that helped spark a repricing of Treasuries. 
But on Monday Bullard said he would defer to Fed chair Jerome Powell about timing upcoming moves.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 4 basis points to 1.991%. Earlier they were above 2.0% before Ukraine tensions lifted prices, which move inversely to yield. 
The dollar index hit a two-week high as investors remained anxious over Ukraine and Bullard's comments. It later rose 0.366%, while the Russian ruble strengthened 0.91% to 76.21 per dollar.
The euro's retreat pushed the key euro-dollar implied volatility gauges to their highest since November 2020. The euro was unchanged at $1.1305.
""If it (the Russian invasion) happens, the question is how does it happen?"" said Jim Veneau at AXA investment managers. He said it could either be a conventional ""tanks roll forward"" military conflict or a more hybrid situation centered on cyber attacks.
But the Cold War era taught ""anything involving Russia and NATO, and you're only a couple of steps from a nuclear (buildup) escalation,"" he added.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.0% after paring steeper losses.
Markets have been in convulsions since an alarmingly high U.S. inflation reading last week sparked speculation the Fed might raise rates by a full 50 basis points in March and even raise rates before next month's meeting.
But U.S. short-term interest rate futures reflected a reduced chance of a rate increase before the Fed's two-day March policy meeting.
The Bank of Japan conducted an unlimited bond-buying offer on Monday to restrain Japanese debt yields.
The oil market cooled briefly on news of Ukraine's concessions offer, but climbed soon after.

U.S. crude futures settled up $2.36 at $95.46 a barrel, while Brent futures rose $2.04 to settle at $9.48 a barrel. 
Fear of a Russia-Ukraine conflict boosted bullion's safe-haven appeal. U.S. gold futures settled up 1.5% at $1,869.40 an ounce. Spot gold hit its highest level since Nov. 16 earlier in the session at $1,873.91.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) directors cited Fraser's ability to establish a clear set of priorities aimed at increasing long-term shareholder value among the reasons behind the compensation.
Fraser formally took the helm at Citi last February after being named as Mike Corbat's successor in 2020. She has been tasked with simplifying the bank's structure and getting its profitability on par with rivals.
Fraser was paid $17.1 million for 2020.
Citi had slashed Corbat's pay by 21% to $19 million for his final year in the job as the pandemic hit the bank's profits and shortcomings emerged in its risk controls.

Fraser's compensation is less than that previously announced for more experienced CEOs of other big banks, which are more profitable. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) head Jamie Dimon is receiving $34.5 million for 2021.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) CEO David Solomon and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gorman are both getting $35 million, while Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), is receiving $32 million.

Investing.com - Intuit cut its outlook on fiscal second-quarter revenue as performance was held back by a “slow forming tax season.”
 Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was down 2.8%.
The company, known for its TurboTax products and QuickBooks accounting tools, trimmed its fiscal second-quarter revenue outlook to a range of $2.66 billion and $2.67 billion from a prior range of $2.72 billion to $2.75 billion. That was below analysts’ estimates for revenue of about $2.73 billion.
The company said, however, it continued to expect revenue of between $12.17 billion and $12.3 billion for the fiscal year 2022, just shy of its Wall Street estimates for $12.34 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co on Friday told investors in Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) to vote against a planned takeover of Momentive Global, the parent of web-based survey portal SurveyMonkey, arguing the deal is too risky.
With both ISS and Glass Lewis coming out against the deal after a number of prominent shareholders also opposed it, chances are dwindling that the software company's shareholders will sign it off when they vote later this month.
""We believe Zendesk's proposed acquisition of Momentive could readily be characterized as a case of, 'ready, fire, aim',"" Glass Lewis analysts wrote in a note, adding, ""we recommend shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal.""
ISS wrote ""support for this proposal is not warranted,"" and noted there were so many questions about revenue synergies and financial projections that it ""had the potential to become that rarest of special situations, a merger that is disliked by shareholders of both the seller and the buyer."" 
Zendesk agreed to buy Momentive in October in an all-stock deal valued at roughly $4 billion. Investors, including activist hedge fund Jana Partners, quickly spoke out against the proposal, criticizing its financial merit and logic.
Glass Lewis agreed and wrote: ""We do not believe Zendesk investors — perhaps seeking some stability in the wake of the Company's seesawing quarterly performance — have been afforded persuasive reason to conclude the Company is well positioned to efficiently realize the lofty objectives underpinning the Momentive transaction.""
On Thursday, Zendesk said that it had received takeover interest of its own but had rejected a $127 to $132 a share bid from a group of private equity firms and wanted to push on with plans to buy Momentive.

Investing.com -- Stocks reacted with volatility to news coming out of Ukraine on Monday, first sounding conciliatory, then turning concerning and then easing off again.
Ukraine’s president put a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that announced a national holiday on Wednesday, suggesting that was the day the country expected Russia to initiate a military action. Russia has amassed more than 130,000 troops along its border with Ukraine.
But then posts on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) said the president’s comments weren’t intended to say that was definitive. Stocks had been wavering before the Facebook post, fell shortly after it became known, and then rebounded.
Earlier in the session, the talk focused on comments from Russia’s foreign minister that there was still time for a diplomatic solution to the tensions.
The Ukraine-Russia standoff has weighed on markets in recent days, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 500 points on Friday. Investors are also weighing the possibility of faster-than-expected rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC he’d like to see a 100 basis point rate hike by June.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Previous COVID-19 less protective against Omicron variant
The immune response to COVID-19 helps protect against reinfection, but that protection is weaker against Omicron than it was against earlier variants of the coronavirus, according to new data.
A previous SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against Omicron reinfection only 56% of the time, researchers found in a review of national data in Qatar. Having had COVID was 90.2% effective against reinfection with the Alpha variant, 85.7% effective against a Beta variant reinfection, and 92% effective against Delta reinfection, researchers reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
As was the case with reinfection due to earlier variants, however, ""the protection of previous infection against hospitalization or death caused by reinfection (with Omicron) appeared to be robust,"" they said. In cases of reinfection with Omicron, for example, the immune response to previous infection was 87.8% effective at preventing the second infection from progressing to severe or critical illness or death. 
mRNA vaccine booster protection declines within months
Protection provided by booster shots of the mRNA vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc or  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) starts waning quickly, according to data published in Friday's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Researchers reported that within two months after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine during the surge in infections caused by the Delta variant of the virus, vaccine efficacy was 94% against hospitalization and 92% against emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) visits. Efficacy waned thereafter, but climbed to 96% and 97%, respectively, at two months after a booster shot. Four months later, however, that protection had declined to 76% and 89%. Once Omicron became predominant, vaccine efficacy was 71% against hospitalization and 69% against ED/UC visits within two months after the second dose, 91% and 87% at two months after a booster, and 78% and 66% four months later. The estimates are drawn from analyses of 241,204 COVID-related ED/UC visits and 93,408 hospitalizations between August and January.

""Our findings suggest that additional doses (of vaccines) may be necessary,"" Brian Dixon of the Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University said in a statement. ""We also found that people who are Hispanic or Black are half as likely to have a third vaccine dose than people who are white, making (them) more vulnerable to severe COVID.""

Investing.com — Digital TV streaming device company  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) saw its shares decline Monday after Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter cut the price target on the shares to $220 from $365.
The analyst, who kept an outperform rating on the stock, praised its recent growth stating it ""did a phenomenal job growing its user base throughout the pandemic, and has increased monetization per user sufficiently enough to do so profitably. Roku continues to expand its active accounts – it added 1.25 million new users in Q3 and we expect another 3.1 million users were added in Q4.""
However, Pachter added that they think active account growth ""meaningfully decelerated"" over the second half of 2021 as its TV equipment manufacturer partners struggled to get TVs to market due to component shortages and supply chain disruption, alongside consumers spending more time out-of-home as lockdowns faded.
Nonetheless, the analyst justified the decision to keep an Outperform rating on the stock by saying they ""think that as the supply chain disruption lifts, perhaps early to mid-2022, user growth will reaccelerate."" 
""We adjust our target after the market has re-rated post-lockdowns, but we think the sell-off is over-done. We expect 35 – 40% annual EBITDA growth in the coming years, as the deceleration of active account growth and Roku-licensed TV sales is transitory,"" explained Pachter.
Roku shares are down 2% Monday, adding to recent losses, which have seen it fall 29.22% in 2022."
146,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 02:26PM ET</span>","Warburg, Sternlicht SPACs discuss $20-billion, three-way deal for Allied Universal","(Reuters) -Blank-check companies backed by buyout firm Warburg Pincus and billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht are in talks to take security services firm Allied Universal public in a $20 billion deal, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
The deal will involve three special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) - Warburg Pincus Capital Corp I-A, Warburg Pincus Capital Corp I-B and an affiliate of Sternlicht's JAWS Estates Capital LLC.
The SPACs are currently in talks to raise a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE), said the source, asking not to be identified as the information was private.
A representative for Warburg declined to comment, while JAWS Estates did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Allied Universal's unique agreement highlights how several SPAC sponsors are trying to come up with new structures and alternative funding sources, as the charm for blank-check deals fade.
Dealmaking in the SPAC market has been stifled by tightening regulatory scrutiny and high investor redemptions. A steep decline in share prices of some companies such as Grab Holdings Ltd and BuzzFeed Inc that went public through SPACs mergers has also soured sentiment.
Recently, a number of companies scrapped their agreements to go public via SPACs, including telecom services firm Syniverse Technologies, 3D printing firm Essentium Inc and travel technology platform HotelPlanner. 

The Allied Universal SPAC deal talks were first reported by Bloomberg News on Monday. Allied Universal, owned by private equity giant Warburg, provides integrated security services to help clients secure their businesses. 
SPACs are shell companies that raise capital through an initial public offering to merge with a private company, which then becomes publicly traded as a result.

By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George Soros bought nearly 20 million shares of electric truck startup Rivian Automotive Inc in the quarter ended Dec. 31, securities filings showed Friday. 
The 19,835,761 shares, worth about $2 billion at the time, makes Soros Fund Management among the most prominent investors in the company. Rivian, which is 20% owned by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is expected to provide the e-commerce company with more than 100,000 electric trucks. 

Irvine, California-based Rivian said in December it expected production to fall ""a few hundred vehicles short"" of its 2021 target of 1,200 due to supply chain constraints, highlighting the likely challenges in ramping up production to take on EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Shares of Rivian fell 9% Friday and are down 43% for the year to date. The stock price is down 67% from the high of $179.46 it touched on Nov. 16, less than a week after it raised $12 billion in the largest stock debut of 2021.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said on Monday it has finalized the purchase of  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) in a record chip industry deal valued at about $50 billion, giving it an extra edge in the key data center market. 
The closing of the deal comes on the heels of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's decision to abandon its plans to buy SoftBank-owned Arm Ltd, citing regulatory hurdles. 
AMD's transaction moved ahead with all necessary approvals for the acquisition, it said.
AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told Reuters that, between AMD's processor technologies and Xilinx's system on chips and field programmable chips, the two businesses are complimentary. ""That was our focus in talking to the regulatory authorities across the world,"" Su said. She added that Arm was an important partner for AMD but declined to say more about Arm's possible next steps.
The deal, announced in October 2020, was originally valued at $35 billion, but the rise of AMD's stock value has pushed up the price tag, according to AMD. 
AMD shares soared more than 4% on Monday. Other chip makers also gained.
With the Xilinx acquisition, Su said AMD will be able to increase its breadth in key markets like data centers where Xilinx has a strong network and AI presence, as well as in the 5G communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense markets. ""Those are all markets that AMD has had very little presence in and they all need high performance computing as well,"" she said.
AMD is intensifying its battle with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) in the data center chip market. The combined company will have more than 15,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).
The two U.S. companies have benefited from a more nimble approach to grabbing market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing.
AMD has long been Intel's chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business.

Su will lead the combined company as CEO, with Xilinx's CEO Victor Peng as president of the newly formed Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group. 
The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:51PM ET</span>",Apple given fourth Dutch fine in App Store dispute,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The Dutch antitrust watchdog fined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5 million euros ($5.7 million) again on Monday, its fourth such fine for failing to allow software application makers in the Netherlands to use non-Apple payment methods for dating apps on the App Store.
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has been levying weekly fines of 5 million euros on Apple since the company missed a Jan. 15 deadline to make changes ordered by the watchdog.
Apple's app-store payment policies, in particular its requirement that app developers exclusively use Apple's payment system with commissions of up to 30%, have come under scrutiny by antitrust officials and lawmakers in several countries, most recently the United States.
Apple asserts in posts on its websites that it has complied with the ACM's December order, which found it was abusing a dominant market position and had to change.
But the Dutch watchdog repeated on Monday that Apple had not complied, and was putting ""unnecessary and unreasonable"" conditions on dating app developers.
The ACM singled out a requirement that developers who want to use non-Apple payment methods must submit a new app to the App Store to do so, and then convince their customers to switch.
Apple, which says non-Apple payment methods pose a security risk, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), which represents developers including Tinder owner Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), said Apple's strategy is to delay reforming its app store as long as possible, and to figure out the minimal amount of reform antitrust officials will accept.
""Every year of delay is another $25 billion in revenue"" for Apple, said CAF representative Damien Geradin. ""Wouldn't you spend a couple of million on lawyers if you can go on for another couple of years?""
Apple on Jan. 15 said it had complied with the Dutch regulator's decision, but the regulator responded that the company had not made changes and had only said it would.
In a Feb. 3 statement Apple had described how developers could implement alternative payment methods, but the ACM said the company had not given it enough information to assess what had changed.
Apple says it still intends to charge a 27% commission on any in-app payments it does not process, only slightly below the 30% it charges on those it does process. 

An ACM spokesperson declined to comment on whether that is acceptable.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:50PM ET</span>",Ukraine's UIA loses insurance cover for some planes in Ukrainian airspace,"By Pavel Polityuk and Jamie Freed
KYIV (Reuters) - Two Ukrainian airlines disclosed problems in securing insurance for some of their flights on Monday while foreign carriers began avoiding the country's airspace as Russia masses a huge military force on its border.
Russia and Ukraine both hinted at fresh diplomatic efforts to avoid conflict on Monday, but Ukraine's biggest airline said its insurers had already terminated cover for at least some of its aircraft on flights inside Ukrainian airspace.
Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) said it had received the notification from its insurers as experts said more airlines were expected to avoid Ukraine's airspace after a U.S. warning that Moscow could invade its neighbour any time. 
""UIA is making efforts and is constantly negotiating with insurance companies, the ministry of infrastructure of Ukraine, the state aviation administration and hopes for mutual understanding,"" the Ukrainian airline said in a statement.
Low-cost carrier SkyUp, which had to divert a flight from Portugal on Saturday after the plane's owner barred it from entering Ukrainian airspace, said it had resumed selling tickets after an agreement with the Ukrainian government.
""Negotiations with insurers have been difficult and our foreign partners continue to regularly assess their own risks and monitor the situation,"" the airline said in a statement.
Neil Roberts, head of marine and aviation with the Lloyd’s Market Association, representing underwriters at the world's leading insurance market Lloyd's of London, said insurers told clients they could give just 48 hours notice to exclude Ukraine but that did not mean cover had been terminated.
""It means that there is an invitation to negotiate coverage. War risk insurance cover is being agreed in some cases on a rolling 24 hour or 48 hour basis, which is prudent,"" he told Reuters.
Trade sources said this would likely mean higher premiums.
Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal on Sunday said the government had allocated 16.6 billion hryvnia ($592 million) to ensure flight safety for insurance and leasing companies to guarantee continuation of flights through its airspace.
Airlines were drawing up plans on Monday for skirting around Ukraine, parts of which have been avoided since 2014, but officials said a far greater concern would be any impact on the use of Russian airspace in any tit-for-tat sanctions war.
AVOIDING AIRSPACE
Dutch airline KLM earlier said it would halt flights to Ukraine and through its airspace, while Germany's Lufthansa said it was considering a suspension.
British Airways (BA) flights between London and Asia on Monday appeared to be avoiding the airspace, according to Reuters monitoring of flight tracking service FlightRadar24.
The same website showed tracks of a U.S. Air Force Global Hawk intelligence-gathering military drone sweeping back and forth across the country from west to east on Monday.
UIA said that, at the request of aircraft leasing firms, five Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 had been flown to Spain, while two other planes had been sent to Serbia for scheduled maintenance. UIA has 25 planes in its fleet, according to its website.
Leasing firms control the majority of the world's fleet.
The situation for the rest of the airline's fleet was not immediately clear, while UIA asked passengers to closely follow its website for any news on the airline and its schedule.
A BA pilot said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Sunday there was a longer flight time for a freighter service from London to Bangkok because of ""current geopolitics"". BA did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
""My guess would be that Ukraine will become unavailable pretty soon if what we've seen over the weekend crystallises into a couple of more carriers actually pulling the pin,"" said Mark Zee, founder of flight operations association OPSGROUP. 
""I don't think it will be government advice that's doing it so much as it will be insurance-based unavailability or carriers looking at other carriers. So if you have KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways, for example, deciding not to overfly Ukraine at all, we're almost back into an MH17 scenario.""
Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board, two thirds of them Dutch citizens. Some airlines were already avoiding the airspace after military aircraft had been shot down.
Zee said avoiding Ukraine's airspace would have the biggest routing impact on airlines from neighbouring countries but was not expected to add much to the cost of long-haul flights.

News agency Interfax Ukraine said Ukrainian insurance companies had received a notification from reinsurers that airlines were not covered for war risks.

The firm, which offers its services to industries ranging from telecommunications to aerospace, expects a 2022 operating margin of 12.9% to 13.1% and revenue growth of 8%-10% at constant currency.
For 2021, it posted an operating margin of 12.9%, back at pre-pandemic levels, on revenue of 18.16 billion euros ($20.52 billion), up 15.1% at constant currency.
Capgemini said margin improvements would be reined in by salary inflation and as the company anticipates higher costs from the return of workers to the office and increased travelling, Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat said during a call. 
Europe's tech index has climbed about 32% in 2021, hitting all-time highs since the dot-com bubble in 2000, while Capgemini surged nearly 70% last year.
However, since the beginning of the year, the pan-European tech sub-index has dived 15% amid higher rate expectations and inflation concerns.

Capgemini a strong year in 2021 which was allowed by ""the acceleration of the digital transformation of large companies and organizations and investments (...) made in offerings"", Ezzat said.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:41PM ET</span>","Credit Suisse paid out millions despite compliance alert, drugs trial told","By Stephanie Nebehay
BELLINZONA, Switzerland (Reuters) - An ex-Credit Suisse manager told a Swiss court on Monday that millions of euros were paid out of accounts linked to a Bulgarian wrestler at the centre of an international drugs probe, despite the bank's legal compliance department being alerted.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and one of its former wealth managers face charges of letting an alleged cocaine trafficking gang launder millions of euros from 2004 to 2008 in the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland.
Switzerland's second biggest bank has rejected all the allegations and said there was no wrongdoing by its former employee in a case that has attracted intense interest in the country, where it is seen as a test for prosecutors taking a potentially tougher stance against its influential lenders.
State prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients through more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash, some of it stuffed into suitcases.
Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that the former Bulgarian wrestler, Evelin Banev, and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels. 
The former wealth manager, whose identity cannot be reported under Swiss privacy rules, last week told the Federal Criminal Court that she kept the bank's management fully informed of payments from Bulgarian customers' accounts after one of the alleged gang members was shot dead.
On Monday, one of her former supervisors in the bank's then 150-plus-strong eastern European section, told the court that bankers' awareness of money laundering had since changed.
""I think at that time, money laundering as a crime was something relatively new,"" the former Credit Suisse banker said, adding: ""I don't think it was an everyday topic of conversation among the front office but it was important.""
The banker was shown an email from late August 2007 he had received showing outflows worth 9.3 million euros ($10.5 million) had already taken place linked to the gang and another 4 million Swiss francs was set to be paid out only months after Bulgarian authorities launched a criminal inquiry into Banev and had informed Credit Suisse.
Banev does not face charges in Switzerland but was convicted in Italy of drug trafficking in 2017 and in Bulgaria in 2018 of money laundering. He was arrested in September in Ukraine as countries including Bulgaria and Romania sought his arrest.
In Sofia, his attorney said Banev denied any involvement in money laundering through Credit Suisse.
Two of his associates are charged in the Swiss case.
RISK APPETITE 
Credit Suisse, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source familiar with the bank's thinking said.
On Monday, the former Credit Suisse banker said his memory of events had faded, but that others in the Swiss bank were responsible for oversight.
""I honestly can't remember if I was informed about it, it's quite possible that I would have been,"" the former manager said, adding he would be ""very surprised"" if the bank had not alerted Swiss anti-money laundering authorities and blocked the accounts.
""I can say with some assurance that members of criminal organisations would not have been within the bank's risk appetite,"" he said. ""The source of wealth not being from a criminal background was, as I recall, important in 2007.""
Presented by prosecutors with media reports at the time, including one headlined ""Bulgarian businessman murder linked to Spanish cocaine"", the banker denied having seen them. 
He recalled the bank's culture and performance yardsticks.

""My performance would take into consideration whether revenues were stagnating or growing. And one of the ways to grow revenues or income is if you bring in more business. No bank likes to lose clients,"" he told the court.

(Reuters) - Leonardo DiCaprio-backed Polestar's ad taking a potshot at rivals Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) topped the list of the most popular commercials during Super Bowl LVI, new data on Monday showed.
The 30-second ad by the electric-car maker performed roughly 23 times better than other commercials aired during the game, according to consumer search data firm EDO, with its message of ""no epic voiceovers,"" ""no empty promises,"" and ""no hidden agendas"" aiming squarely at the idea of conquering Mars as well as the Volkswagen Dieselgate.
Five of the top 20 Super Bowl commercials that were the most searched online during and after the event were EV-focused and were made by Polestar, Kia, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Chevrolet and BMW, EDO said, highlighting the rising popularity of battery-powered vehicles in the U.S. market.
The number of electric vehicle-related TV ads have quadrupled in recent years to 33,000 in 2021 from 8,100 in 2019 and are on pace for another significant increase this year, according to the data firm. 
Polestar, which is owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is in the process of going public through a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Gores Guggenheim in the first half of 2022. 
Tesla boss Elon Musk responded with a laugh emoji on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), when one of his nearly 74 million followers pointed to the Polestar ad.
Tesla has been averse to spending on marketing, with Musk saying that he would rather use that money for product development.

Other hits this season were BMW's ad featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Salma Hayek Pinault and Nissan's 60-second action adventure ad with Eugene Levy.
The Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday to deliver a Hollywood ending to the Super Bowl, which gives brands the chance to get in front of the year's largest U.S. television audience.

Investing.com —  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock fell 2% on Monday after Cowen analyst Oliver Chen trimmed the price target on the stock to $265 from 300.
While Chen kept an outperform rating on the shares, he said in a note to investors that he is cautious because of data suggesting e-commerce traffic at Target ""meaningfully decelerated"" in the fourth quarter, on a two-year basis, indicating downside risk to estimates.
Chen explained that traffic at Target on a two-year basis slowed sequentially by 35 points to +19.6% from +54.8% in Q3, supporting other cautious data points around the quarter. 
However, over the longer-term, Cowen continues to favor Target as they ""believe the retailer will be better positioned to work through inflationary challenges over the coming quarters, benefits from a more resilient consumer, balanced category mix, broad-based market share growth, and trades at a more modest valuation.""
Chen also told investors that traffic ""modestly declined"" at Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), while he also slashed  Wayfair Inc  's (NYSE:W) price target after his review of their web traffic saw him cut his fourth quarter sales forecast by around 3%."

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers and countries could reach a deal by the end of June on proposed tech rules forcing online platforms to better police the internet despite differences in their approach, the lawmaker steering the negotiations said on Monday.
The Digital Services Act (DSA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager forces Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms or face fines up to 6% of global turnover.
The first of its kind in the world, Vestager's proposal needs to be agreed by EU countries and lawmakers before it can become law.
""I am optimistic we can make a deal before the end of June,"" lawmaker Christel Schaldemose said in an interview.
Her comments came ahead of talks with French Digital Affairs Minister Cedric O and EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Tuesday, their second meeting on the issue. A third is scheduled for March 15.
Schaldemose said lawmakers want to expand the scope of what online platforms have to do, ban dark patterns which mislead people into giving personal data to companies online, and continue to let companies be regulated where they are based.
""We go into the business models of platforms. The Council is not so willing to go that far,"" she said, citing the divergence on dark patterns.
""The Council wants the ban only for online marketplaces. Parliament wants a ban on all platforms.""
Schaldemose said countries like Ireland, where Apple, Facebook and Google have their European headquarters, and Luxembourg, where Amazon is based, should continue to supervise the companies in line with the ""country of origin"" principle.

""We stick closer to the country of origin principle than the Council,"" she said, adding that the European Commission could also have a say, while EU countries want a bigger role for the EU executive.
EU lawmakers also want a ban on targeted advertising for minors and also that based on sensitive data like sexual or political orientation in order to comply with the bloc's privacy rules, while EU countries collectively have a less strict position.

(Reuters) -European shares ended at their lowest level in 20 days on Monday, with travel and banking leading the slump as investors fretted over geopolitical risks following warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time. 
The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index fell 1.8% - its worst single-day fall since Jan. 24. All the major sub-sectors were in the red.
Banking shares led declines, down 3.3% after sovereign bond yields across the euro area fell as investors rushed back to safe-haven debt on Russia-Ukraine tensions.
However, Ukraine hinted at possible concessions to Russia, helping alleviate some friction between the two countries, while Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested to President Vladimir Putin that Moscow continue on diplomatic paths.
Global investors dumped riskier assets and moved to safe-havens such as gold and government bonds after a warning from the United States that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time.
""When it comes to the Russian issue, it is very difficult to say whether the markets are overreacting or not,"" Matt Siddle, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said.
""You've two big uncertainties. It's not entirely clear what the Fed policy is. It's a tightening policy, but it's not clear how far and quick they're going to go, and there's also geopolitical uncertainty with Russia.""
A gauge of volatility in European equities spiked to 30.05 points - its highest since Jan. 25 when global markets sold off on concerns over higher interest rates and valuations in the technology sector. 
Some of the Russian-exposed European banks including Raiffeisen Bank International, Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) fell between 4.2% and 6.1%. 
Airlines were also hit hard, with shares of WizzAir, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), Germany's Lufthansa and Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) down between 3.3% and 6.3%.
Dutch airline KLM, part of Air France, said on Saturday it will stop flying to Ukraine, while Lufthansa was considering suspending air traffic in Ukraine.
The STOXX 600 has fallen 5.5% so far this year, while New York's S&P 500 is down 7.5% as fears around quicker U.S. rate hikes and geopolitical concerns knocked investor confidence. Both the indexes started the new year at record highs. 

Among other stocks, Clariant slumped 16% to the bottom of STOXX 600, as the Swiss speciality chemicals group delayed the release of its 2021 results due to an investigation into accounting issues.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) fell 2.7% after Germany's finance minister said the government would not keep its stake in the lender in the long run.

San Francisco (Reuters) -Intel Corp's Mobileye (F:0ME) unit plans to build and deploy self-driving electric shuttle vehicles with its partners in the United States in 2024, in a bid to scale up its automated driving systems beyond taxis and delivery vehicles, executives told Reuters. 
Mobileye, Benteler EV Systems and Beep will launch the on-demand driverless shuttles, which will feature 12 to 14 seats and no steering wheel or pedal.
The shuttles will be operated in ""contained geo-fenced areas"" where speed limits are 35 miles an hour or less, Hinrich Woebcken, advisory board member for Beep, a mobility service provider, said. 
They expect to have a couple of hundred of the vehicles on U.S. roads in the first year of their deployment, with a goal to boost the number to between 10,000 and 15,000 globally, the executives said. 
Mobileye plans to deploy robotaxis in Israel and Germany by the end of this year pending regulatory approval. It is also working with Silicon Valley startup Udelv to put automated electric delivery vehicles into service in the United States by 2023. 
Mobileye will prove to U.S. federal and state regulators that its self-driving system would be safer than a human driver, said Johann Jungwirth, vice president of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) at Mobileye. 
""On a technology perspective, we feel very, very bullish and very strongly that the technology is actually close to being ready,"" he said. 
The executives said shuttles will help save on driver costs and address driver shortages, as well as addressing urban problems such as emissions and congestion.

""We see the interesting opportunities and growth of this autonomous mover, autonomous shuttle market. So we see it as a blue ocean,"" Marco Kollmeier, managing director of Benteler EV Systems GmbH, said. 
Benteler EV Systems, part of German automotive parts group Benteler International AG, will build the shuttles that meet automotive industry and safety standards for public roads.

The announcement saw the company's shares initially climb to a high of $12.83 at the open, but they have since given up those gains and more, currently trading down 1.3%.
The news follows the company receiving promising data from early human testing. Data from an ongoing early-stage trial shows that if taken twice daily, the pill, PBI-0451, can trigger antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and any of its emerging variants.
Pardes said no serious adverse events were reported, with only mild side effects, which were resolved quickly. The company added that the drug was well tolerated during trials.
The drug is in the same class of medicine as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s nirmatrelvir, which is designed to prevent coronavirus replicating in human cells.
""We are highly encouraged by these initial Phase 1 observations, which support continued development of PBI-0451 as a potential stand-alone antiviral therapy for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections,"" said Uri Lopatin, chief executive officer of Pardes."

The company expects its segment operating profit to rise to more than 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion), above the 3.01 billion euros recorded in 2019 and in line with its earlier vows to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022.
The recovery will however vary across markets. ""Some markets will be above 2019, (but) for example the original equipment market for vehicles might not be back yet at 2019 levels,"" Chief Finance Officer Yves Chapot told Reuters.
Michelin makes tyres within three main segments - passenger cars, trucks, and specialty vehicles such as agriculture, mining equipment or plane tyres. 
This year, the firm forecasts light truck tyre market growth of 0%-4%. The truck tyre market is seen increasing by 1%-5%.
""(Light truck) replacement markets are back at 2019 levels... the original equipment will still be perturbed for sure during the first half-year, and will probably rebound only within the second half, and maybe the last quarter of the year,"" Chapot said. 
Specialty tyres, Michelin's most resilient segment, should grow by 6%-10%, helped again by mining and agriculture but also a recovery in the aircraft tyre market. 
The company's sales last year rose more than 16% year-on-year to 23.80 billion euros, above the highest point of the analysts' forecast range it provided. Its operating profits rose to 2.97 billion euros, roughly in line with expectations.
""The overall yearly results have improved mostly thanks to three triggers,"" Chapot said, pointing to volumes - which were however still 4.5% below 2019 levels - price increases and product mix improvement, and integration of companies acquired since 2018.
""(Last year) we faced 1.2 billion euros of inflators, partly in raw materials, and (factors) outside raw materials such as energy, transportation, maritime shipping,"" Chapot said.
The company expects similar inflationary pressures in 2022, with an aim to hedge them with the price and mix effect as it did last year, he added.
Michelin's exposure to recent tensions stemming from the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, from where it imports some raw materials, was limited, Chapot said.

The company does not expect any short-term impact on its activities from the recent truck driver protests in Canada, he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Noom Inc reached a $62 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing the weight loss app provider of tricking customers into signing up for ""risk-free"" trial periods only to force them into automatic, costly renewals that were difficult to cancel.
The preliminary settlement filed on Friday night in Manhattan federal court calls for Noom to pay $56 million in cash and offer $6 million of subscription credits.
Court approval is required.
Noom also made changes to its business practices that the company and the customers' lawyers valued at between $31.2 million and $120 million.
Noon was accused of extracting up to eight months of nonrefundable payments totaling as much as $199 once its trial periods expired, saddling some customers with weight-loss services they never intended to buy.
The New York-based company denied wrongdoing, and said its disclosures and cancellation process complied with the law.
In a blog post founders Saeju Jeong and Artem Petakov said the settlement ""allows us to focus our energy on delivering the best possible health outcomes for our Noomers.""
The plaintiff class includes people who bought automatically renewing Noom Healthy Weight subscriptions from May 2016 to October 2020 and did not receive refunds.
Individual payouts are expected to be approximately $30 to $167 per person.
The settlement ""provides excellent monetary and programmatic relief for Noom's customers,"" their lawyer J. Burkett McInturff, a partner at Wittels McInturff Palikovic, said in an email.

Lawyers for the customers may seek legal fees of up to one-third of the settlement fund.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 3.8% higher Monday as Piper Sandler analyst Alexander E. Potter raised the price target to $1,350 from $1,300.
The shares popped even as sales of the company’s China-made vehicles fell 15% month-on-month.
The new price target is 51% higher than the stock’s current level of $892.
Potter continues to be overweight on the stock. He said the brokerage is focusing on five key topics in assessing the stock -- namely deliveries, gross margin, operating expenditure, software and cash flow.
He expects the world’s most valuable automaker to make 1.58 million deliveries in 2022, a 69% growth on top of 936,222 units delivered in 2021.
According to reports, while the analyst believes Tesla's gross margin ""was a success story"" in 2021, this year is hard to predict. Potter says Tesla's cash flow shields it from macro uncertainty.
Tesla’ gross operating margin jumped more than 4 percentage points to 25.3% in 2021.
Model Y is the biggest near-term growth driver, while the chip supply is the limiting factor, Potter wrote in his report.
According to data by China Passenger Car Association, Tesla sold 59,845 China-made vehicles in January compared to 70,847 of them in the previous month.
In comparison, Chinese rival Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) delivered over 10,000 vehicles for the fifth straight month, recording 12,922 deliveries in January. Nio (NYSE:NIO) delivered 9,652 vehicles in the month, up 34% year-over-year. Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) delivered 12,268 Li ONEs, a 128% jump year-on-year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp said Monday it has not yet resumed production at its three manufacturing lines in Ontario even after a key U.S.-Canadian bridge reopened.
The Japanese automaker's plants in Ontario, where it builds its best-selling RAV4 sport utility vehicle, have halted production since Thursday because of parts shortages stemming from the border disruption from a protest by Canadian truckers. 
Toyota said it expects ""related disruptions to continue this week"" in Ontario. Toyota also said its plants in West Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama are still facing production impacts on Monday.
Police in Windsor late Sunday cleared the Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade route to Detroit, peacefully two days after the province of Ontario declared a state of emergency and the city got a court injunction to end the protest. 

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which both reported production disruptions because of the bridge blockade last week, said plants were operating normally on Monday. Ford said last week a plant in Ohio that was forced to halt production on Friday would be closed this week for a separate supply chain issues -- a lack of semiconductor chips.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's financial watchdog said on Monday it had told four 'buy now pay later' firms (BNPL) to change their contracts after identifying ""potential harms"" to consumers.
BNPL firms, which are unregulated, typically offer on-the-spot interest-free short-term loans that spread payments for retail goods like clothing.
The market more than trebled in size during 2020 to 2.7 billion pounds ($3.65 billion), when COVID-19 lockdowns saw more people struggling to make ends meet.
""The four firms involved, Clearpay, Klarna, Laybuy and Openpay, have fully cooperated with our work. We welcome their cooperation and their actions to address our concerns,"" the Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement.
While unable to regulate BNPL firms, the watchdog said it was able to use Britain's consumer rights laws to make their contracts fairer, easier for consumers to understand and better reflect how they use them in practice.
Klarna said it had already implemented the FCA's proposed changes.
""We have never received a customer complaint specifically related to our terms and conditions but are always open to ways in which they can be improved,"" said Alex Marsh, Head of Klarna UK.
The watchdog said that all firms in the sector should comply with all requirements of consumer protection laws that apply to their business.
One of the terms that involved late payment fees has resulted in Clearpay, Laybuy and Openpay agreeing to voluntarily refund customers who have been charged such fees in specific circumstances, the FCA said
Laybuy said it has worked hard to simplify its contract terms to make sure they are fair, transparent and easy to understand.
Clearpay said a very small group of customers may have incorrectly been charged a late fee, and it will automatically refund affected customers it is able to identify.
Openpay did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A review by former FCA acting CEO Christopher Woolard in February 2021 said BNPL can pose potential consumer harms https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/woolard-review-report.pdf that need to be addressed as soon as possible.
Britain's finance ministry promised to bring forward legislation to regulate BNPL when parliamentary time allowed.
StepChange, a charity which helps people cope with debt, said the FCA's intervention was not a substitute for regulation to bring the sector under the watchdog's rulebook.

The FCA said it will consult on rules for BNPL after the government has decided which firms and activities will be regulated.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Jana Partners cut its holding in Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) by 84% in the last months of 2021 not long after the activist investment firm prodded the retailer to consider alternatives for its online unit, according to a regulatory filing.
The New York-based hedge fund reported on Monday that it owned 760,780 shares in Macy's at the end of the fourth quarter on December 31, 2021. That compares with 4.6 million shares the hedge fund owned at the end of the third quarter. The firm's holding at the end of September amounted to 1.5% of the company.
The filing, called a 13-F filing, comes 45 days after the end of the quarter and details what money managers owned in U.S. stocks at the end of the quarter. While the filing is backward looking, it is often closely watched for signs of investment trends or what prominent firms like Jana Partners are thinking.
The filing gives no explanation for any moves and Jana Partners declined to comment.
In October Jana Partners first presented its case for Macy's at an investment conference in New York and then followed up with a letter to the company's board, pushing for management and the board to consider alternatives for the fast growing online unit.

Jana Partners argued that the e-commerce business could be worth a multiple of Macy's market valuation, which has risen to $7.6 billion from $6.9 billion when Jana made its first presentation.
Macy's announced in November that it is working with AlixPartners to review its business structure and Macy's CEO said on an earnings call that ""(we) recognize the significant value of the market assigning to pure e-commerce businesses.""

Investing.com — Shares of Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) rose around 2% at the open Monday on the back of comments from BofA analyst Omar Dessouky, who described the company as a ""category leader.""
Roblox is an online game platform and a game creation system considered a leader in the metaverse media sector.
Dessouky reinstated a buy rating on the stock with an $84 price target, saying “Roblox is the category leader and is concretely demonstrating for consumers, developers, and merchants what the term means.""
The analyst noted that while other online media companies sponsor their own metaverses, Roblox has no “old media” businesses to cannibalize, and it invests 100% of its resources towards leadership on eight well-defined metaverse criteria. 
Dessouky added that the metaverse category could eventually subsume parts of social media, streaming video and video games, and revenue streams from advertising and e-commerce. 
""Roblox could eventually encompass more than today’s investors can conceive,” he stated, concluding that it is ""comparable to the early years of now dominant platforms."""

In a press briefing to present a new three-year strategy, Chief Executive Gian Maria Mossa said large tie-ups with other players would be complicated by the company - the wealth management arm of Italy's top insurer Generali - having, for example, different distribution models to its peers. 
""At this stage, I do not see room for transformational deals,"" he said.
Financial services group Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) in late 2020 considered swapping its 13% stake in Generali with Banca Generali but put the deal on hold due to COVID-driven market volatility, a source familiar with the matter said at the time.
Nonetheless, analysts consider consolidation in the wealth management industry as inevitable.
During the briefing, Mossa said he was ""happy"" he could count on the strength of Generali's brand.
Banca Generali said it planned to pay out between 7.5 and 8.5 euros per share in total dividends over the three years to 2024 as it aims to attract new clients with personalised products, and boost digitisation and sustainability.
The asset manager, which mainly offers personal finance services, expects total net inflows of between 18 billion and 22 billion euros through 2024, as well as 10-15% growth in net profit each year. 
It also committed to reach net zero emissions by 2040. 
Banca Generali last week posted a record full-year net profit and said it would distribute a dividend of 1.95 euros per share on 2021 results.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed to lower on Monday, as fresh warnings from Federal Reserve officials over the pace of monetary tightening took the steam out of a relief rally that followed comments suggesting that war between Russia and Ukraine isn't imminent.
Futures had pared their overnight losses after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told President Vladimir Putin that there was still a way forward for diplomatic engagement. That followed a sternly worded warning from G7 Finance Ministers threatening ""massive and immediate"" consequences for the Russian economy if it sends its military across the border. Russian warships are currently closing off a large part of Ukraine's coastline with what it says are naval drills.
However, comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard ensured that the market's focus remained on the prospects for inflation and interest rates this year. Bullard, who last week said he wanted official rates to rise by a full 100 basis points by the start of July, told CNBC that: “I do think we need to front-load more of our planned removal of accommodation than we would have previously. We’ve been surprised to the upside on inflation.""
Earlier, The Wall Street Journal had reported Kansas City Fed President Esther George repeating her view that the Fed needed to start selling down its $9 trillion bond portfolio as a way of tightening monetary policy without resorting to too many official rate hikes. Richmond Fed chief Tom Barkin meanwhile had told Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) radio that the Fed's reaction function would depend largely on what happens to service prices, which had shown signs of inflation pressure broadening to include a much greater cross-section of services in the last two months. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 120 points, or 0.4%, at 34,618 points. The S&P 500 was flat however while the NASDAQ Composite, which had underperformed on the way down during Friday's rout, was up 0.3%.
The market had appeared set to open still under the shadow of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey, which had shaken confidence in the strength of U.S. consumption on Friday. The survey's main index had fallen to its lowest level since 2012 on a combination of high inflation and the fading effects of pandemic-era stimulus.
""Spending and sentiment are not the same, especially when households are sitting on trillions of dollars of pandemic savings, but it’s hard to be very positive about the near-term outlook for retail sales when sentiment has fallen so far, so quickly,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson in a note to clients.
It was a quiet start to the week on a micro level.  Advance Auto Parts  (NYSE:AAP) stock fell 1.4% despite reporting earnings ahead of expectations, while defense giant  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock fell 1.9% after bowing to regulatory pressure and dropping its bid for rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD). Rocketdyne stock fell 3.9% but had already fallen some 20% in expectation that the deal would fail. The development is the latest sign of the Biden administration taking a more aggressive line in stopping industrial concentration, and follows similar resistance to mergers in sectors as diverse as chipmaking and railroads.
One of the few stocks making outsize moves was south-east Asian multi-app company Sea. Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE) ADRs fell 14% after the government of India banned its Garena Free Fire game for download owing to security concerns and the Chinese origins of the game's code. Free Fire accounts for some 10% of Sea's gaming revenue according to some estimates, but gaming in general - and the optimistic assumptions built into its further growth - have been a key part of Sea's valuation."

Investing.com – Shares of  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) traded slightly weaker on Monday amid renewed hopes of a diplomatic solution to the ongoing tensions along the border of Russia and Ukraine.
Exxon fell 1.7% while Chevron fell 2.1% as crude prices eased amid signs of a concession by Ukraine to Russia, though a final word isn’t out on it yet. Various American and European government officials have said the Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen any time now.
According to Bloomberg, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “All right” in response to Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s suggestion talks with the U.S. and its allies on its demands for security guarantees in Europe should continue. Russia also wants a ban on further expansion of NATO.
Later, Putin met Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who reported that some of the massive military exercises now underway are already concluded. He didn’t specify plans for returning the troops to their bases, but other officials have said they will go back once the operations are over.
The comments indicate Kremlin will continue diplomatic efforts to ease tensions and may even begin to de-escalate.
The U.S. has demanded Russia pull back some 130,000 troops it says the latter has massed near the border with Ukraine.

In November, Bluebell asked Glencore to separate the unit to allow more investors to buy the stock, but Glencore Chief Executive Officer Gary Nagle had then said none of its major shareholders were asking for a spin-off.
In the letter dated Jan. 24, London-based Bluebell set out a plan for Glencore to separate its coal company with A and B shares. 
Thermal coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and other major mining companies, including Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), have sold or spun off their coal assets as they ramp up focus on greener initiatives. 

Thermal coal prices, however, are close to all-time highs hit last year on expectations of a continued shortage of energy supply.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, has expanded into areas including electric vehicles (EVs) and semiconductors in recent years.
In a statement, Foxconn said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with oil-to-metals group Vedanta to make semiconductors, calling it ""a significant boost to domestic manufacturing of electronics in India.""

According to McCarthy, “where the magic lives” at Peloton is on its digital screens and not its connected bikes or treadmills.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Airbus voiced optimism on Monday about sales of a new A350 freighter after Boeing (NYSE:BA) launched a competing cargo version of its future 777X jetliner and said it was doing everything possible to shore up fragile global supply chains.
Airbus launched the freighter version of its A350 wide-body jet last year to address rising air cargo demand and penetrate a profitable part of the jet market dominated by Boeing, which hit back with a 777X freighter launch order from Qatar Airways. 
""Yes, you can expect to see more orders for the A350 freighter,"" Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said ahead of the Singapore Airshow which runs from Feb. 15-18, but declined to elaborate.
Provisional customers for the A350 freighter include Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) which could confirm a provisional order to coincide with this week's air show, delegates said.
The airline signed a tentative deal in December to buy seven A350 freighters and become its first major airline operator.
But the deal also involves dropping previous orders for 15 A320neo jets and two A350-900 passenger versions. Both Airbus and Boeing have agreed to convert some passenger plane orders in order to secure wins for their new twin-engined freighters.
Scherer declined comment on a dispute with Qatar Airways which has led the Gulf carrier to refuse to consider buying the A350 freighter and back Boeing's 777X cargo version. 
It has also placed a provisional order for at least 25 Boeing 737 MAX jets, after Airbus revoked an order for A321neos as part of the same dispute over surface damage to A350 jets.
Scherer played down industry concerns over supply chains when asked whether Russian titanium could be swept up in any tit-for-tat sanctions resulting from tensions over Ukraine.
""Fundamentally, we are not concerned about the structural issue,"" Scherer said. 
Industry sources have said Airbus and Boeing have increased stocks of the strategically important metal, of which Russia is the largest producer.
PRODUCTION PLANS
Asked whether broader supply chain problems could also hamper Airbus' plans to increase jetliner production, he said, ""we are doing everything we can for that not to be the case.""
Boeing also indicated on Monday it was not concerned about Russian titanium supplies, but said it was keeping a close watch on other pinch points.
Concerns over the Ukraine crisis hit European shares on Monday, with Airbus down 3% and major airlines falling 6%.
Planemakers are gathering for Asia's largest aerospace event, whose attendance has been hit by COVID-19 restrictions. 
Airbus said it had firmed up previously tentative orders for 20 A220 small jets from leasing company Aviation Capital Group, a subsidiary of Tokyo Century Corp, and 28 A320neos from Kuwaiti carrier Jazeera Airways.
Airlines have been rushing to buy such jets again as some markets recover, though long-haul travel remains depressed.
Analysts say one exception has been China, which has been notably quiet as U.S.-China trade tensions cast a pall over its demand for Boeing jets, spilling over to affect demand for Airbus as planners avoided all politically sensitive purchases.
Scherer noted the risk that China could miss out on available airplanes as other airlines fill the gap. Usually China accounts for about a quarter of global purchases.
""We are still hopeful to be able to include additional transactions by Chinese customers,"" Scherer said.

""Notwithstanding the pandemic crisis, we've continued to sell very successfully...so there's a lot of pressure now on our friends in China to come to the party or run the risk of seeing not enough capacity to satisfy their needs. But I remain optimistic that China will come back to an ordinary cycle.""
Airbus also hopes China will soon certify its A220 jet.

(Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries is investing $200 million in Glance, a lock screen content company backed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and owned by ad-tech firm InMobi, to bring the service to new Jio smartphones this year, the companies said on Monday.
The investment, made through Reliance's Jio Platforms unit, values Glance at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion post-money, according to a source involved in the deal. 
The integration will allow Reliance's retail businesses to advertise products directly to Jio users through Glance, a platform that delivers personalised news, entertainment content and live videos to smartphone lock screens.
Glance could be on ""hundreds of millions"" of Jio phones this year, InMobi Group founder and Chief Executive Officer Naveen Tewari said in a phone interview. 
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance launched its Jio Phone Next on Nov. 4 but sales figures have not been publicly disclosed.
Ambani has been steadily buying stakes in consumer internet firms and tying those services into Reliance Jio, as he looks to create a technology behemoth that incorporates connectivity, content and commerce. 
""The deal is also expected to lead to further strategic collaborations between Glance, Reliance Retail and Jio across devices, commerce, content and gaming ecosystem,"" InMobi said in a statement.
Glance is available on default in 60% to 65% of new smartphones sold in India, thanks to tie-ups with Samsung (KS:005930), Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Vivo, Oppo and Realme, Tewari said. 

It will use the fresh funds to expand to U.S. and Latin American markets, and is also testing new ways of content-driven commerce through live videos. 
The company is backed by Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital and Alphabet, which invested $100 million in December 2020.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Volatility soared across markets on Monday, with a gauge of potential swings in the euro-dollar exchange rate at the highest since November 2020 and a key measure of equity swings rising to the highest in more than two weeks.
Markets took fright late on Friday after a U.S. warning that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could come ""any day"". On Sunday the United States said Russia might create a surprise pretext for an attack.
Stock markets fell heavily on Monday and Wall Street was tipped for a weaker start, while oil prices headed towards $100 a barrel. Assets such as government bonds and the Swiss franc caught a bid.
The VIX equity volatility measure -- often known as Wall Street's 'fear gauge' -- rose to the highest since Jan. 28 at 32 points (VIX), having fallen below 20 points last week. Its European counterpart hit its highest since Jan. 24 to trade above 33 points.
A one-month volatility gauge for Germany's DAX index, particularly vulnerable to an escalation in the conflict due to its constituent companies' reliance on Russian gas, rose above 39 points for the first time since November 2020. It was last up 16 points on the day at 38.2.
The volatility surge enveloped currency and bond markets too, with euro-dollar one-month implied volatility at 7.6%. It had been below 6% at the end of January.
As the euro fell against the safe-haven Swiss franc, euro-franc one-month implied volatility jumped to 5.7%, the highest since May 2020.
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) index of G10 currency volatility rose to 7.5%, the highest since February 2021 , while BofA's gauge of bond market volatility closed Friday at a multi-year high of 94 points.
Aside from the threat of a war that squeezes oil supply and hits economic growth, central bank policy has been an added source of volatility for markets. Inflation at record- or multi-year highs is fanning speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve could opt for an aggressive front-loaded rate-hike cycle and that the European Central Bank could also raise interest rates this year.
UBS Global Wealth Management noted market swings had been on the rise since the start of the year, while COVID-19 concerns had ebbed. ""Volatility remains elevated as a result of repeated upward surprises in U.S. inflation data and growing concerns in Eastern Europe,"" it said.

At the close on Friday, Splunk was valued at $18.18 billion. The bid was made recently but the companies aren’t currently in active talks, The Wall Street Journal said.
Splunk makes software used by companies’ information technology and security operations to monitor and analyze data.
Cisco has traditionally derived the bulk of its revenue from selling routers, switches and security services but is now trying to build a suite of applications to grow its software business.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 07:35AM ET</span>",Toshiba sets March 24 for preliminary vote on break-up plan,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp plans an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on March 24, to seek their initial approval to hive off its devices business, the company said on Monday. 
The final, legally binding vote to determine whether to break up the 146-year-old conglomerate will not happen until next year, but next month's meeting will be a key gauge of shareholder support for the board's restructuring plan.
Toshiba's plan has been criticised by some foreign hedge funds with stakes in the company.
Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners has submitted a separate proposal for the meeting, urging Toshiba to explore other options and solicit buyout offers from private equity firms and potential strategic buyers.
The company is opposed to 3D's proposal.
The board chose the break-up plan over buyouts after a thorough review that involved talks with private equity firms over conditions and pricing for a potential deal to take the company private, Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.
If the breakup plan failed to win majority support, however, all options will be considered, including a deal to take the company private, Tsunakawa said.
Such a deal is seen as a potentially greater windfall for shareholders, including the foreign activists that now own nearly 30% of the company.
Reuters has reported that Toshiba walked away from potential private equity buyout offers at a substantial premium, as well as advanced talks for a minority stake from Canada's Brookfield.
The proposals of both the board and 3D would need approval from just over half of shareholders.
This month, Toshiba proposed to split off the business that includes its power chips and hard disk drive units, rejigging an earlier plan to break into three companies - one each for devices, its energy and infrastructure businesses and another for its Kioxia flash memory chip assets.
Sources at several shareholders told Reuters they saw the changes as simply a way for Toshiba management to skirt investor opposition, although the company has repeatedly denied this.
The previous three-way breakup plan, which envisaged offloading of a much larger share of assets, would have required approval from two-thirds.
Toshiba posted on Monday an operating profit of 42.7 billion yen ($369.85 million) for the October-December quarter, up from 20.9 billion yen a year earlier.
But it trimmed its full-year profit forecast by 9%, to 155 billion yen, blaming soaring costs of materials and semiconductor shortages.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>",A new Onassis? Italy's sea captain swoops on reborn Alitalia,"By Jonathan Saul, Elisa Anzolin and Francesca Landini
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Sixty-five years after Aristotle Onassis founded Greece's Olympic Airways, another shipping entrepreneur is planning to take to the skies - this time in Italy, where Gianluigi Aponte's MSC has its sights on the successor company to Alitalia.
The 81-year-old, known as ""the captain"" after building his shipping empire from a single vessel, is hoping to forge an air freight and passenger business to dovetail with MSC's sea cargo and cruise operations. 
But there are big challenges. 
Alitalia stumbled for years, with the Italian government spending an estimated 10 billion euros ($11 billion) on rescue efforts before the airline's slimmed-down relaunch as ITA Airways last year. 
That means Rome is bound to monitor any deal very closely.
What looks good on paper may also not be easy in practice. 
""Ocean and air freight are two modes of cargo transports with more differences than similarities,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at the air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta.
""From a purely business perspective, it makes much less sense, even though MSC runs a cruise business, the synergies that they may reap from buying the former Alitalia can't be that big."" 
But what MSC has in its favour are scale and resources. 
    A global supply chain crunch has led to record, multibillion-dollar profits for the world's biggest shipping lines such as privately owned MSC, giving them the firepower to think longer term about how to grow their businesses.
'TRANSFORMATIONAL TRANSACTION'
MSC, also known as Mediterranean Shipping Company, is already the world's No. 1 container shipping line by capacity, having inched ahead of Maersk. It is also the world's No. 3 cruise liner and set to become the second biggest in around 2025 when cruise ships on order arrive.  
In December, MSC made a 5.7 billion euro bid for Vincent Bollore's African logistics business, making an offer for ITA look relatively small by comparison. 
MSC, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, is expected to bid around 1.2-1.6 billion euros for ITA, and is willing to pay in cash, a trade source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It has also teamed up with an experienced airline partner in Germany's Lufthansa. 
Last month, the two companies said they wanted to buy a majority of ITA and asked for an exclusivity period of 90 days to study the deal. 
The trade source said MSC aimed to bring in Lufthansa as a commercial operator with at most a minority stake in ITA, with MSC fronting the deal and able to pay for the purchase in full.
The plan is for MSC to use its unique position with assets in logistics, ports, sea freight as well its passenger cruise and travel businesses to create a platform to scoop up more business and build on both cargo and passenger aviation trade. 
""This is intended to be a transformational transaction (for MSC), it is not about just the passenger business,"" the source said. ""The immediate benefit is expected from the cargo logistics business.""
The kudos of owning a company known as the airline to the Pope is an added bonus. 
For Lufthansa, the deal could increase its market share in Italy for passenger flights and secure more feeder flights to its hubs elsewhere in Europe. Its freight subsidiary Lufthansa Cargo could be part of the expansion too. 
Lufthansa declined to comment. 
HEAD TO HEAD 
So far, the Italian government has responded cautiously.
Before making a decision on exclusive talks, the Treasury wants to see if there are other potential buyers for ITA and what they could offer, a government source told Reuters.
Economy Minister Daniele Franco on Friday officially launched the process to find a partner for ITA, saying the government would initially retain a minority stake.
ITA, which was launched on Oct. 15, has its hub at Rome's Fiumicino airport and owns the majority of take-off and landing rights at Milan's Linate airport. It has 52 planes, less than half that of Alitalia and just four devoted to cargo, and about 2,300 employees versus nearly 11,000 for Alitalia in 2019. 
If the deal comes off, MSC will go head to head with other container rivals such as Denmark's Maersk, which bought air freight company Senator International last year to bolster its air cargo business.
    France's CMA CGM, the world's No. 3 container line, launched its own air cargo business last year.
Unlike the late Onassis, who was one of the world's most famous men, media-shy Aponte operates in a low-key fashion.
In an unexpected move in 2019, MSC hired Soren Toft from Maersk, who formally started as MSC's chief executive in December 2020 to work alongside Aponte senior and son Diego Aponte, who is the group's president. 
""They realised they wanted to continue to expand and grow and needed to bring in outside talent,"" a shipping source said.
""At the same time, everything stops and finishes with the family."" 
The bid for ITA is not the first time Gianluigi Aponte has taken aim at Italy's national airline. 
In 2008, he was part of a private consortium that hoped to buy Alitalia, but he left the project a few months later due in part to the lack of a clear industrial strategy. 
Others connected to shipping have also ventured into airlines. Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who comes from a family of shipowners, founded budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) in 1995.
In contrast, Germany container liner Hapag Lloyd has chosen not to go into air freight. 
""We're certainly not the expert of that and many of our customers will tender their air and sea freight separately,"" Hapag's chief executive Rolf Habben Jansen told a virtual news conference on Feb. 7. 

""I'm not saying their strategy (other container lines) is not valid, we have chosen not to go in that.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday on fears that Russia is set to invade Ukraine, potentially resulting in severe sanctions which could disrupt the global recovery from the pandemic.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 230 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 0.8%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 140 points, or 1%.
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin any day. The U.S. and several other western countries have advised their nationals to leave Ukraine.
The Finance Ministers of the G7 group of large economies followed up on Monday by warning Russia of ""massive"" economic consequences if it chose to invade Ukraine. 
""Any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine will be met with a swift, coordinated and forceful response,"" the G7 Finance Ministers wrote in a joint statement. ""We are prepared to collectively impose economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy.""
This would likely mean sanctions on Russia’s financial system, making it difficult for western companies to pay for the country’s crude exports and forcing them to chase supplies elsewhere, likely pushing energy prices higher.
The main averages on Wall Street closed sharply lower on Friday, with investors already concerned by a red-hot inflation report, deteriorating consumer sentiment and fears of aggressive Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 500 points, or 1.4%, lower on Friday, dropping 1% over the week. The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.9% during the final session of the week and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8%, resulting in weekly losses of 1.8% and more than 2%, respectively.
The week’s main economic focus will be Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed's January meeting, as investors look for any indications on whether the central bank is likely to hike rates by half a percentage point at its upcoming March meeting.
Turning to the corporate sector,  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) will be in focus after the aerospace company scrapped plans to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD), bowing to pressure from antitrust regulators who had sued to prevent the $4.4 billion deal.
Oil prices edged lower, giving back earlier gains having climbed to the highest levels in more than seven years. 
Russia is one of the world’s top crude producers, and any sanctions on its output would disrupt the global supply just as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, struggles to ramp up output to cope with recovering demand. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $92.92 a barrel, falling back after hitting its highest since September 2014, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $94.18, after earlier hitting its highest since October 2014.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,857.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1310.

The revised forecast of 4,900 point is a near 4% cut from the brokerage's previous estimate, but is still 11% above the S&P 500's Friday close of 4,418.64.
The benchmark index has come under pressure since the beginning of the year, shedding nearly 7.3%, as a host of worries ranging from interest rate hikes to tensions in Ukraine has turned investors skittish and markets volatile. 
""Uncertainty abounds regarding the path of inflation and Fed policy,"" Goldman Sachs economists said in a note dated Friday.
U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years. As inflation continues to overshoot the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2% target, the U.S. central bank is expected to take a more hawkish stance by raising interest rates in March.

Goldman economists are expecting seven interest rate hikes in 2022, but at the same time see an upside to U.S. equities as prices rise alongside earnings.
""The majority of earnings growth in the next two years will come from sales growth, with only limited net profit margin expansion,"" Goldman economist David Kostin said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Clariant has delayed the release of its 2021 results as investigators probe whistleblowers' allegations that some staff manipulated accounts in 2020 and 2021 to help meet financial targets, the Swiss speciality chemicals group said on Monday.
Clariant shares fell more than 16% in early trading.
""The investigation is not entirely concluded but suggests that there was a limited group of people globally who may have attempted a profit steering to build some performance buffer,"" Peter Steiner, head of the board's audit committee, told a conference call with reporters.
""So far there is no indication whatsoever that anyone has had any personal gains from this,"" he said, adding there was also no evidence that anyone from former management was involved.
The company has suspended an unspecified number of staff but has not reported the case to prosecutors, he added.
CEO Conrad Keijzer was appointed in December 2020 to run the company after the CEO post was vacant for more than a year.
Former CEO and then-Chairman Hariolf Kottmann, who drove Clariant's 2017 failed merger bid with  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN), had filled the job on an interim basis.
Steiner said the whistleblowers had come forward on Sept. 10 last year, leading to the broadened probe that while far advanced had not allowed group auditor PWC to sign off on results that had been due on Wednesday.
The board decided on Sunday to postpone the release of results and the annual general meeting.
""We are investigating this matter with utmost urgency and diligence,"" Keijzer said. 
Clariant has appointed independent advisers and external counsel Deloitte and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to investigate.
It was not yet clear whether the issue also extends to accounting periods prior to 2020, it added.
Clariant expects to achieve its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin guidance of 16-17% for continuing operations in 2021, as sales rose 15% in local currency to 4.37 billion Swiss francs ($4.72 billion), according to preliminary data, it said.
""Today's announcement is a negative surprise which hopefully does not destroy the reputation the new Clariant management started to install among investors and analysts,"" Baader Helvea Equity Research analysts said.

""The underlying business of Clariant seems to have developed better than expected...However, we doubt the market will (focus) on the preliminary numbers today.""

Investing.com – Crown Resorts stock (ASX:CWNHB) closed 2% higher in Sydney trading Monday after its board endorsed a $6.3-billion offer from Blackstone (NYSE:BX), paving the way for a new owner at the scandal-hit casino operator.
The private equity giant will pay in cash around $9.3 per share (A$13.10), valuing Crown at nearly $8.9 billion. The price is 11% higher than the initial offer from Blackstone almost a year ago, Crown said in a release.
The deal provides billionaire James Packer an exit from the Australian firm 15 years after he established it to diversify the family business away from its media empire.
Packer owns 37% in the firm and Blackstone needs vote of 75% of the shareholders to clinch the deal. That shareholder meeting should happen in the June quarter, Reuters said. Blackstone already owns 10% of the firm.
Authorities had last year found that Crown had knowingly dealt with criminal organizations and concealed that relationship from them. The gambling license for Crown's flagship casino skyscraper in Sydney remains suspended, more than a year after it was due to open. Crown's main earner, its Melbourne casino, must operate with a government-appointed supervisor for two years, Reuters said.
Last October, Crown settled a class-action lawsuit that alleged it failed to inform shareholders of a marketing campaign in China that led to a sharp fall in shares when staff were detained in 2016 for illegally promoting gambling. The company paid over $94 million to settle the case in China without admission of guilt.

(Reuters) -Britain fined sportswear retailers JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports and Footasylum on Monday, saying meetings between their bosses breached an order that barred the two merged companies from integrating further.
JD, Britain's largest sportswear retailer, and Footasylum have been fined a combined 4.7 million pounds ($6.4 million), Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
Shares in JD Sports were down 3.3% at 168.95 pence by 10 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.
The CMA ordered JD last year to sell Footasylum - which it bought in 2019 for 86 million pounds - due to competition concerns. That order had barred the two firms from exchanging commercially sensitive information without prior CMA consent.
JD Sports, which sells brands including  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Puma, said in a statement it had not intended to breach the rules, although ""inadvertently, it was in receipt of limited commercially sensitive information and that this was not reported to the CMA immediately"".
It said it always ""acted honestly and in good faith"" in its efforts to comply with the CMA order and that it would review the CMA's decision and work with the regulator to sell Footasylum.
Footasylum CEO Barry Bown did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment sent by email and LinkedIn.
The watchdog said JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill and Bown held two meetings in July and August - including one in a car - when they discussed Footasylum's financial details, planned store closures and contract negotiations.
""There is a black hole when it comes to the meetings held between Footasylum and JD Sports,"" Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group investigating the merger, said in a statement.
""Both CEOs cannot recall crucial details ... On top of this, neither CEO nor JD Sports' General Counsel can provide any documentation around the meetings.""

The CMA in November ordered JD to sell Footasylum after a second investigation found the combination could leave consumers worse off even considering heightened online competition because of the pandemic.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 05:20AM ET</span>",Some Chinese firms revive New York IPO plans after regulatory crackdown,"By Samuel Shen and Scott Murdoch
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least six Chinese companies have lodged documents for New York listings in recent weeks, filings showed, promising an end to a months-long freeze after an unprecedented clampdown last year by Chinese regulators.
However, the plans are for initial public offerings (IPOs) of small size, ranging from $1 million to $35 million, and are unlikely to trigger a slew of sizeable debuts soon, as companies await more clarity on new offshore listing rules, bankers said. 
Chinese firms raised $12.8 billion in the United States in the first seven months of last year, but the deals halted after the New York debut of Didi Global in late June triggered a regulatory backlash by Beijing.
That brought tighter scrutiny for all offshore listings.
Some smaller Chinese companies are now reviving efforts to sell shares in the United States, confident they are not targeted by the new rules seeking to block offshore listings by firms handling large amounts of data or posing national security risks.
""I think both U.S. and Chinese regulators hope legitimate, law-abiding companies like us can grow bigger and stronger through listings,"" Zhang Jiulin, chairman of insurance broker Hengguang Holding Co, told Reuters.
His company filed a draft IPO prospectus on Jan 18 with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to raise up to $19.6 million via its Nasdaq listing later this year.
Zhang brushed aside concerns that tighter Chinese control of cross-border data transfer will hamper the firm's U.S. listing, saying Hengguang did not collect sensitive individual customer data.
New rules by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) take effect on Tuesday, requiring a security review of all platform companies with data on more than 1 million users before they list overseas.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has also proposed setting up a filing system to tighten scrutiny of offshore listings. 
These new rules came against the backdrop of China's regulatory crackdowns in major sectors such as e-commerce and tutoring which have bashed shares in offshore-listed Chinese companies.
""The filings are too small to be of relevance. I don't see any real easing any time soon,"" said one equity capital markets banker based in Hong Kong, citing uncertainty about the rules, including security review for firms with data on more than 1 million users. 
REGULATORY GESTURE 
Chinese applicants, among which are software maker U-BX Technology and electronic components maker Ostin Technology Group, were enthused by positive signals recently from Chinese and U.S. regulators about such deals, company executives said.
""We have seen some positive gestures from the CSRC,"" Hengguang's Zhang said. 
China and the United States are making progress in coordinating regulations governing Chinese companies listed in New York, CSRC Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai told foreign financial institutions at a meeting last month.
Some others are sanguine too.
""For a small-cap like us, I don't think China's new rules will have a big impact,"" said Ling Tao, chairman of Ostin, which hopes to raise up to $15 million via a Nasdaq listing in March.
Apart from the new IPO applications, more than a dozen Chinese companies have also amended IPO papers this year, SEC filings showed.

""Market participants are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Ming Liao, founding partner of private equity firm Prospect Avenue Capital.
However, China needs robust market-friendly policies to fully revive U.S. listings, he added.

Investing.com –  Glencore  (OTC:GLNCY) stock (LON:GLEN) traded 1.1% lower in London Monday amid prospects of a battle with an activist investor asking for a spin-off of its coal business.
According to the Financial Times, hedge fund Bluebell Capital Partners - which has taken on both French dairy giant Danone and Belgian chemicals company  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) in the past - is pushing it to create a separate coal company with Class A and B shares.
Glencore will retain ‘A’ shares, giving it control of the demerged company and marketing rights to all its coal but only a 9.09% economic interest in its operations. Existing Glencore shareholders will get ‘B’ shares and a 90.91% economic interest, according to the FT.
Bluebell partners Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco called on Glencore last year to demerge a thermal coal business that they claimed is turning off investors, leading the rest of the commodities giant to trade at a discount to its true value. Glencore Chief Executive Gary Nagle has come out against a spinoff, arguing that it would be a more environmentally responsible owner of the assets than many alternative owners.
The push by Bluebell is a riff on what has become a widespread theme as investment managers try to attract new customers with narratives of environmentally friendly and socially aware investment approaches. That has put pressure on companies that derive their profits from fossil fuel extraction and processing. Last year, BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP) put its petroleum assets under a separate unit to please such 'ESG' investors.
While the push against fossil fuels gathers pace, the business itself has had a sharp upswing, thanks to the pandemic-induced shortages and booming economies. That has generated record profits at the companies. Glencore's stock price is up over 55% in the last year as a result.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 05:15AM ET</span>",Explainer-What charges does ex-Goldman banker Ng face in 1MDB corruption trial?,"By Luc Cohen
(Reuters) - Opening statements in former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Roger Ng's U.S. corruption trial https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/rogue-employee-or-goldman-scapegoat-ex-bankers-1mdb-corruption-trial-kick-off-2022-02-10 over the looting of hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund are scheduled to get under way this week.
Ng has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and to launder money. The following is an explanation of the charges Ng faces and how he could defend himself: 
BRIBERY
Ng is charged with one count of conspiring to violate a provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) that makes it illegal to bribe foreign officials. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Ng, together with his former boss Tim Leissner and a Malaysian intermediary named Jho Low https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-1mdb/china-denies-harboring-1mdb-fugitive-jho-low-idUSKCN24U26R, bribed 1MDB officials to win business for Goldman https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-1mdb-settlement-explain/understanding-goldman-sachs-role-in-malaysias-1mdb-mega-scandal-idUSKBN2772HC. 
Prosecutors in a 2021 indictment said Ng attended a 2012 meeting in London in which Low discussed with a 1MDB official the need to bribe officials in Malaysia https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-najib-explainer/explainer-malaysian-ex-pm-najib-and-the-1mdb-scandal-idUSKBN2IM1XM and Abu Dhabi. Low in 2013 sent $6 million in funds traceable to 1MDB to an entity owned by that 1MDB official, prosecutors said. 
Low was indicted alongside Ng by U.S. prosecutors in 2018 but has not appeared to face the charges.
CIRCUMVENTING ACCOUNTING CONTROLS
Ng is also charged with conspiring to violate a provision of the FCPA that makes it illegal to circumvent accounting controls that companies implement to prevent bribery. 
Prosecutors say Ng and Leissner discussed 1MDB business on private, non-Goldman email accounts, and that Ng was present at a meeting in which Leissner falsely told Goldman officials that Low - whom the bank's management had grown to mistrust - was not involved in a deal to help 1MDB raise funds.
MONEY LAUNDERING
Prosecutors have also charged Ng with conspiring to commit money laundering by engaging in monetary transactions in the United States using funds derived from FCPA violations. They say Low, Ng and Leissner conspired to launder funds embezzled from 1MDB through the U.S. financial system and used that money to pay bribes.
Leissner pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering charges in 2018 and is expected to testify against Ng. 
NG'S DEFENSE
Ng's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said Ng was not involved in the scheme perpetrated by Low and Leissner. Agnifilo said Leissner falsely told prosecutors Ng played a role to try to reduce his sentence. 
Agnifilo wrote in a November 2020 court filing that Ng in fact advised his superiors to be cautious in dealing with Low, and that Leissner did not tell Ng that he was secretly working with Low. He has also said financial inflows that Ng received that prosecutors call ill-gotten gains were unrelated to 1MDB.
NG'S POSSIBLE SENTENCE? 
The two FCPA charges each carry maximum prison sentences of five years and the money laundering charge has a maximum sentence of 20 years. Should Ng be convicted, any sentence would be determined by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who is overseeing the case, at a later date. 
WHAT DOES THE TRIAL MEAN FOR GOLDMAN SACHS?

Goldman in 2020 paid a $2.3 billion fine https://www.reuters.com/article/goldmansachs-1mdb-settlement/goldman-to-pay-3-billion-claw-back-executive-pay-over-role-in-1mdb-corruption-scandal-idUSKBN2772E3, returned $600 million in ill-gotten gains and agreed for its Malaysian subsidiary to plead guilty in U.S. court as part of a deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), with the Department of Justice. 
The trial could shed light on how Goldman responded to warnings of possible corruption, but the bank is unlikely to face material damage.

208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 04:54AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says Potential Ukraine War a ‘Polar Vortex’ Risk to Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- A potential Russian invasion of Ukraine could push economies into recession, posing another significant risk for equity markets, according to one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears.
A war “materially increases the odds of a polar vortex for the economy and earnings,” Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. A spike in energy prices “would destroy demand, in our view, and perhaps tip several economies into an outright recession,” the strategist and his team said, adding that energy stocks are most at risk of a selloff.  
Crude oil prices rose, and natural gas surged in European markets on Monday, amid warnings from the U.S. government that Russia could mount an invasion as soon as this week.
The standoff pushed Asian and European stocks lower, exacerbating this year’s rout triggered by fears that central banks will raise interest rates more aggressively than previously anticipated to tame surging inflation. Russian officials have repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine.
Wilson, who has persistently warned that U.S. equity markets are heading for a correction and has the lowest year-end target for the S&P 500 index out of all strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, said Monday that investors will soon shift their focus from inflation to economic growth. In fact, a sharply decelerating economy may mean that the Federal Reserve will not hike rates as many times as markets currently expect, he said. 
“This is why we still favor a more defensive, rather than growth, bias within the quality bucket where we believe earnings achievability is less vulnerable to that growth disappointment,” Wilson said. The stock market’s correction remains incomplete, he said.
To be sure, not everyone shares Wilson’s gloom. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists cut their year-end target for the S&P 500 index, but they still see an upside or around 11% from current levels for U.S. equities. 
“Despite recent volatility, it’s important to remember that we are still in an environment of robust economic and earnings growth, and in our base case we expect upside for equity markets over the balance of the year,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said Monday. “Our base case is that inflation will fall and geopolitical tensions will ease over the coming months, allowing markets to move higher.”

209,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 04:50AM ET</span>","Boeing not concerned about titanium supply, watching other pinch points","By Chen Lin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is not concerned about a potential disruption to Russian titanium supplies because of tensions over Ukraine, but is keeping a close watch on other industry supply chain pinch points, a senior executive said on Monday.
Boeing relies heavily on Russia's VSMPO-AVISMA for the supply of titanium, a lightweight but strong metal that is used widely in planemaking.
Russia has massed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border as it presses demands for a new security arrangement in Europe, prompting U.S. and European officials to threaten a barrage of sanctions if it invades.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes head Stan Deal said the U.S. manufacturer had diversified its titanium supply chain since 2014, when Russia was sanctioned for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, even though titanium was not directly targeted at the time.
""We've got a very diverse titanium supply now,"" he told reporters in a briefing ahead of the Singapore Airshow https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/asias-slow-aviation-recovery-cast-shadow-over-singapore-airshow-2022-02-11, which starts on Tuesday. 
""I will tell you that diversity gives us an opportunity to work through any disruption in the supply chain relative to titanium.""
Securing titanium has been made easier by the fact that fewer jets are being assembled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, allowing plane makers to stockpile reserves.
Boeing has also reduced production of its 787 wide body planes and paused deliveries due to manufacturing flaws and required inspections and repairs. 
Deal reiterated Boeing had no time frame on resuming deliveries and the manufacturer remained in talks with customers on the 787s status.
He said as Boeing and rival Airbus ramped up production of narrow body planes as market conditions improved from pandemic lows, his company was alert to possible pinch points in the supply chain.
""I continue to watch casting, forging, those areas,"" he said. ""We're also watching the human capital side of the equation.""

Deal said there were some early signs of a market recovery in the Asia-Pacific region, where international passenger traffic in 2021 remained 93% below 2019 levels due to border closures but freight revenues helped keep airlines afloat.
""We are already seeing engagement and discussions with customers in this region,"" he said.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  stock (NYSE:LMT) traded 0.9% higher in premarket Monday after it scrapped plans to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD), bowing to pressure from antitrust regulators who had sued to prevent the $4.4 billion deal.
The two companies had agreed to combine in December 2020, but the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies believed the merger would hinder competition. Lockheed said the decision to drop the deal is in the wider interest of its shareholders. Rocketdyne stock fell 2%. 
Handing over Rocketdyne, the only large, independent U.S. manufacturer of engines for rockets and missiles, to Lockheed, could deny other contractors access to critical parts for making competing products, the FTC argued. The two companies had said there would be no disturbance in supplies of components to rivals but the FTC took a dim view of the deal, given the national security concerns.
“We stand by our long heritage as a merchant supplier and trusted partner and will continue to support Aerojet Rocketdyne and other essential suppliers in the defense industrial base still overcoming the challenges of the pandemic,” Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO James Taiclet said in a statement.
This is the second major deal in within a month that the FTC has helped to scupper, the other being Nvidia’s proposal to buy chip designer Arm. The FTC had sued against that deal too, fearing excessive concentration of critical semiconductor technology.  "

Central banks and their interest rate intentions are taking a back seat for markets on Monday, following warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time. 
Asian shares outside Japan are down about 1.5%, Tokyo's Nikkei has slid over 2% and European stock futures are sharply lower.
Oil prices have hit their highest in more than seven years on fears that a possible invasion of Ukraine could trigger U.S. and European sanctions on Russia and disrupt energy exports.
Brent crude was last up over $1 above $95 a barrel.
Hectic diplomacy is under way to prevent war; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz travels to Kyiv on Monday and then to Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin.
The BBC also quoted Ukraine's ambassador to Britain as saying the country could drop its bid to join NATO to avoid war with Russia -- potentially a major concession to Moscow. 
Russia's meanwhile rouble fell 0.5% versus the dollar, failing to benefit from a $95 oil price.
Another fallout from the tensions is that investors have slowed their exit out of safe-haven debt. Yields on German bonds -- viewed among the safest assets globally -- are falling in early European trade. 
Latest Federal Reserve comments also appear to be taking the edge off speculation that the Fed could deliver an aggressive 50 basis point rate hike in March to contain inflation.
Being too ""abrupt and aggressive"" with rate increases could be counter-productive to the Fed's goals, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Sunday, signalling she is not yet prepared to come out of the gate with a half-percentage-point interest rate hike next month.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
- ECB President Christine Lagarde to speak
- European earnings: Poste Italiane, Temenos
-  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) board meets re KKR M&A bid
- Italy's Banco BPM appears to quash takeover talk
- Singapore bank DBS profit rebounds, rate rise prospects improve outlook

The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal in late-January on the grounds that it would allow Lockheed to use its control of Aerojet to hurt other defense contractors. Missile maker Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) was an outspoken opponent of the proposed acquisition. 
The merger, which was announced in late 2020, drew criticism as it would give Lockheed a dominant position over solid fuel rocket motors -- a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry.
Lockheed's Chief Executive James Taiclet said the acquisition would have improved efficiency, speed and cut costs for the U.S. government, but that terminating the agreement was in its stakeholders' best interest.
Aerojet, which reports fourth quarter earnings later this week, said in a separate statement that it still expects a strong ""future performance,"" despite the scrapped merger.
The companies' merger agreement does not include a termination fee in the event that antitrust regulators opposed the deal, according to a regulatory filing. A Lockheed spokesman previously said the company did not plan to make any such payment to Aerojet.
If the deal had ended up in court, it would have been the first litigated defense merger challenge in decades, according to FTC.
Other critics of the deal included U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who https://reut.rs/3GMsoOshad asked the FTC to examine the internal firewalls Lockheed said it would put in place to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over its peers.
Lockheed had said it accounted for 33% of Aerojet's sales and argued that the deal would reduce costs for the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer.

Rocket motors like those made by Aerojet are used in everything from the homeland defensive missile system to Stinger missiles.
Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, NASA, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and the United Launch Alliance.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 02:45AM ET</span>",No sign of light at end of tunnel for Credit Suisse investors,"(This story fixes reference to last week in paragraph six)
By John O'Donnell and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Weary  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) investors fear a long wait for the bank to get back on piste after a string of scandals which have wiped billions off its market value and piled pressure on management.
While Switzerland's second-largest bank says that it can create value by serving its wealthy clients with ""care and entrepreneurial spirit"", the market is not yet convinced and its share price has dropped by nearly a third in a year, knocking some 10 billion Swiss francs ($11 billion) off its valuation. 
    Meanwhile, other big European banks, buoyed by the prospect of rising interest rates, have gained almost 50% in stock market value over the same period and its cross-town Zurich rival UBS has left Credit Suisse for dust.
""Credit Suisse has a long list of scandals and problems,"" Stefan Sauerschell, a bond investor with Union Investment, said of the bank, which was founded in 1856 and says it has 48,770 employees and 3,510 relationship managers around the world.
""We always thought the management process would be improved and then the next punch landed. If there was another billion-plus loss, it would be a catastrophe,"" Sauerschell added.
Things did not get any better last week, however, when Credit Suisse reported a worse-than-expected $2.2 billion quarterly loss and warned of bleak prospects for 2022, when it said earnings would be hit by restructuring costs and pay.
That outlook knocked its already battered shares further, after a year when the bank racked up a 1.6 billion franc loss as a result of the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British finance firm Greensill and a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos.
Proxy adviser Ethos was critical of Credit Suisse's decision not to publish its investigation into the Greensill affair.
""The bank should restore confidence with its shareholders and stakeholders by providing transparency on the roots and causes of the problems,"" Ethos's Vincent Kaufman said in an emailed response to Reuters.
Thomas Gottstein, who became Credit Suisse chief executive in 2020, said after the results this week that he was confident it was well positioned to grow and that risk management was at ""the very core of its DNA"".
Credit Suisse declined further comment.
Yet investors and analysts are not convinced, after hearing of a change in the way the bank pays its top staff, coupled with a tail-off in business and bleak prospects.
""They are in a very difficult situation. We've seen the problems with Greensill and other cases filter down to the business, slowing it down,"" Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said of Credit Suisse's predicament.
""At the same time, the bank has to pay up more cash to keep its staff. Although this might keep staff happy, the market does not like higher costs. And the outlook is subdued."" 
Although Credit Suisse pared back its bonus pool, it softened the blow for its own bankers by taking the unusual step of paying hundreds of millions in cash up front, while reducing the amount of shares it grants to them.
Senior bankers, who the bank said had taken a higher proportion of the bonus cut, received 799 million Swiss francs in cash payouts, up from just 59 million francs in 2020.
SKELETONS
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) this week flagged concerns over a tailing off in money flowing into Credit Suisse, warning that it could drag down revenue and pointing to pressures on wealth management, restructuring costs and higher payouts to staff.
""We expect 2022 results to be weak,"" the credit ratings agency said, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said it was ""hard to find any positives"" in the most recent results, although they do see long-term value in Credit Suisse's shares.
The bank's past continues to haunt it, making it harder to repair an image which is critical to holding on to wealthy customers.
Its reputation is once again being put through the mill in the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, in which Credit Suisse and a former employee face charges of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.
Credit Suisse has rejected all the allegations, while its employee denies wrongdoing.
The trial has attracted huge interest in Switzerland and more Credit Suisse representatives are due to give testimony, with investors keenly watching.
""They need to ... make sure that they don't have any skeletons in the closet anymore,"" one analyst, who asked not to be named, said of what Credit Suisse must now do. 

""They have moved themselves into a position where you don't give them the benefit of the doubt.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Crown Resorts Ltd backed a $6.3 billion buyout from private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc on Monday, giving billionaire James Packer an exit route from the Australian casino firm beset by scandals and regulatory setbacks.
Packer will cash in his chips a decade and a half after he created Crown to shift away from the Packer family's media empire in a bid to reinvent the dynasty as a gambling business. 
The A$13.10 cash offer values Crown below its share price in 2019, before COVID-19 restrictions and damaging regulatory inquiries in the three states it operates, but Chief Executive Steve McCann said it provides much-needed certainty for shareholders.
Crown shares rose 2% to A$12.65 on Monday.
""When you're looking at a change of control, it's not today's trading price and today's earnings,"" McCann told analysts on a call, responding to a question about whether the company's decision factored in post-pandemic trading and intense regulatory scrutiny.
""It's a much broader assessment. This is a pretty fair price.""
Blackstone, which already holds around 10% of Crown, will take over a company facing regulator scrutiny after official investigations found it had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled the authorities about it.
The gambling licence for Crown's flagship A$2.2 billion casino skyscraper in Sydney remains suspended, more than a year after it was due to open. Crown's main earner, its Melbourne casino, must operate with a government-appointed supervisor for two years.
""Moving towards a new ownership structure is an important initial step forward in resolving the many regulatory concerns that have been highlighted,"" said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, which has Crown shares.
John Ayoub, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which also holds Crown shares, supported the decision to back the deal - Blackstone's fourth attempt.
""In light of what's transpired over the past few years this is a good outcome for all parties involved,"" Ayoub said.
As Crown's biggest shareholder with 37% of the company, Packer's vote will be pivotal to reach the 75% shareholder approval threshold. A spokesperson for Packer, who would walk away with about A$3.3 billion, declined to comment. 
Chris Tynan, senior managing director and head of real estate at Blackstone Australia, said in a statement the company was ""very pleased to have entered into a binding implementation agreement with Crown.""
END OF AN ERA
Packer has been pulling back from corporate life for years and a decision to support the deal would effectively end one of Australia's most storied business dynasties.
Packer's journalist grandfather Frank Packer in 1936 started Australian Consolidated Press, a newspaper and magazine juggernaut that would dominate the country's media landscape for more than half a century.
The outsize influence of the media empire was reinforced under the control of Kerry Packer, Frank's son and James' father, until Kerry's death in 2005. 
James, however, took the family business in a new direction, splitting the parent company Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd into Consolidated Media Holdings to retain the traditional assets and Crown Ltd, which spearheaded his gambling industry ambitions. He promptly sold the media assets.
But Crown was in serious difficulty within a decade. As it pushed ahead with rapid expansion plans in Macau, Las Vegas and Australia, 19 of the company's staff were jailed in China for breaking that country's laws banning the marketing of gambling.
That prompted an abrupt retreat from all dealings abroad, while Packer himself began to step away from corporate life, quitting the boards of Crown and his private investment vehicle, CPH Holdings.

The Blackstone deal still needs regulatory approval. A shareholder meeting to vote on it is expected in the June quarter.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, continuing last week’s selloff, as the threat of war in Ukraine added to concerns surrounding high inflation and the prospect of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
By 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 3.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1.9%.
Escalating tensions on the Ukraine border as Russian troops swell in number are causing investors to fret, especially after U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on CNN on Sunday that there’s “a distinct possibility that there will be major military action very soon.” The U.S. and several other western countries have advised their nationals to leave Ukraine.
Western leaders have threatened severe sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion, even as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz continues the diplomatic onslaught by visiting Ukraine later in the day, followed by a trip to Moscow the day after.
Such sanctions would likely have a severe impact on the likes of EVRAZ plc (LON:EVRE), as the Russian steel group's London listing is an obvious potential target for any financial sanctions that the West may impose in retaliation for a Russian invasion.  Evraz  stock fell over 30%. That said, all the major sub-sectors were in the red.
Elsewhere,  Clariant  (SIX:CLN) stock fell over 14% after the Swiss chemicals group delayed the release of its 2021 results due to an investigation into accounting issues, while commodities giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) fell 1.8% amid news of fresh pressure on it from outside investors to spin off its coal business.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock fell 6.5% after Germany's Finance Minister said the government would not keep its stake in the lender in the long run. Despite its rally so far this year, the stock is still well short of what Angela Merkel's government paid for it over a decade ago.
Global markets sold off last week on fears that surging U.S. inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively, starting with a 50 basis point hike in March. These concerns were compounded by a slump in the Michigan Consumer Sentiment index.
Oil prices fell back from the highest levels in more than seven years. Many fear that an invasion of Ukraine would lead to sanctions on Russia’s financial system, making it impossible for western companies to pay for Russian crude exports and forcing them to chase supplies elsewhere on the global market. 
Russia is one of the world’s top crude producers, and such a disruption to global supply would occur just as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, struggles to ramp up output to cope with recovering demand. 
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $93.03 a barrel, falling back after hitting its highest since September 2014, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $94.21, after earlier hitting its highest since October 2014.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,858.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1309.

""In the long run, the state will not be a shareholder in Commerzbank,"" Christian Lindner was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt newspaper.
Lindner said he would take into consideration taxpayers' financial interest and the importance of Commerzbank for Germany's medium-sized economy when this decision is made in the future.

The government holds a stake of more than 15% in Commerzbank following a bailout during the financial crisis.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:50AM ET</span>","Singapore bank DBS profit rebounds, rates outlook improves outlook","By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) flagged strong business momentum after its profit rose to a record last year, cementing a recovery for Southeast Asia's largest lender as pandemic-hit economies rebound and boost loan growth and asset quality.
Singapore lenders are also expected to be big beneficiaries of rising interest rates, while the city-state's economy is forecast to grow 3% to 5% this year after expanding at its fastest annual pace in over a decade in 2021.
Krishna Guha, an analyst at Jefferies said on Monday that while the bank's fourth-quarter profit was slightly below estimates due to lower than expected non-interest income, growth in other revenue metrics was ""outstanding.""
""Guidance for 2022 is in line with our current inputs but for the credit costs, and is likely to be the next driver of positive earnings revisions,"" Guha said in a note.
DBS, the first Singapore bank to report this season, said net profit for October-December rose to S$1.39 billion ($1.03 billion) and follows a particularly weak pandemic-hit year when profit tumbled to a three-year low in the fourth quarter.
The result, however, missed an average estimate of S$1.47 billion from four analysts polled by Refinitiv, and was also 18% lower than the third quarter, hit by a 41% drop in non-interest income. DBS shares traded flat on Monday.
""As I look forward, the pipelines are looking good,"" Chief Executive Piyush Gupta told a news conference on Monday, adding that DBS was seeing all-round robust growth across its wealth management, transaction banking and investment banking businesses.
He said risks included the uncertainty on the level and timing of U.S. rate increases, and China's moves to combat the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the impact on the world's second-largest economy.
Under Gupta, DBS has pumped in billions of dollars to upgrade its technology infrastructure over the past decade as it embraced cloud computing and digitised services.
Since Gupta took charge in 2009, DBS has broken into the ranks of the top wealth managers in Asia, acquired a bank in India and one in China over the past year, and forayed into businesses such as a digital exchange and a global carbon exchange to tap new revenue streams.
DBS, which earns most of its profit from Singapore and Hong Kong, struck a deal last month to pay S$956 million to buy  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s consumer business in Taiwan, as it shores up regional acquisitions to power growth.
DBS expects mid-to-single digit loan growth or better this year, after reporting a 9% increase last year.
The bank's full-year profit rose 44% to a record S$6.8 billion as 9% growth in loans, the highest in seven years, and a surge in wealth management and transaction banking services fees offset the impact of lower interest rates.
U.S. interest rate futures are more or less fully priced for a half-point increase in March and up to 1.75 percentage points of tightening by year end, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
For the latest quarter, DBS said allowances for loan losses decreased to S$33 million in the latest quarter from S$577 million a year earlier.

Buoyed by the improved outlook for banks, investors have pushed up Singapore bank stocks this year, with DBS and smaller rival UOB trading near record highs.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:16AM ET</span>",Factbox-The assets ITA Airways can offer suitors,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shipping group MSC and airline Lufthansa are interested in buying a majority stake in Alitalia's successor, ITA Airways, despite the airline's history of failed privatisations and 170 million euro ($194 million) operating loss in 2021. 
The Italian government has spent an estimated 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) of taxpayers' money on Alitalia over the years. Here is what may be attractive to ITA's suitors:
STREAMLINED ORGANISATION, REDUCED COSTS
ITA has a fleet of 52 aircraft, less than half that of Alitalia, and employs around 2,300 people compared with nearly 11,000 at Alitalia in 2019. Some 7,000 former Alitalia employees have been put on a layoff scheme funded by the government.
ITA has signed a labour contract that is less generous than that of Alitalia. The new carrier only owns an aviation business, without handling and maintenance operations.
ITA operates fewer routes than Alitalia did after cancelling several domestic point-to-point flights and reducing long-haul routes to just Rome-New York. It plans to expand its long-haul operations, starting from the summer.
MILAN CITY AIRPORT
ITA owns the majority of take-off and landing rights at Milan's Linate airport, which is considered a key base for routes to European destinations. Linate traditionally attracts an important share of business passengers as Milan is Italy's financial capital and the airport is only 6.5-km from the city centre.
ROME FIUMICINO AIRPORT
ITA's hub is an important entry point for both Italian domestic routes and international destinations. Rome is at the centre of the Mediterranean, making Fiumicino attractive for developing routes towards Africa. Rome is also a key tourist destination in Italy, with high-speed train connections with several Italian cities.
ALITALIA BRAND
ITA bought the old Alitalia brand for 90 million euros last year to avoid it being acquired by one of Alitalia's competitors. The brand is considered a symbol of Italian style and is well-known globally, as Alitalia was the airline of the pope and the country's top lawmakers. Prime Minister Mario Draghi last year joked Alitalia was ""a family thing, even if a bit expensive"".
CASH 

ITA currently has more than 400 million euros in its coffers, partly as a result of a 700 million euro capital injection by the Italian government last year when the carrier started flying in place of Alitalia.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 01:00AM ET</span>","In relief for retailers, Vietnam won't close factories amid COVID surge","By Khanh Vu and Phuong Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese factories making everything from shoes to smartphones are expected to continue production despite record COVID-19 infections, reversing a policy of sweeping lockdowns last year that hobbled global supply chains for Western retailers.
One of the world's biggest garment makers, Vietnam reported more than 26,000 new infections on Sunday, or about double the peak last year, when factories supplying brands such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Zara, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930) were shut for months.
But unlike nine months ago, when the Delta variant was spreading through a mostly unvaccinated population, now millions of factory workers have been fully vaccinated and the Omicron variant is proving less severe, the government said. 
""The risk of widespread lockdowns is very low this year as Vietnam has successfully carried out its COVID-19 vaccination campaign,"" Dang Duc Anh, director of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, told Reuters.
Vietnam has been relaxing curbs in recent months, with schools re-opening last week and the government saying on Sunday it would lift restrictions on arriving international passenger flights.
More than 76% of the population has received at least two vaccine doses, up from 3.3% early in September last year, the health ministry says.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, which represents U.S. businesses and last year urged the government to ease its curbs, is anticipating a better 2022, said Adam Sitkoff, its executive director.
""I do not expect to see additional countrywide lockdowns as serious cases in most parts of the country are at a manageable level and the authorities have learned that economy-crippling restrictions are not sustainable,"" Sitkoff told Reuters.
The government is targeting economic growth of 6% to 6.5% this year, up from 2.5% in 2021.
Smooth factory operations in Vietnam, the second biggest exporter of clothes and footwear to the United States after China, will also help free up supply chain bottlenecks that are pushing up inflation around the world.
""If Vietnam can maintain a strong production capability and factory output, this will really support the global supply chain, in particular for sectors like agriculture, textiles and electronics consumers,"" said Duc Minh Nguyen, a partner at accounting firm EY.
SHIFTING SUPPLY CHAINS
Over the last decade Vietnam has emerged as one of the most attractive alternative production hubs for companies looking to reduce their exposure to China. 
That trend is expected to continue, if Vietnam can emerge relatively unscathed from the current Omicron wave and Beijing keeps up its tough lockdowns to suppress infection.
""Vietnam will be a key beneficiary of shifting supply chains, particularly in regards to low value-add manufacturing relocating out of China and electronics,"" said Raphael Mok, head of Asia country risk for Fitch Solutions.
Vietnam won praise early in the pandemic for curbing infections with its tight controls, but a flare-up last summer caused by the Delta variant kept millions of workers at home amid lockdowns in Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring industrial provinces.
In September, at the height of the lockdowns, businesses began considering moving production elsewhere.
Lululemon, a Canadian clothing retailer, shifted production out of Vietnam in September. Nike, which sources half its footwear from the southeast Asian nation, cut its 2022 sales forecast due to factory closures there.
Now, 90% to 95% of garment and textile workers have returned to work after the Lunar New Year holiday, said Truong Van Cam, deputy chairman and general secretary of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association.
Vietnam's factory workers, who earn on average $330 per month, are hoping to make up for earnings lost last year.
""Things are pretty smooth now ... there are many orders that need delivering so we can work overtime to earn more,"" said Nguyen Van Hoang, 28, who works at a leather factory in Ho Chi Minh City.
""I don't think factory lockdowns will become a thing in the future."" 

Ninh Thi Ty, chairwoman of Ho Guom Group, which makes garments for firms such as CK, Mango, Zara and H&M, said she expected the government would soon designate COVID-19 an endemic illness.
""More lockdowns would hurt businesses like ours, as we wouldn’t be able to deliver products to customers,"" said Ty, whose garment factories employ 6,000 workers in Vietnam.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The former head of India's largest stock exchange shared confidential information with a yogi and sought his advice on crucial decisions, a probe by the market regulator has found, ahead of the bourse's much-awaited public listing.
In a case of ""bizarre misconduct"" that was a ""glaring breach"" of regulations, Chitra Ramkrishna, the former chief executive of National Stock Exchange (NSE), shared information including the bourse's financial projections, business plans and board agenda with a purported spiritual guru in the Himalayas, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said. 
""The sharing of financial and business plans of NSE ... is a glaring, if not unimaginable, act that could shake the very foundations of the stock exchange,"" SEBI said in an order, imposing penalties on Ramkrishna, the bourse and other top former executives for the lapses. 
Ramkrishna, who quit NSE in 2016 citing ""personal reasons"", was not immediately reachable for comment. NSE and SEBI did not respond to requests for comment.
Allegations of corporate governance lapses have dogged NSE for several years. The exchange had planned to go public in 2017 but its listing was derailed by allegations officials had provided some high frequency traders unfair access through co-location servers, which could speed up algorithmic trading.
After a three-year investigation, SEBI fined the exchange over $90 million and barred it from raising money on securities markets for six months. NSE challenged the order in court and has sought SEBI's approval to file for a new IPO.
However, during that investigation, SEBI found documents showing Ramkrishna's emails to an unknown person, who she said during questioning was a ""spiritual force"" she had sought guidance from for 20 years. 
Ramkrishna, in her defence, told SEBI that sharing of information with the person who was ""spiritual in nature"" did not compromise confidentiality or integrity. 
The SEBI order however stated that it was ""absurd"" for Ramkrishna to contend that sharing sensitive information such as dividend pay-out ratios, business plans and the performance appraisals of NSE employees did not cause harm. 
The SEBI probe also found the purported guru had substantial influence over the appointment of a mid-level executive, without any capital market experience, directly as an adviser to Ramkrishna with inadequate documentation and a salary higher than most senior NSE officials.
The guru was running the exchange, and Ramkrishna was ""merely a puppet in his hands"", SEBI said.
Questions emailed to an address given in the SEBI order as belonging to the guru were not immediately responded to. 
SEBI also said NSE and its board were aware of the exchange of confidential information but had chosen to ""keep the matter under wraps"".
The regulator fined NSE 20 million rupees ($270,000) and has barred the exchange from launching any new products for six months. 

SEBI imposed a penalty of 30 million rupees on Ramkrishna and barred her from any bourse and SEBI-registered intermediary for three years. 
Ramkrishna was among a group of executives who in the early 1990s started NSE as a challenger to the more established BSE Ltd, then known as Bombay Stock Exchange. She was appointed joint managing director of NSE in 2009 and promoted to CEO in 2013.

In a statement, the company said the agreement, with the Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation (YAC), will ensure a new co-designed management plan protects social and cultural heritage values in Rio's proposed development of the Western Range iron ore project in the Pilbara region.
Rio said the collaboration would ensure the mines were designed to reduce impacts on social and cultural heritage. Decisions on environmental matters and mine planning will be made jointly with the Yinhawangka people, it said.

The announcement follows a massive public and investor uproar following Rio's destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters in Western Australia for an iron ore mine. That uproar led to the departure of top executives including former Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques and the Chairman Simon Thompson.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.06%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.54% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.40%.
Concerns are mounting that Russia’s military buildup near its border with Ukraine enters a potentially decisive phase. The U.S. warned that a Russian invasion could be imminent, while Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted that the U.S. has failed to meet his demands.
Russia continues to deny any plans of invasion, and countries are continuing a diplomatic push to resolve the situation. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to Ukraine later in the day and to Russia on Tuesday for diplomatic talks.
These tensions are adding volatility to a market already rocked by high inflation and the prospect of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. A deterioration in Eastern Europe could heighten price pressure concerns if Russian energy supplies are disrupted.
This is likely “to result in a far more volatile ride than 2021, and we are already seeing this,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Investments senior economist Diana Mousina said in a note.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - State-run Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has filed draft papers with the market regulator to sell 5% of its shares to potentially raise nearly $8 billion, dwarfing the biggest IPO in Asia's third-largest economy by a considerable margin. 
The offering is crucial to the Narendra Modi-led government's efforts to meet its sharply trimmed divestment target for the current financial year and will provide a measure of the success of the government's pro-market policies.
India's largest insurer will be selling 316.25 million shares, according to the draft prospectus filed on Sunday, amounting to nearly 5% of the post-offer paid up share capital. 
The government could raise a little more than 600 billion Indian rupees ($7.97 billion) from the issuance rather than the initial plan for about 900 billion rupees, having trimmed the offering because of market conditions, a government source said.
The listing is likely to be completed by the end of March, the source added.
The filing also stated an embedded value of 5.39 trillion Indian rupees ($71.56 billion). The embedded value is a measure of future cash flows in life insurance companies and a key financial gauge for insurers.
The IPO is seen as a test of investor appetite for new offerings, with a number of companies that listed last year now trading below their offer prices on concerns over lofty valuations and looming increases to interest rates by global central banks fighting inflationary pressures. 
The expected listing also comes against the backdrop of foreign investors pulling out funds from the domestic market.
The life insurance giant, which had more than 105,000 full-time employees at the end of September and counts itself among the top five global insurers, manages more than $500 billion of assets and holds more than 60% of India's life insurance market by premiums. 
Graphic: Top five global insurers: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-IPO/LIC/gkvlgjzqjpb/chart.png 
LIC has more than 280 million policies in force and a report by Brand Finance has put the insurer's brand value at $8.66 billion.
Though the government's scaling back of its privatisation target to $10.5 billion raised uncertainty about the size of the planned LIC offering, government officials have said investors should not assume the revised target points to a smaller than expected IPO for LIC.
India's most recent IPO by a life insurer was in 2017, when HDFC Life Insurance raised $1.3 billion. Its share price has nearly doubled since the listing. 
Graphic: India's 10 biggest IPOs: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-IPO/IPO/zdpxoqmnyvx/chart.png 
LIC's planned offering will dwarf the record $2.5 billion IPO by payments company Paytm last year. Though Paytm's IPO was then the country's biggest, the shares have since fallen by 58% from its offer price.
Indian companies raised a record $16.6 billion through initial share sales in 2021, 52% more than the previous record high in 2017, Refinitiv data shows.
The LIC listing could make it one of India's five biggest companies by market capitalisation, joining energy to telecoms group Reliance Industries, software services company TCS, HDFC Bank and IT giant Infosys (NYSE:INFY).
PAST IPOs
State-run companies that completed the previous three biggest such IPOs have lost more than half their market value since listing. 
Coal India is trading at about 145 rupees a share, a far cry from its listing price of about 350 rupees in 2010.
Similarly, state-run insurers General Insurance Corp and New India Assurance are trading at a little more than 135 rupees per share, less than half their IPO prices.
Government officials told Reuters that India will be ""very sensitive"" while pricing the LIC share issue to ensure decent long-term returns on investment. The price band will be decided in the coming days and roadshows for potential investors will begin shortly.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS), Nomura and SBI Capital Market along with five other banks are the IPO bookrunners, according to the draft papers.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2022 07:10PM ET</span>",Dyson faces claims from former workers at Malaysian supplier,"By A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Ten former workers from Dyson's biggest parts supplier, Malaysian firm ATA IMS, are claiming compensation from the home appliance maker over poor working and living conditions at ATA factories, a law firm representing them said on Friday. 
The ex-employees allege that ""Dyson was unjustly enriched as a result of the unlawful, exploitative and dangerous conditions at the factory"", British law firm Leigh Day said in a statement.
A Dyson spokesperson told Reuters: ""These allegations relate to employees of ATA, not Dyson. If proceedings were to be issued we would robustly defend them.""
The company said it takes its responsibilities towards workers employed by its third-party suppliers ""extremely seriously"".
ATA, which makes parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, did not have an immediate comment on the claim.
Dyson said in November it was severing relations with ATA, and ending its contract within six months, after an independent audit of the company's labour practices and accusations by a whistleblower. Dyson has not disclosed the findings of its audit.
Leigh Day has sent a ""letter before action"" to Singapore-headquartered Dyson on behalf of the workers and named four company units as the defendants in the claim, it said. The letter is a notice that legal proceedings could be initiated. 
""In the letter before action, sent by law firm Leigh Day on behalf of the workers, Dyson is asked to pay compensation to the workers. If a settlement cannot be reached the case will progress to the High Court,"" Leigh Day said in the statement. 
The letter was sent to Dyson on Dec. 10, Oliver Holland, a partner at Leigh Day, told Reuters.
Holland said Leigh Day may initiate judicial proceedings in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in March if Dyson does not engage in settlement talks. 
He said Leigh Day is representing the workers on a ""no win, no fee"" basis. 
Reuters reported on Nov. 25 and Dec. 5 that ATA's mostly migrant workforce did overtime hours exceeding Malaysia's legal limit of 104 per month, and worked on Sundays. Citing 11 employees, Reuters also reported on Dec 5 that ATA had coached staff ahead of labour inspections to hide true working and living conditions, and employed foreigners without permits.
ATA acknowledged publicly on Dec. 7 some violations, made some improvements, and said it now complies with all regulations and standards. 
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Dyson said it conducts frequent audits to monitor its supply chain and make improvements, and that it terminated its contract with ATA after the supplier failed to take swift action on a recent audit.
ATA was audited six times between 2019 and 2021, it said.

""During this period we demanded, and achieved, numerous improvements for ATA employees, including ensuring that more than 1,250 ATA workers had recruitment fees reimbursed to them on a point of principle,"" it said. 
""We received the results of the final inspection in October 2021, at which time it became clear to us that ATA management was not acting swiftly or vigorously enough to respond to Dyson's demands for further improvements.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has transferred 4% of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares worth $80 billion to the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, the government said on Sunday.
The shares will bolster the Public Investment Fund's (PIF) strong financial position and high credit ratings in the medium term, the crown prince said in a statement. The fund is the prince's vehicle of choice to transform the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil revenues. 
The state remains the largest shareholder in Saudi Aramco after the transfer process, as it retains more than 94% of the company's shares, the statement said. 
The transfer of existing shares would help to boost PIF's assets under management, which are targeted to grow to about 4 trillion riyals ($1.07 trillion) by the end of 2025, it added.
""It supports the outlook for the PIF raising funds internationally, including bonds, and could potentially support a future Aramco share sale going forward,"" Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said. 
Saudi Aramco said in a statement the transfer was a private transaction between the government and the state fund. ""The company is not a party to the transfer and did not enter into any agreements or pay or receive any proceeds from that transfer,"" it said.
It said the move would not affect the number of issued shares nor the company's operations, strategy, dividends distribution policy or governance framework. 
It added that the shares transferred would rank equally among other existing ordinary shares. 
Saudi officials had previously raised the possibility of Aramco share sales. The PIF did not comment.
The head of the sovereign wealth fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said last year that Saudi Aramco may consider selling more shares if market conditions are right, while the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the kingdom could target a stake sale of as much as $50 billion.
""The PIF is Saudi Arabia’s main vehicle to execute its 2030 vision, which suggests that this share transfer could imply further share sales down the line as a way to raise funds for the PIF to be reinvested elsewhere,"" Yousef Husseini, associate director at EFG Hermes, said. 
Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, completed the world's largest initial public offering in late 2019, raising $29.4 billion, with the proceeds transferred to the PIF. 
Aramco's shares are up just over 4% so far this year, valuing the company at $1.99 trillion, behind the world's most valuable company, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). The shares declined 0.7% to 37.05 riyals at the close on Sunday.

After a sharp fall in energy prices in the early days of the pandemic, demand for oil is nearing pre-Covid levels with Brent crude trading around $94 a barrel amid concerns over tight global supplies.

The company announced its intention to delist its U.S. shares on Tuesday. Shares of the Amsterdam-based company remain listed on the Amsterdam and London stock exchanges.
""This is a cost reduction measure,"" Groen told Dutch television programme ""Business Class"" in an interview. He repeated that the company is still considering various strategic options for the subsidiary's future.

In the interview, Groen repeated his conviction that only the largest food delivery players in each market will, eventually, be highly profitable. He acknowledged the company is ""not number 1"" in the U.S. where it competes with Doordash and Uber (NYSE:UBER) among others.
""We have to get into a market position such as we have in the Netherlands, so that we can earn money,"" he said.

""We have a lot of discussions with people in the U.S. over Grubhub. (But) if you talk to people then you have to have the goal that it improves the business.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's federal investigation agency has filed a police complaint against ABG Shipyard Ltd and its promoters accusing it of defrauding banks of 228.42 billion Indian rupees ($3.03 billion).
The report, posted on the Central Bureau of Investigation's website, said a forensic audit report it received from the banks two years ago had found instances of fraud in April 2012 and July 2017.
ABG Shipyard could not be reached for comment and did not immediately respond to an email. The shipbuilder, identified by the central bank as one of India's ""dirty dozen"" highly indebted companies, has filed for bankruptcy resolution.
According to figures from the forensic audit that were included in the CBI complaint, the company owed 70.89 billion rupees to ICICI Bank, 36.34 billion rupees to IDBI Bank, 29.25 billion rupees to the State Bank of India, 16.14 billion rupees to Bank of Baroda, 12.44 bilion rupees to Punjab National Bank and 12.28 billion rupees to Indian Overseas Bank.
State Bank of India, where the accounts of ABG Shipyard were maintained, had filed the forensic audit in a report to the CBI.
That report, included in the CBI complaint posted on Sunday, said the fraud took the form of diversion of funds, ""misappropriation and criminal breach of trust with an objective to gain unlawfully at the cost of the Bank's funds"".

""The money was used for purposes other than the purpose for which the funds were released by the Bank"", it said.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Toronto-Dominion Bank has frozen two personal bank accounts into which C$1.4 million ($1.1 million) had been deposited to support protesters fighting the Canadian government's pandemic measures, a bank spokesperson said on Saturday.
The demonstrations, dubbed the ""Freedom Convoy"" by Canadian truckers opposing a vaccination mandate https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-canada-trucking-idCNL1N2UK2CD for cross-border drivers as well as other pandemic restrictions, are now in their third week. They have gridlocked the capital Ottawa and blocked U.S.-Canada border crossings, damaging trade between the two countries. 
Early on Saturday, Canadian police began clearing protesters https://www.reuters.com/article/healthcoronavirus-canada-trucking/update-1-canada-police-start-to-clear-protesters-blocking-u-s-canada-bridge-idINL1N2UN09T blocking a key bridge linking Canada and the United States. 
TD applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Friday to take the funds, which were sent through GoFundMe and bank transfers, so they can either be sent to the intended recipients or returned to the donors ""who have requested refunds but whose entitlement to a refund cannot be determined by TD,"" the bank said in a statement. 
TD has been put ""on notice that their actions are improper and disappointing,"" Keith Wilson, a lawyer for the convoy, said in an email on Saturday, adding the convoy will seek a court order next week to release the donations to a new not-for-profit corporation that has been set up to manage and distribute them.
One of the bank accounts received a lump sum of C$1 million through GoFundMe, while the rest was sent to the second account through multiple bank e-transfers, the TD spokesperson said. TD does not know where the GoFundMe payment originated, they said.
GoFundMe took down the protest convoy's donation page on Feb. 4 after it reached $10 million, prompting most of the protesters to turn to Boston-based GiveSendGo. GoFundMe has said https://twitter.com/gofundme it will refund the donations.
The Ontario Superior Court on Thursday ordered GiveSendGo to freeze all funds sent in aid of the protest. The crowdfunding platform defied that order in a tweet https://twitter.com/GiveSendGo/status/1491940399505682434 on Thursday.
The protest has raised C$11 million on GiveSendGo, Wilson said.
""We are also going to be taking the Ontario government to court to seek an immediate lifting of what we consider to be an unlawful order,"" he said. 
Canada's other major banks did not immediately respond to emails asking if they were taking steps similar to TD.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Geopolitical worries have added another layer of volatility to an already-jumpy market as investors priced in the possibility of escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, though some doubted the issue would weigh on U.S. asset prices over the longer term. 
Reports of rising tensions between the two countries slammed stocks on Friday and lifted prices for Treasuries, the dollar and other safe-haven assets. Investors were already rattled by a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve. 
""The market is reacting because an actual invasion has not yet been priced in,"" said Michael Farr of Farr, Miller and Washington LLC. ""The severity of an invasion, if one occurs, will correlate to the severity of the market’s reaction."" 
Russia has massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion, Washington said on Friday. It urged all U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine within 48 hours. 
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said it remained unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had definitively given the order to invade. Sullivan said he expected U.S. President Joe Biden to press for a phone call soon with his counterpart. 
Despite market gyrations, some investors were skeptical whether a more serious conflict would drag broader markets over the longer term. 
""The reaction the market is likely to have is selling until it becomes more evident what an invasion looks like and then what kind of response U.S. and European allies have to it,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""We're not suggesting making any changes predicated on the news cycle around the topic.""
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down nearly 1.9% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was off around 2.8%. [.N/C] The moves followed weakness on Thursday sparked by expectations that the Fed will aggressively fight surging inflation. The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, was up for a second straight session, hitting its highest since the end of January. 
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), said the impact of major geopolitical events on U.S. stocks has been limited.
“For instance, after JFK was assassinated in November 1963 stocks went on one of their best six-month runs ever,"" he said. ""The truth is a solid economy can make up for a lot of sins.” 
Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management, said the S&P 500 would probably find support at around 4,200, more than 200 points below Friday's closing level. 
An intensifying conflict could add “more credence to our view that the Fed will be more dovish than the market currently believes as the war would make the outlook even more uncertain,"" he said. 
But the Fed could stay aggressive if oil prices keep surging. Crude has already soared to seven-year highs on Ukraine jitters. 
“By pushing energy prices even higher, a Russian invasion would likely exacerbate inflation and redouble pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates,” said Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank, in a Friday note. 
“From the Fed’s perspective, the inflationary effects of a Russian invasion and higher energy prices would likely outweigh the shock’s negative implications for global growth,” he said.
On Friday Brent crude futures settled up $3.03, or 3.3%, at $94.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose $3.22, or 3.6%, to $93.10 a barrel.

Worries over the conflict will ""create volatility until people verify it's true and what is the duration before international leadership steps in and to what extent does the rest of the world step in,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. 
“We just have to see how this plays out over the weekend and whether or not international leadership can bring this under wraps,"" he said.

With its roots in the wealthy Lombardy region Banco BPM, which has a market capitalisation of around 5.4 billion euros ($6.13 billion), is seen as the ideal geographical fit for UniCredit, Italy's second-biggest bank.
""We still have a very important path to take on the stock exchange, we have a very important standalone growth path ahead of us that is not yet fully exploited,"" Banco BPM Chief Executive Giuseppe Castagna said on the sidelines of the ASSIOM FOREX conference in Parma. ""Banco BPM is worth more."" 
Asked about potential interest from UniCredit, Castagna said the bank had not received any communication from its larger peer in that regard. 
Responding to the rumours of a potential imminent bid, UniCredit on Friday said it continued to evaluate all strategic options and would inform the market in due time, adding no extraordinary board meeting had been called. 
Earlier this week, Banco BPM shares hit their highest-level in four years after the lender posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, as loan loss provisions more than halved and fees boosted revenues. 
Castagna said at the time the lender did not see any merger opportunities at present and was concentrating on the business plan it had presented last year. 
""We have just come out of a restructuring process, we have presented an aggressive plan ... but we think the market is only beginning to recognise what is the path that will take us much further,"" Castagna added on Saturday.

The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, is now making masks optional on the trading floor and other public areas for fully vaccinated personnel and visitors, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, adding that the existing COVID-19 polices would still remain in place.
The exchange joins investment banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which also said on Friday that they were dropping the requirement for staff to wear masks in the office.
Goldman Sachs will no longer require masks to be worn by employees at its U.S. offices from Monday and will leave it to individuals to decide if they want to mask up, a spokeswoman at the bank said.
For fully vaccinated employees of JPMorgan working out of their U.S. offices, masks have been made completely voluntary, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
A large percentage of JPMorgan's staff has been vaccinated, the memo sent to all U.S. employees said, adding that contact tracing and mandatory bi-weekly testing will be carried out for unvaccinated staff entering the offices.

Staff at Morgan Stanley's offices will not be required to wear masks, a spokeswoman for the bank said, as only vaccinated employees are allowed into their buildings.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd plans to produce blue hydrogen at a ""competitive cost"" of about $1.2-$1.5 per kg as it repurposes its $4-billion gasification assets, the conglomerate said in a presentation.
Owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Reliance has in the past year unveiled plans to reduce its dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemicals business and invested in clean energy projects to burnish its green credentials.
Reliance will initially use syngas, produced by petcoke gasifies, to make blue hydrogen for it Jamnagar complex in western Gujarat state, until green hydrogen's cost comes down, it said in the presentation released late on Friday.
Hydrogen produced from natural gas and which eliminates emissions by capturing and storing the emitted carbon is called blue hydrogen. Green Hydrogen is extracted from water using electrolysis powered by renewable energy.
""In the interim, till cost of green hydrogen comes down, RIL can be the first mover to establish a hydrogen ecosystem, with minimal incremental investment, in India,"" it said.
Ambani, who wants to move his group to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, last month announced plans to invest 5.95 trillion rupees ($79 billion) to set up green energy projects including a 100 gigawatt renewable energy power plant.
The company operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamanagar.
""Subsequently, as hydrogen from syngas is replaced by green hydrogen, the entire syngas will be converted to chemicals.""

Ambani wants to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kg before the turn of this decade.

The National Medical Products Administration said Paxlovid is approved to treat adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and high risk of progressing to a severe condition. Further study on the drug needed to be conducted and submitted to the authority, it said.
It is not immediately clear if China is already in talks with Pfizer to procure the pill. 
""This is an important milestone in our fight against COVID-19,"" a Pfizer representative said in a statement, without providing information about procurement.
The approval is a boost to Pfizer which expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment.
Pfizer executives have said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to provide 120 million courses if needed.
While a number of vaccines are available worldwide to help prevent infection and serious illness, including one made by Pfizer, there are limited treatment options for people infected with COVID-19.
Pfizer in December said final trial results showed its treatment reduced the chance of hospitalisation or death by 89% in COVID-19 patients at risk of severe illness given the treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms, and by 88% when given within five days of onset.
The United States is paying around $530 for each course of Paxlovid and $700 for each course of rival COVID-19 pill molnupiravir developed by Merck & Co. 
China has kept daily number of new COVID-19 patients with confirmed symptoms to below 250, and sometimes fewer than 10, in the past year. 

The number is small for its 1.4 billion population and by global standards, thanks to China's approach of quickly containing any local flare-ups as soon as possible and its weeks-long quarantine requirement for most travellers arriving from abroad. 
China has yet to approve any COVID-19 vaccines developed by foreign drugmakers but has vaccinated 87.1% of its entire population by Feb. 7 using several domestically developed shots.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Ten former workers from Dyson's biggest parts supplier, Malaysian firm ATA IMS, are claiming compensation from the home appliance maker over poor working and living conditions at ATA factories, a law firm representing them said on Friday. 
The ex-employees allege that ""Dyson was unjustly enriched as a result of the unlawful, exploitative and dangerous conditions at the factory"", British law firm Leigh Day said in a statement.
A Dyson spokesperson told Reuters: ""These allegations relate to employees of ATA, not Dyson. If proceedings were to be issued we would robustly defend them.""
The company said it takes its responsibilities towards workers employed by its third-party suppliers ""extremely seriously"".
ATA, which makes parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, did not have an immediate comment on the claim.
Dyson said in November https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-dyson-terminates-relationship-with-malaysian-supplier-ata-over-labour-2021-11-25 it was severing relations with ATA, and ending its contract within six months, after an independent audit of the company's labour practices and accusations by a whistleblower. Dyson has not disclosed the findings of its audit.
Leigh Day has sent a ""letter before action"" to Singapore-headquartered Dyson on behalf of the workers and named four company units as the defendants in the claim, it said. The letter is a notice that legal proceedings could be initiated. 
""In the letter before action, sent by law firm Leigh Day on behalf of the workers, Dyson is asked to pay compensation to the workers. If a settlement cannot be reached the case will progress to the High Court,"" Leigh Day said in the statement. 
The letter was sent to Dyson on Dec. 10, Oliver Holland, a partner at Leigh Day, told Reuters.
Holland said Leigh Day may initiate judicial proceedings in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in March if Dyson does not engage in settlement talks. 
He said Leigh Day is representing the workers on a ""no win, no fee"" basis. 
Reuters reported on Nov. 25 https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-dyson-terminates-relationship-with-malaysian-supplier-ata-over-labour-2021-11-25 and Dec. 5 https://www.reuters.com/business/dyson-splits-with-malaysia-supplier-stoking-concern-over-migrant-worker-2021-12-05 that ATA's mostly migrant workforce did overtime hours exceeding Malaysia's legal limit of 104 per month, and worked on Sundays. Citing 11 employees, Reuters also reported on Dec 5 https://www.reuters.com/business/dyson-splits-with-malaysia-supplier-stoking-concern-over-migrant-worker-2021-12-05 that ATA had coached staff ahead of labour inspections to hide true working and living conditions, and employed foreigners without permits.
ATA acknowledged publicly on Dec. 7 some violations https://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-labour-dyson-ata-ims-idUSL4N2SS2PM, made some improvements, and said it now complies with all regulations and standards. 
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Dyson said it conducts frequent audits to monitor its supply chain and make improvements, and that it terminated its contract with ATA after the supplier failed to take swift action on a recent audit.
ATA was audited six times between 2019 and 2021, it said.

""During this period we demanded, and achieved, numerous improvements for ATA employees, including ensuring that more than 1,250 ATA workers had recruitment fees reimbursed to them on a point of principle,"" it said. 
""We received the results of the final inspection in October 2021, at which time it became clear to us that ATA management was not acting swiftly or vigorously enough to respond to Dyson's demands for further improvements. We therefore moved quickly to terminate our relationship, with six months' notice, enabling an orderly withdrawal.""

""After hybridisation, we will wait to see whether it will be possible to offer vehicles with an internal combustion engine beyond 2030,"" he told Welt am Sonntag.
""One possibility would be to keep combustion engine vehicles alive via synthetic fuels.""

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global shares dropped on Friday on rising worries over escalating Ukraine-Russia tensions and the prospect of a tightened interest rate hike timeline from the U.S. Federal Reserve in response to decades-high inflation.
Benchmark Treasury yields lost ground, and German bond yields backed off the 2018 highs struck on Thursday. Gold and oil prices rose.
Losses deepened in volatile trading on Wall Street after Washington said Russia had massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion, and urged U.S. citizens to leave the country within 48 hours after Moscow stiffened its response to Western diplomacy.
Rising oil prices boosted energy shares more than 2.8%, though most of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by technology and consumer discretionary.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 503.53 points, or 1.43%, at 34,738.06; the S&P 500 lost 85.44 points, or 1.90%, at 4,418.64; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 394.49 points, or 2.78%, to 13,791.15.
""By pushing energy prices even higher, a Russian invasion would likely exacerbate inflation and redouble pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank.
""From the Fed's perspective, the inflationary effects of a Russian invasion and higher energy prices would likely outweigh the shock's negative implications for global growth.""
Markets were already reeling from a Labor Department report on Thursday showing U.S. inflation at its hottest level in four decades, fueling concerns that the Fed could begin hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many had anticipated.
Those concerns were heightened after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Bloomberg he wanted a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three central bank policy meetings.
Financial markets are fully pricing in a rate hike of at least 25 basis points from the Fed at its March 15-16 policy meeting and are forecasting a 71.5% chance of a 50-basis-point hike, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch Tool.
""We really won't know what the Fed is going to do until it happens,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""There's a lot more data between now and the next Fed meeting for them to access.""
""There's little chance the Fed will not act, but I continue to believe we'll see signs of moderating inflation between now and the Fed meeting and a 25 basis point hike is the more likely move,"" Ghriskey added.
Interest rate sensitive tech shares weighed on European stocks as high U.S. inflation raised the odds of a more aggressive Fed.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.6% lower, but added 1.6% this week, its best performance since late-December.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 nations, fell 10.85 points or 1.49%, to 715.46. Emerging markets stocks fell 0.85%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.73% lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.42%.

The euro weakened 0.77%, following a warning from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde that raising interest rates would only hurt the economy.
Oil prices ended up 3% at seven-year highs as escalating fears of an invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a top energy producer, added to concerns over tight global crude supplies.
Brent crude futures settled $3.03, or 3.3%, higher at $94.44 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $3.22, or 3.6%, to $93.10 a barrel.

Investing.com - - The S&P 500 slumped Friday, as reports that Russia was in position to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine at any time triggered risk-off across markets just as investors were weighing up the prospect of aggressive U.S. rate hikes ahead.   
The S&P 500 fell 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4%, or 503 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.8%.
U.S. National Security Jake Sullivan Advisor told reporters on Friday that the U.S. is not claiming that Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine. An earlier report by PBS suggested the Russian president had already made a decision to invade.
""We are not saying that a decision has been taken a final decision has been taken by President Putin ... what we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we are seeing on the ground [at the Ukraine border],"" Sullivan said.
The national security advisor, however, emphasized the elevated threat of a Ukraine invasion that could begin ""any day now,"" as Russia had all the forces at the border that it needs to conduct a major military action.
An earlier report from PBS suggested that the Russian president had instructed his military to move ahead with the Ukraine invasion, with two administration officials reportedly saying an invasion was expected to begin next week.
{{twitter {""link"":""https://twitter.com/nickschifrin/status/1492203844155150339""}}}

The report of a decision from Putin arrived just after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Russia had beefed up its forces at the border with Ukraine and could launch an invasion at any time.
Investors opted for safety, piling into U.S. bonds pushing yields lower, with the U.S. 10-year yield retreating below 2% while expectations for potential disruptions in the oil supplies boosted oil prices. 
Defense stocks, meanwhile, including  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) (NYSE:LMT), and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) (NYSE:NOC) were higher.
Stocks started the day under pressure as investors weighed up the prospect of the Federal Reserve moving faster and more aggressively on rate hikes following St. Louis Fed President James Bullard's hawkish remarks on the heels of red-hot inflation report released Thursday.
Bullard said he was in favor of the Fed hiking rates by a full percentage point by July, and also backed hikes in between Fed meetings.
""Every data point like the inflation report we had yesterday confirms that inflation is a large and growing issue for the markets,"" Every one of those data points continues to reinforce how the Fed arguably is behind the curve,"" Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
Growth sectors of the market like tech led the broader market selloff as investors weighed up the growing prospect of the Fed raising rates by 50 basis point rate at its next meeting in March.
""The reality of what a rising rate environment means for growth stocks and how difficult it will most likely be for growth stocks to outperform given that general headwind is a reality that a lot of investors, especially ones that are newer, don't recognize,"" Keller added.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day in the red.
With tech in the crosshairs once again, value sectors such as financials and energy have been touted as the place to hide in an inflationary and rising environment. But the recent run up in financials, up 2.6%, and energy up 27%, especially the latter is due for a pullback, which would likely be bought on the dip.
""Energy will probably have to pull back a bit, but overall, those sectors [financials and energy] still remain the sectors with the highest probability of outperforming,"" according to Keller."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin's defamation case against the New York Times is heading to a jury, after her lawyer accused the newspaper of falsely associating her in a 2017 editorial with a mass murder, a link that a Times lawyer said was an honest mistake. 
In his closing argument in federal court in Manhattan, Palin's lawyer Kenneth Turkel said the Times and its former editorial page editor, James Bennet, turned a ""blind eye"" to the facts as it smeared the reputation of Palin, a former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate.
""The Times resurrected a horrific, false accusation (that) in its simplest form accused Governor Palin of inciting the murder of six people,"" he said. ""She's got thick skin. This one crossed the line.""
In response, Times lawyer David Axelrod said the editorial was an ""honest mistake"" and not meant as a ""political hit piece"" and that Palin offered no evidence it harmed her reputation, citing her continued public appearances after it was published.
""The criticism was of the New York Times for messing something up,"" Axelrod said. ""You saw no evidence that anyone criticized Governor Palin for what was written in the editorial. None, zip, zilch.""
He also urged jurors to consider the need for a robust press to cover news and express opinion, citing protections afforded by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
""The First Amendment is so important that honest mistakes do not create liability,"" he said. ""The evidence does not support branding him (Bennet) with a scarlet 'D' for defamation for the rest of his life.""
Jurors will begin deliberating later Friday.
The trial is in its seventh day, and is being closely watched by First Amendment advocates.
Palin, 58, has said she may use the case to challenge longstanding protections for U.S. news media against defamation claims by public figures.
Jurors must decide whether Palin proved with clear and convincing evidence that the Times and Bennet acted with ""actual malice,"" https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-times-palin-idUKKBN25O31B meaning they knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
The ""actual malice"" standard came from New York Times v. Sullivan, a landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision. Palin has signaled she will challenge that standard on appeal if she lost.
The former governor is seeking unspecified damages. She cannot obtain punitive damages.
CORRECTING A LINK
The lawsuit concerns ""America's Lethal Politics,"" a June 14, 2017, editorial addressing gun control and lamenting the deterioration of political discourse.
It incorrectly linked Palin to the January 2011 shooting https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-congresswoman-factbox/factbox-congresswoman-gabrielle-giffords-shot-idUSTRE70723F20110108 in a Tucson, Arizona, parking lot where six people were killed and then-Democratic U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded.
The editorial was written after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, where Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise was among the wounded https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-shooting/scalise-in-critical-condition-after-attack-by-gunman-at-baseball-field-idUSKBN1951M1.
Bennet inserted language that drew an incorrect connection between the Giffords shooting and a map circulated by Palin's political action committee that the editorial said placed 20 Democrats, including Giffords, under crosshairs.
""The link to political incitement was clear,"" the editorial said. It was corrected the following morning, and Bennet testified during the trial that he never intended to blame Palin or her political action committee.
In her own testimony, Palin spoke about being a mother and grandmother still living in her Wasilla, Alaska, hometown, likening herself to the biblical underdog David against the Times' Goliath.
She said the editorial left her feeling ""powerless"" and ""mortified,"" upset her sleep, and caused people to think less of her.
But while Palin's public profile has long been lower than in 2008, she failed to offer specific examples of how the editorial hurt her reputation or caused her harm.

Turkel said none of that excused the Times.
""All they had to do is care the slightest bit,"" he said. ""All they had to do is dislike her a little less, and we're not sitting here today.""

The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5%, or 526 points, the Nasdaq fell 3.1%.
U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday that the U.S. is not claiming that Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine, casting doubt on an earlier report by PBS that suggested the Russian president had made his decision to invade.
""We are not saying that a decision has been taken a final decision has been taken by President Putin ... what we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we are seeing on the ground [at the Ukraine border],"" Sullivan said.
The national security advisor, however, emphasized the elevated threat of a Ukraine invasion that could begin ""any day now,"" as Russia had all the forces at the border that it needs to conduct a major military action.
An earlier report from PBS suggested that the Russian president had instructed his military to move ahead with the Ukraine invasion, with two administration officials reportedly saying an invasion was expected to begin next week.


The report of a decision from Putin arrived just after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Russia had beefed up its forces at the border with Ukraine and could launch an invasion at any time.
Investors opted for safety, piling into U.S. bonds pushing yields lower, with the U.S. 10-year yield retreating below 2%.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -A variety of U.S.-based groups are organizing convoys of trucks and other vehicles for this weekend and early next month, emulating the protests against COVID-19 mandates that have roiled Canada https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-protests-enter-third-week-sophisticated-demonstrators-dig-2022-02-11 and disrupted North American supply lines.
An organization dubbed ""Convoy to Save America"" said on its website that two separate vehicle convoys will converge this weekend at the Peace Bridge, a U.S.-Canadian border crossing in Buffalo, New York. One of the convoys will leave New York City on Friday and the second from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, on Saturday.
Pennie Fay, one of the group's founders, told Reuters that the convoys will consist of sports utility vehicles and minivans filled with supplies such as water, food, gas cards and blankets for Canadian truck drivers who arrive on the U.S. side. 
""This weekend is about the Canadians, about supporting them,"" said Fay, who is leaving from Nashville, ""while at the same time bringing attention to the fact that we want the mandates gone. Remove them from state to state. We want a free country."" 
In Canada, the trucker protest is entering its third week. Beginning as a protest over a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, its scope has expanded to include a more generalized opposition to government rules set up to control the spread of the virus over the past two years.
Truck drivers have occupied the Canadian capital of Ottawa and now are blocking the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest international land border crossing in North America and a critical lifeline for the automotive industry, between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. Truckers have also blocked smaller border crossings in Canada's Alberta and Manitoba provinces.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency on Friday.
Calls for financial help for U.S. and Canadian truckers have been created on fundraising websites. A campaign on the Christian fundraising site Givesendgo.com has raised more than $8 million for Canadian truckers while another has raised more than $41,000 for truckers in the United States. 
Some U.S. Republicans have vowed to investigate GoFundMe after it took down a page accepting donations in support of protesting truck drivers. 
On Friday, during a protest against New York's school mask mandates in Buffalo, demonstrators put money into cans that were passed around for donations for Canadian truckers. Demonstrators also rolled around a wheelbarrow that they filled with coins and bills for the truck drivers.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned law enforcement agencies of a possible convoy of protesting truckers gathering at this weekend's Super Bowl in Los Angeles, according to several media reports. 
The agency said in a statement that it is tracking reports of a potential convoy traveling to several U.S. cities, but the statement did not allude to the Super Bowl. 
A variety of U.S. groups are organizing on social media platforms such as Telegram, TikTok and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), aiming to tap into frustration that appears to be growing among Americans over COVID-19 mandates. In some cases, logistics for possible large convoys across the nation are part of those discussions. 

One of the efforts, dubbed ""The People's Convoy,"" which has 64,000 followers on Facebook, is planning a rally in Coachella Valley in Indio, California, on March 4. Truck drivers will then convoy from California and other parts of the country to Washington, D.C., to show their disapproval over mandates.
""It's happening whether you like it or not, it's going to happen,"" Brian Brase, one of the group's organizers, said in a TikTok post. ""It's not a right issue. It's not a left issue. It's not an anti-vax thing. It's about the constitution and our rights as Americans."" Brase could not be reached immediately for further comments.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 03:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Fed staff reported securities trades -WSJ,"(Reuters) -Two senior U.S. Federal Reserve staffers reported a series of financial market trades in early 2020 at a time when the central bank was putting in place emergency measures to prop up the economy at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Wall Street Journal reported https://on.wsj.com/33jP8rC on Friday.
John Stevens and Diana Hancock, both currently senior associate directors in the Fed's research and statistics division, reported in official financial disclosure forms a series of trades in February and March 2020.
Stevens reported 46 financial trades on Feb. 27 and Feb. 28, 2020, buying and selling individual company stocks, mutual funds and other investments. 
The securities were part of a 2019 inheritance that was the sole property of Stevens' spouse Dominique Casimir-Stevens, she told Reuters after the newspaper published its report. 
""I had a financial advisor rebalance those investments for me in order to bring them into compliance with the ethics rules. It is that rebalancing that resulted in the large number of transactions that my husband disclosed,"" she said. 
""I am devastated that my dad's unexpected death and the actions we took to comply with the rules are now being used to tarnish my husband's good name and public service.""
Hancock's disclosures included a sale of over $1 million in an exchange-traded fund, which holds shares in selected companies, on Feb. 27. Hancock told the newspaper her spouse made the trades, and she didn’t have any control over those transactions.
The disclosure forms do not distinguish between trades by staff and those of their spouses.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, on Feb. 28, 2020, indicated the central bank would cut interest rates if needed, which it did in early March, the same month it launched a slew of programs to keep financial conditions loose and spur lending. 
The Fed has come under scrutiny after disclosures of securities trading by Fed presidents and Fed governors during the pandemic. Unlike Fed staffers, Fed policymakers have access to the full range of policy-relevant deliberations and materials. 
Powell has since announced new ethics rules governing financial holdings and dealings at the central bank and an investigation by the central bank's inspector general is underway.

Questions remain about how much back and forth may have occurred over policymakers’ personal trading in a year when markets first cratered, then rebounded on the basis of both massive federal fiscal stimulus and an aggressive rescue effort by the Fed.
Earlier this week, the Fed, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request by Reuters, said there are about 60 pages of correspondence https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fed-denies-release-correspondence-pandemic-trades-made-by-policymakers-2022-02-09 between its ethics officials and policymakers regarding financial transactions conducted during 2020 but ""denied in full"" to release the documents, citing exemptions under the information act that it said applied in this case.

263,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>","Under Armour flags hit to margins, supplies due to COVID-19 disruptions","(Reuters) -Under Armour Inc on Friday warned that higher transportation costs would squeeze its earnings in the current quarter, as the sportswear maker wrestles with COVID-19-led disruptions to its supply chain.
Shares fell 8.1% to $18.40 as the company flagged reductions to its spring and summer order book due to supply constraints.
Product availability has been a concern for Under Armour (NYSE:UA) and its rivals,  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), as Asian factories that make their clothing are only just recovering from COVID-19 outbreaks and employee shortages.
""We expect many of (supply) headwinds to continue well into fiscal 2023 until longer-than-usual transit times, backlogs and congestion find balance ... and inbound shipping delays subside,"" said Chief Financial Officer David Bergman on an earnings call.
The pandemic has triggered inflation across the supply chain from labor to raw materials, forcing corporate America to raise prices of everything from burgers to hoodies. However, many companies could still not fully offset the impact and that hit their profits.
Under Armour said gross margin would be down 200 basis points in the current quarter, compared with last year's adjusted gross margin, hurt by a 240 basis points hit from higher freight expenses.
It forecast earnings of 2 cents to 3 cents per share for the quarter ending March 31, which at least four analysts said was below estimates. 
The company has been forced to use pricier air freight due to port congestion, as it strives to ensure its shelves are sufficiently stocked, with demand for athletic wear still strong.

However, robust demand and higher prices helped Under Armour post better-than-expected results for the holiday quarter.
Net revenue rose 9% to $1.53 billion, beating estimates of $1.47 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 14 cents, five cents above expectations.

(Reuters) -Democratic U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith have asked the Department of Labor to deny Swiss lender  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG a regulatory exemption related to its management of retirement funds as a result of a Justice Department settlement for bribery, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.
The letter from Warren, one of the Senate's most influential lawmakers, will increase scrutiny on the Swiss bank, which is in the middle of a restructuring following a string of high-profile scandals. 
The senators sent the letter on Thursday to Ali Khawar, acting assistant secretary at the Employee Benefits Security Administration (ESBA) in the Department of Labor, raising concerns about ESBA's proposal to grant a one-year ""qualified professional asset manager"" (QPAM) exemption to Credit Suisse.
The bank is currently considered to be a QPAM, which gives it the right to manage or transact clients' 401(k) and pension plans. Under EBSA regulations, however, a financial entity is prevented from retaining QPAM status if it has been convicted of criminal activity involving trust management. 
The waiver would allow Credit Suisse to continue with business as usual. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment, and EBSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
It has long been standard practice for regulators to grant companies waivers from business restrictions triggered by misconduct charges provided they agree to a settlement. Democrats say the practice allows companies to continue to re-offend with few consequences. 
""We urge you to reconsider and rescind this proposal, which would undermine efforts to hold Credit Suisse accountable for its illegal behavior,"" the senators wrote. 
The letter cited an October 2021 global resolution https://www.reuters.com/business/credit-suisse-pay-475-mln-resolve-charges-related-mozambican-bond-offerings-2021-10-19 the bank agreed for defrauding U.S. and international investors, and a previous 2014 conviction, as reasons to deny the exemption. 
Credit Suisse's European subsidiary pleaded guilty to defrauding investors over an $850 million loan to Mozambique meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet, and is paying U.S. and British regulators $475 million to settle the case under a deal announced in October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), said Friday the disruption at the Canadian border from trucking protests forced new production cuts at plants in Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Alabama and Ontario.
Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker, said a parts shortage stemming from the border disruption forced it to temporarily halt production at its assembly plant in Ohio.
Ford also said its plants in Oakville, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario are continuing to run at reduced capacity. Production at Ford's Avon Lake, Ohio assembly plant where it builds medium-duty and super duty F-Series pickup trucks was halted on Friday, it said.
Ford said separately it will suspend production next week at Avon Lake because of the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.
The ""Freedom Convoy"" by Canadian truckers opposing a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, mirrored by the U.S. government, began with the occupation of the Canadian capital, Ottawa. The truckers then blocked the Ambassador Bridge that connects Windsor and Detroit earlier this week, and shut down two other smaller border crossings.
The bridge is North America's busiest international land border crossing and a key supply route for Detroit's carmakers.
Toyota is trimming production at its engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama.
""We expect disruptions through the weekend, and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed,"" said Toyota, the largest Japanese automaker.
Toyota said on Thursday it would halt production at its Ontario and Kentucky plants through Saturday because of parts shortages tied to the protests.
Chrysler-parent Stellantis said its North America plants began operations Friday morning ""but a number of U.S. and Canadian plants have cut short multiple shifts throughout the week due to parts shortages caused by the closure of the Detroit/Windsor bridge.""
Honda said it was temporarily suspending manufacturing on one production line during the day shift at its plant in Alliston, Ontario.

General Motors, which halted work at a Michigan auto plant on Thursday because of the border issues, said it trimmed production at auto plants in Michigan and Ontario Friday.
GM said production was cut during the first shift at its Flint Assembly plant where it builds pickup trucks and its CAMI Assembly in Ontario where it builds the Chevrolet Equinox. Production was scheduled to resume normally during the second shift.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 01:41PM ET</span>",U.S. poultry producers harden safety measures as bird flu spreads,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. poultry producers are tightening safety measures for their flocks as disease experts warn that wild birds are likely spreading a highly lethal form of avian flu across the country.
Indiana on Wednesday reported highly pathogenic bird flu on a commercial turkey farm, leading China, South Korea and Mexico to ban poultry imports from the state. The outbreak put the U.S. industry on edge at a time that labor shortages are fueling food inflation.
The disease is already widespread in Europe and affecting Africa, Asia and Canada, but the outbreak in Indiana, which is on a migratory bird pathway, particularly rattled U.S. producers. A devastating U.S. bird-flu outbreak in 2015 killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly turkeys and egg-laying chickens in the Midwest.
The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. 
""Everyone is just sitting on edge because we know what can happen and we don't want a repeat of that,"" said Denise Heard, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, an industry group.
Poultry company Perdue Farms suspended in-person visits to farms to avoid spreading the disease, spokeswoman Diana Souder said.
Iowa's Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said a confirmed case in the country meant heightened risk for all.
""It's time to move to a higher alert for our livestock producers,"" Naig said.
Disease experts said a wild bird likely spread the H5N1 virus, which can be transmitted to humans, to Indiana from the East Coast, where officials have confirmed that wild ducks were infected with the strain.
The U.S. Agriculture Department called the disease low risk to people.
HEIGHTENED SECURITY
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) heightened biosecurity measures in its East Coast facilities after the wild bird infections, the company said on an earnings call on Monday. It said it reduced the number of trips to farms and started taking more time to clean vehicles.
Wild birds from the East Coast may have mixed with those that fly through a migratory path called the Mississippi Flyway that includes Indiana and major poultry-producing states, such as Mississippi and Alabama, experts said. 
To better track the disease, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday it will expand monitoring of wild birds to the Mississippi Flyway and another migratory pathway, the Central Flyway, that includes Texas and Nebraska.
""It's very likely that it can be all over the states - from the East Coast to the West Coast,"" Heard said.
Other commercial poultry flocks may become infected as wild birds traverse flyways, though producers have improved safety measures since 2015, said Carol Cardona, an avian health professor at the University of Minnesota. 
In one key change, farms often require people who enter poultry barns to change their boots and clothing so they do not bring in contaminated materials like feces or feathers.
""We recognize that the virus could be right outside the door,"" Cardona said.
There have been more than 700 outbreaks of bird flu in Europe, with more than 20 countries affected since October 2021. Tens of millions of birds have been culled.
Britain's government reported that the country was suffering its worst-ever bird flu season, while Italy has the highest number of outbreaks at more than 300. Hungary, Poland and France have also recorded significant numbers of cases.
The disease hit the United States at a time when poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14% from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23%.
In Indiana, officials are testing poultry farms in a 10-kilometer control area around the infected farm in Dubois County. The state said on Thursday that all tests were negative but that testing will continue on a weekly basis.

Those negative tests have not relaxed James Watson, the state veterinarian in Mississippi, the fifth-biggest chicken-meat-producing state. He said wild ducks will likely continue to spread the virus until warmer weather sends them to northern breeding grounds.
""Even if they resolve this with no other issues, we're still going to be on high alert,"" Watson said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) is injecting new cash into oil trading in Europe after a retreat on its ambitious expansion plans last year, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
Exxon slashed funding for its trading division in 2020 as part of wider cuts, leaving traders without the capital they needed to take full advantage of the volatile oil market during peak COVID-19 lockdowns. 
The company’s cautious strategy during the pandemic sparked the exodus of some senior-level recruits from the previous couple of years, along with Exxon veterans, after they were restricted to routine hedging and deals.
Among the senior departures Reuters reported last year, Paul Butcher was due to leave in September but then stayed after Exxon decided to allocate more financing, the sources said, without providing further detail.
The sources said Exxon would keep its trading expansion going. Butcher is now expanding the paper market team in Exxon's office outside London, which would see Exxon engage in speculative trade beyond hedging their own oil, they said. 
Angela Cranmer moved internally to join his team in January this year, according to LinkedIn and two sources. She was previously a senior middle distillates trader, her LinkedIn profile showed. The sources added that Exxon was still looking to expand with internal and external hires. 
The company also hired two refined products traders, Jon Hives and James Clements, who joined the team in Brussels in January as part of the expansion, two sources said. According to LinkedIn, Hives joined in January. 

“Our active trading program continues to grow, and we’re pleased with the progress we are making,” Julie King, an Exxon spokesperson said, but declined to comment on the specific hires.
Last week, Exxon reported its biggest profit in seven years in the fourth quarter of 2021 on the back of soaring energy prices.

(Reuters) -Apollo Global Management Inc posted a 52% jump in fourth-quarter distributable earnings on Friday on the back of strong growth in management and advisory fees in its credit business and said it was not worried about interest rate rises.
The New York-based firm said its distributable earnings, which is cash available to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to $483 million in the three months to Dec. 31, up from $317.4 million a year earlier. 
Apollo shares were trading down 2.4% at $68 per share in early afternoon in New York after the earnings fell short of many analysts' expectations. Apollo's distributable earnings per share of $1.05 was slightly lower than the average analyst estimate of $1.10, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. 
While Apollo capitalized on strong markets at the end of 2021 to cash out on some of its investments, it did so at a slower pace than its major peers. It generated $4.2 billion in proceeds from exiting positions in the fourth quarter, down from $8.8 billion in the prior quarter.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, Carlyle Inc, and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc have reported record fourth-quarter earnings that outperformed analyst estimates.
The equity segments of these firms were a major driver of their performance. Apollo, on the other hand, generates most of its earnings from its credit business, where assets outnumber those in its equity divisions by a factor of three to one.
Apollo Chief Executive Marc Rowan said the firm was well-positioned for an expected rise in interest rates because its credit business was not dependant on borrowing costs remaining low.
""The way we have earned excess return is through origination or taking some amount of liquidity risk rather than subordination risk, credit risk or duration risk,"" Rowan said on Apollo's earnings call on Friday.
Apollo said it deployed $34.6 billion on new investments in the fourth quarter, mostly in its credit division. Its fee-related earnings reached a record $309 million.
Corporate credit and structured credit funds gained 0.9% and 3%, respectively, while the private equity portfolio gained 5.2%. Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR reported appreciation in their private equity funds of 4.8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. 
Under generally accepted accounting priniciples (GAAP), net income fell 45% to $234.4 million, compared with $425 million in the previous year, owing to a drop in investment income and a nearly threefold rise in its compensation expenses. 

It booked about $1 billion as a one-time, non-cash charge from a previously announced plan to replace carried interest payments to executives with bumper stock awards.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 12:46PM ET</span>","Exclusive-EU, Gates Foundation to support African medicines agency -source","By Francesco Guarascio and Wendell Roelf
BRUSSELS/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -The European Union and the Gates Foundation are set to announce financial support for nascent efforts to set up an African medicines regulator to boost the continent's drugs and vaccine production, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The treaty establishing the African Medicines Agency (AMA) came into force in November but the agency currently exists only on paper. So far just over half of the 55 African Union (AU) member states have ratified the treaty setting up the AMA.
Financial and technical support to the new agency is seen as crucial to help it to begin operations. This in turn would be a boost for the continent's vaccine and drugs industry, which needs a trusted regulator to flourish.
The European Commission, Germany, France, Belgium, and the Gates Foundation will invest more than 100 million euros ($113.93 million) to support AMA and African national regulatory agencies, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters on Friday.
The goal is to allow these agencies to achieve what the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as Maturity Level 3 for vaccine producing, which is ""the minimum WHO requirement for effective regulatory oversight for quality local vaccine production,"" the official said.
According to an internal EU Commission document with slides, seen by Reuters, part of the money will be in grants and will also go to the European Medicines Agency.
EMA, which is as yet the only continent-wide drugs regulator, will ""provide technical assistance to African counterparts via scientific collaboration, joint inspections, training, and notably the AMA,"" the document says.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged African countries to back efforts to set up the regulator as it could help fight counterfeit or poor-quality drugs.
“I believe that this institution will be very, very important for the continent,"" he said in Cape Town. ""I would like... to (appeal) to all countries who haven’t ratified to ratify and speed up the establishment (of AMA).”
At an earlier event, the WHO's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said the AMA could play ""the kind of role that the European Medicines Agency has played in Europe – setting the standards, helping countries develop their regulatory agencies."" 
ENDING DEPENDENCE
The race to establish the AMA comes after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the region's dependence on imported vaccines and other pharmaceuticals. Just over 5% of medicines, and 1% of vaccines, consumed by the population of 1.2 billion people are produced locally. 
Africa initially struggled to get COVID-19 vaccine doses as rich countries snapped up limited supplies. Deliveries to the continent later picked up, but just 10% of Africans are fully vaccinated.
Efforts are now under way to increase production but a regulator is necessary to approve drugs.
Preparing for future pandemics is only one reason a continental regulator is crucial for Africa, experts say. 
Disparate regulations across 54 countries, and scant transparency, have led some pharmaceutical companies to drop efforts to register their products, leading to limited availability of important medicines in many African nations. 
A lack of stringent oversight has enabled counterfeit drugs to flood African markets, in some cases causing needless deaths and fuelling scepticism of medicine. 
The EU's push to support the new regulator is part of a broad strategy to check Chinese and Russian influence in Africa, bloc officials in Brussels told Reuters. Brussels has donated hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses to Africa in the past year.
Vaccines access will also be a key issue at a summit of EU and African Union leaders next week in Brussels.
A senior AU official, Margaret Agama-Anyetei, who is leading efforts to set up the AMA, said getting more AU member states to sign and ratify the treaty is one of the most urgent priorities.

""Across the continent there is a plethora of fake certificates, fake drugs, fake masks and fake medicine, and it’s really important that we have a continental agency which is complimentary to all other national health institutions and invested in promoting the regulation of medical products across the continent,"" she told Reuters in a phone interview from the Ethiopian capital.

HELSINKI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Finland has sealed a deal to buy dozens of F-35 stealth warplanes from the United States, in a sign of its military's close ties with NATO at a time of high tension between the West and Russia in Europe.
The northern European nation - which borders Russia and was historically neutral during the Cold War - signed the $9.4 billion agreement on Friday to buy 64 radar-evading  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) jets.
While the planes will not enter service for several years - non-NATO Finland has previously said 2027 - the agreement reflects the country's deepening cooperation with the Western military alliance and how its defence forces materiel policy is based on all new equipment being NATO-compatible. 
Finland's government said the decision to buy the U.S. jets, announced in December https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lockheed-f-35-jet-wins-finnish-fighter-competition-source-2021-12-10, was part of long-term plans to boost the country's defences, not a response to the current confrontation between the West and Russia over Ukraine.
""It is part of our long-term planning and has nothing to do with the current situation as such,"" said Mikko Hautala, Finland's ambassador to the United States.
Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near its frontiers with Ukraine, and Western countries fear it is planning an attack. Moscow denies plans for an invasion but says it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless demands are met, including a promise to admit no new countries to NATO and to withdraw Western forces from Eastern Europe.
Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finlands-pm-says-nato-membership-is-very-unlikely-her-watch-2022-01-19 in January the country had no plans at present to apply to join NATO, but added that his nation retained the right to join. 
MISSILES TOO
The contract with the U.S. government and planemaker Lockheed Martin includes maintenance equipment, spare parts and training services, Finland's Defence Forces said.
""The aim is to ensure that Finland's F-35 system has the best possible performance going into the 2030s,"" it added.

On top of the F-35s, Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen decided on Friday that Finland would buy surface-to-surface missiles from Lockheed for 75 million euros to improve the performance and extend the range of it's heavy rocket launcher system, the Defence Ministry said in a statement.
The munition deliveries are estimated to begin in 2025, it added. The surface-to-surface missiles have a range of over 135 kilometres and could be used offensively or as a deterrent to land invasion.

Investing.com –  Yelp  stock (NYSE:YELP) surged 9% Friday after the company beat fourth-quarter estimates and promised another year of robust growth.
The company expects 2022 net revenue to be $1.16 billion to $1.18 billion, growth of over 14% at the top end. This follows an 18% jump in annual revenue that topped $1 billion in 2021, exceeding its pre-pandemic performance. Ad clicks rose by 24% in the year.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose more than 17% to cross $273 million, riding a recovery in spending as more consumers stepped out and logged on to its platform for reviews of restaurants, bars and beauty salons.
Cumulative reviews increased by 9% year over year to exceed 244 million as of December 31, with 2021 along bringing in 20 million of them. The company scaled Yelp Connect, a paid product that provides advertisers with a channel to market new offerings to customers.
Advertising revenue from services businesses and robustness in home services category grew strongly. Adjusted profit per share rose 3 cents to 30 cents and well ahead of estimates.
Yelp is working on a plan to reduce its office space. It has $232 million remaining under its repurchase program, and plans to keep using part of it to buy back shares.

(Reuters) -Enbridge Inc reported a nearly 4% jump in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, as a recovery in fuel demand boosted the Canadian pipeline operator's oil transportation volumes, but it missed earnings expectations.
Pipeline operators have benefited from a pick-up in volumes with crude prices trading at multi-year highs.
Oil prices have soared as the Omicron-driven COVID-19 wave failed to reduce global mobility as much as feared, and as crude producers have resisted big boosts to output, with many countries targeting fossil fuels emissions.
""Just cutting to the chase, we're in the middle of an energy crisis,"" Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said on a conference call with analysts. ""Normally we see a supply response, but not this time, given significant underinvestment in both conventional (energy) and renewables.""
Along with transporting oil and gas, Enbridge produces offshore wind power in Europe, and is developing renewable natural gas and carbon capture businesses.
Monaco said Enbridge will continue to capitalize on demand for moving oil and gas and gradually scale up investments in lower-emitting energies, likely starting within two to three years.
Enbridge said it transported 3.01 million barrels per day (bpd) on its Mainline system in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.65 million bpd a year earlier.
The Calgary-based company's earnings rose to C$1.84 billion ($1.45 billion), or 91 Canadian cents per share, in the period, from C$1.775 billion, or 88 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Enbridge earned 68 Canadian cents, falling short of analysts' average expectation of 76 Canadian cents, according to Refinitiv data.

Enbridge shares were trading 1% higher on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 11:48AM ET</span>",European fast grocery hits speed bump with Dutch halt on new 'dark stores',"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Venture capitalists have invested billions of dollars in fast grocery delivery services such as Turkey's Getir and Germany's Gorillas and Flink, in a race to expand across Europe to meet soaring demand during COVID-19 lockdowns.
But this new mainstay of city life is facing pushback from some residents and authorities who see the services as a blight on neighbourhoods, complicating the loss-making companies' efforts to scale up and become profitable.
At issue are the hundreds of small ""dark stores"" - distribution hubs for on-demand groceries where workers zip in and out on scooters, prompting complaints they are causing disruptions and are a nuisance.
Amsterdam and Rotterdam have reacted by slapping a one-year freeze on new dark stores. Other cities could follow in moves similar to those faced in Europe by ride-hailing service Uber (NYSE:UBER) and short-term home rental company AirBnB.
""The business model of these companies is that they want to deliver groceries in 10 minutes, that means they need to be based in neighbourhoods. That's exactly the place where they also cause nuisance,"" Amsterdam deputy mayor Marieke van Doornick said.
""This is not something that is happening specially in Amsterdam, this is happening in most big cities.""
In London's Islington and Berlin's Kreuzberg neighbourhoods, residents have complained about the noise. In Paris, the deputy mayor has decried unmarked stores as a blight on the cityscape and called for them to seek licences as warehouses or face ""financial consequences and penalties.""
Complaints include restocking and delivery going on 24 hours a day as well as traffic hazards from racing scooters.
""So we need to find out if that's possible in a safe way, or they need to go places where they may not be able to deliver in 10 minutes,"" Van Doornick said.
Industrial zones outside town are an option, she said -- even if that does not suit the companies' business model.
The three largest fast grocery companies in Amsterdam, Flink, Gorillas, and Getir, all pointed to the many customers satisfied with their services and say they want to work with city officials to resolve the problems.
Solutions that may hurt already thin margins would be operating during restricted hours or making extra space for couriers and their vehicles inside the tiny stores.
But a one-year freeze on new dark stores coming just after the companies received huge amounts of capital could torpedo their efforts to grab market share.
'SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED'
Flink, founded in Berlin in 2020, raised $1.1 billion last year and had planned to double its presence in Amsterdam by opening 10 new stores this year -- including in some locations where it has already signed a lease. It says it is reviewing the legality of the freeze.
Gorillas, also founded in Berlin in 2020, raised $1.3 billion in 2021 from investors including Delivery Hero, said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the bans, which would force it to use existing hubs more heavily. It may have the most dark stores in Europe with 180 at last count, employing 2,000 in Amsterdam alone.
Founded in Istanbul in 2015, peer Getir raised more than $1.1 billion last year, counting Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital among its backers. It launched in Britain in January, in the Netherlands in May, in Germany and France in June, and bought rival Blok in July to expand to Spain, Italy and Portugal.
European General Manager Berker Yağcı said the company was already profitable in some districts, but its vision required reaching scale and winning repeat customers.
He said the company had created 1,500 Dutch jobs so far. ""We'd like to continue to do that and multiply that number this year and into the future,"" he added.
But ""if a freeze is to be continued for a whole year...it will affect our ability to serve our customers.""
A halt on growth of the companies in city centres could also benefit their biggest rivals: meal delivery services including Just Eat Takeaway and Deliveroo, which are striking deals to handle delivery for existing supermarket chains.
 SimilarWeb  (NYSE:SMWB), which tracks the popularity of software apps, said while meal apps remain more popular, fast grocery apps are making inroads.

Lucas Pettinato noted Getir was winning ground in Britain since October and in Germany since the start of 2022.
""Getir’s European performance over the last few months shows that there is growth potential for the quick-delivery industry,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Auto parts maker  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc said on Friday disruptions at the Ambassador bridge caused by Canadian trucker protests against coronavirus mandates have started to have some initial impact on its operations.
The protesters, who have caused a gridlock in the Canadian capital since late January, have since Monday used their big rigs to snarl traffic at the bridge, which serves as a supply route for Detroit's carmakers.
The situation at the bridge has forced some customers to idle or cut production requirements, Magna Chief Executive Officer Swamy Kotagiri said on an earnings call.
""If the gridlock lasts for longer, it could affect big Canadian suppliers such as Magna and Linamar Corp and it might affect Magna's bottom-line numbers in the (current) quarter,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.
U.S.-listed shares of Magna dropped nearly 4.3% to $77.42, while its Toronto stock fell 4.4% to C$98.50. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis have said they have been forced to cancel or scale back some production due to the protests.
The protests have piled more pressure on a North American auto industry wrestling with a fragile supply chain and a global chip shortage that has wreaked havoc with production since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Magna reported a 13.7% drop in fourth-quarter net sales to $9.11 billion, but beat analysts' estimates of $8.95 billion.
In terms of headwinds, expect continued semiconductor supply constraints to impact production in 2022, CEO Kotagiri said on the call.
However, the company expects semiconductor availability to impact production more significantly in the first half of the year.

The Ontario-based company estimated full-year revenue of $38.8 billion to $40.4 billion, compared with the $36.24 billion it reported for 2021. 
Analysts on average were expecting $39.47 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday it was offering $69 million to 127 aviation manufacturing and repair businesses under a COVID-19 relief program created by Congress in 2021.
In total, the department has offered $673 million nationwide in three rounds of awards. Some previously offered awards were not ultimately paid.
The $3 billion aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program covers up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for up to six months. Grantees may not conduct furloughs without employee consent or lay off workers covered by subsidies during that period.
The application process is now closed. It is unclear what will happen to the undistributed funds.
Among the 593 awards granted are $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), $20.9 million for Connecticut-based Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) Corp, $17.5 million to BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Controls, $12.9 million to Airbus' U.S arm, $15 million to Learjet, a unit of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc, and $12.5 million to Dassault Falcon Jet Corp.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, was offered about $40 million for various U.S. units.
The department said the awards will support 31,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs in 43 states.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the funding will help ""keep America's aviation industry strong as it continues its robust recovery.""

To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue.
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell said Friday ""supporting aerospace manufacturing employers during an unprecedented aviation industry slowdown is not only the right thing to do, it's the best way to keep local economies diverse and thriving.""

With both ISS and Glass Lewis coming out against the deal after a number of prominent shareholders also opposed it, chances are dwindling that the software company's shareholders will sign it off when they vote later this month.
""We believe Zendesk's proposed acquisition of Momentive could readily be characterized as a case of, 'ready, fire, aim',"" Glass Lewis analysts wrote in a note, adding, ""we recommend shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal.""
ISS wrote ""support for this proposal is not warranted,"" and noted there were so many questions about revenue synergies and financial projections that it ""had the potential to become that rarest of special situations, a merger that is disliked by shareholders of both the seller and the buyer.""
Zendesk agreed to buy Momentive in October in an all-cash deal valued at roughly $4 billion. Investors, including activist hedge fund Jana Partners, quickly spoke out against the proposal, criticizing its financial merit and logic.
Glass Lewis agreed and wrote: ""We do not believe Zendesk investors — perhaps seeking some stability in the wake of the Company's seesawing quarterly performance — have been afforded persuasive reason to conclude the Company is well positioned to efficiently realize the lofty objectives underpinning the Momentive transaction.""
On Thursday, Zendesk said that it had received takeover interest of its own but had rejected a $127 to $132 a share bid from a group of private equity firms and wanted to push on with plans to buy Momentive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican U.S. senators who have been negotiating for weeks on a bipartisan bill to punish Russia for its troop build up near Ukraine said they have reached an impasse, although aides said on Friday they continue to look for a way forward.
Senators from both parties had said for weeks they wanted to act quickly to boost Ukraine with sanctions on Russia and more military assistance for Kyiv, in what seemed to be a rare incidence of bipartisan cooperation in a bitterly divided Congress. 
A group of about five Democrats and five Republican Senators had been involved in talks on a bill for weeks, but left Washington for the weekend without an agreement. 
""We're at a stalemate,"" an aide said, adding that lawmakers were nonetheless trying to find another way forward.
Russia has been building up its forces on Ukraine's borders for months and demanded NATO pull troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar the former Soviet state from ever joining the U.S.-led military alliance. The West has said those main demands are non-starters. 
The two main sticking points in the discussions among U.S. Senators are disagreement over how to handle the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and a proposal to impose secondary sanctions on all Russian banks.
Republicans have been pushing to slap sanctions on the pipeline, which would transport gas to Germany, but Democrats say doing that now would risk breaking unity between Washington and Europe amid the Ukraine crisis.
But after weeks of talks, Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said this week he thought his fellow Democrats and Republicans had reached an impasse. 
Senator Jim Risch, the committee's top Republican, said he agreed with Menendez. ""It is at an impasse, but there are other ways forward,"" he told reporters at the Capitol.

One possibility is the introduction of a slimmed-down bill that would include less-controversial pieces of 
a Ukraine aide package, such as military assistance, leaving out more divisive matters.

BOSTON (Reuters) - US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Corp said on Friday it has split its chief executive officer and chairman roles after coming under pressure from an activist investment firm to improve its operations.
Pietro Satriano will remain the company's CEO and have a board seat, while Robert Dutkowsky, the board's lead independent director, has been elected non-executive chair.
Satriano was appointed board chairman in December 2017 after having joined it in July 2015 when he was named CEO of the company. Before that, he was the company's chief merchandising officer.
Dutkowsky has been a director since 2017.
US Foods, the largest U.S. food distributor after  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY), has faced labor shortages and supply chain issues since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company also has come under pressure from Sachem Head Capital Management LP, a New York-based firm run by hedge fund veteran Scott Ferguson and U.S. Foods' biggest investor with an 8.6% stake.
Sachem Head has argued US Foods' profitability could be improved with more focus on prices and higher-margin private label goods.
Corporations sometimes separate the key CEO and chairman roles when they are facing trouble and the move is considered a governance step that many pension funds and other large investors generally endorse.

US Foods also on Friday named two female board directors to head its compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees.
The company said ""it has implemented a series of changes consistent with its commitment to best practices of corporate governance.""

287,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 11:11AM ET</span>",Singapore Airshow returns under shadow of Asia's slow aviation recovery,"By Chen Lin and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Asia-Pacific aviation industry's slow recovery from the pandemic amid government restrictions will cast a shadow over the Singapore Airshow next week, despite signs of improvement as concerns over the Omicron variant recede.
The biennial event has bookended the pandemic, with the 2020 edition disrupted by the virus emerging from China and the latest show coming as the industry attempts to plot a way out of what became its biggest and most costly crisis.
International passenger travel in the region was down 93% from pre-pandemic levels last year, leaving airlines heavily reliant on freight for revenue, and the Chinese outbound tourism market remains closed. 
But there are signs of a rebound this year, Skyscanner booking data shows, as countries such as Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Australia reopen to more vaccinated tourists without quarantine.
The head of Finnair, which specialises in serving Asia from its Nordic hub, expressed optimism about a return towards normal business later this year.
Military demand is also picking up as regional economies recover from pandemic-induced slumps and countries look to bolster their capabilities, as highlighted by Indonesia's $8.1 billion order for 42 Rafale fighter jets on Thursday.
SMALLER SHOW
Planemakers Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) will send senior executives to the Singapore Airshow from Feb. 15-18, using it as an opportunity for now rare face-to-face meetings with customers.
But there will be around two-thirds fewer exhibitors than 2020 at Asia's biggest aerospace gathering, with the challenges of holding the show mirroring the travel difficulties that have pushed some of the region's airlines to the brink.
Some industry executives have pulled out, concerned about restrictions including daily testing, no intermingling during mealtime, mandatory masks in the tropical heat as well as hotel isolation if they test positive.
Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said he expected a quiet, locally oriented gathering with many of the overseas executives holding meetings in the city centre.
""The concern from many exhibitors is a lack of customers visiting,"" Sobie said. 
FEW ORDERS
The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 35% of the world's commercial aircraft fleet but only 4% of order announcements at air shows over the last decade were made in Singapore, according to broker Jefferies, partly because it is held at the start of the year when purchasing activity is usually thin.
During the pandemic, most Asian airlines have focused on deferring deliveries and handing back planes to lessors rather than placing fresh orders, though Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) in December signed a preliminary deal for seven Airbus A350 freighters.
That deal, which also involves reducing orders for passenger planes, could be firmed up next week along with announcements from both Airbus and Boeing for new services deals.
Boeing last month launched a freighter version of its 777X widebody that will compete against the A350 freighter. 
PR efforts at the show will focus on the benefits of new planes in cutting carbon emissions as the industry targets ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 through biofuels and engine technology. Environmentalists say the industry is not doing enough. 
U.S.-CHINA RIVALRY
The show - which typically features displays of military hardware and aerobatics - comes as Southeast Asia remains a key stage for a rivalry between the United States and China.
China's extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea, which it says are based on historic maps, have put it at odds with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, which have competing claims to islands and features.

Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said there was interest from military buyers in big-ticket purchases such as new-generation fighter jets, though pandemic-strained budgets remained tight.
""Drones, fixed- and rotary-winged transports, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, for example, would be more sought after given the utility of these assets for a whole range of peacetime purposes,"" he added.

Pretium recently bought more than 800 properties from Zillow for nearly $300 million and has signed a roughly $150 million agreement to acquire 400 more, according to the report.
The sale comes as Zillow shifts towards becoming a ""housing super app"", which will integrate the currently fragmented process of buying or selling a house.
Zillow did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Pretium declined to comment.

Shares of Zillow rose 12.6% to $53.89 in early trading, extending gains from the previous session when the company posted fourth-quarter revenue above market expectations on a strong performance in its home segment. 
In November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Zillow had reached a deal with Pretium to sell about 2,000 homes from its house-flipping business, which it decided to exit due to unpredictable prices.

The segment, which helps customers list their properties for sale, marked an 11-fold rise in revenue as Zillow managed to sell inventory faster and at better prices despite setbacks due to the Omicron coronavirus variant.
The results hint at a turn in Zillow's fortunes. The company's shares slumped nearly 50% in November, when unpredictable home prices forced Zillow to announce a surprise exit from its business of flipping houses.

HELSINKI (Reuters) -Finnair will remain a stand-alone airline and stick to its Asia-focused strategy while adding new routes to the United States, Chief Executive Topi Manner said on Friday.
Finland's national carrier has bet heavily on providing connections to Asia from its Helsinki hub so the recovery of Asian traffic from the slump caused by pandemic restrictions is particularly important.
Finnair expects the business environment to return to close to normal in the second half of this year following the pandemic disruptions.
""We are optimistic about summer,"" Manner told Reuters in an interview, adding the airline expected countries like Japan and South Korea to lift travel restrictions towards summer in the northern hemisphere.
""We believe Asia will open up eventually. In the meantime, we are partially pivoting to North America,"" Manner said.
Finnair's new summer destinations will include the U.S. cities of Dallas and Seattle, he added.
He was speaking after the airline announced a 200-million-euro ($228 million) investment in renewing the cabins of its long-haul fleet, including a new premium economy service and redesigned business cabin.
""This is a trend that has been accelerated by the pandemic. People are willing to upgrade the experience,"" he said.
Manner said the new cabin class was being added to address increasing demand in premium leisure travel, while also introducing a new business class seat called ""the air lounge"", a nest-like shell that offers more privacy. It does not recline but modifies to allow for horizontal sleeping. 
""We as a carrier of course need to differentiate and we have chosen to differentiate with quality,"" he said.
Finnair operates Airbus A330 and A350 planes on long-haul routes.
Unlike many airlines, Finnair has not yet joined a wave of orders for the latest generation of narrowbody jets like the A320neo, which burn 15% less fuel. 
Finnair's fleet of 35 Airbus A320-family jets includes some planes as old as 21 years but others produced as recently as 2018, according to its website. 

Asked whether Finnair planned to renew its medium-haul fleet, Manner said it could do so in three or four years but stressed the importance of sustainable aviation fuel as the airline targets net zero emissions by 2045.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Friday as the market recovered from the latest inflation shock.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 172 points, or 0.5% at 35,414 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
The publication of the highest annual rate of inflation in 40 years on Thursday was followed by a raft of forecast revisions from Wall Street banks to reflect an even faster tightening of monetary policy than previously foreseen. Short-term interest rate futures now attach an 80% likelihood of a 50 basis point hike in the Fed Funds target rate when the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meets in March, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts now predict seven quarter-point increases this year from the Fed. 
The market has been quick to internalize the new situation, suggesting that many participants feel either that an aggressive tightening is already priced in or, as seems increasingly likely, tighter monetary policy may tip the economy into recession, removing the need for rate hikes. 
However, there are still plenty of willing sellers into any strength. Gains were trimmed within the first half-hour of trading, with selling in long-duration tech names again prominent, pushing the Nasdaq slightly into negative territory. 
Bears were supported by fresh signs that the boom in consumer spending since the start of the pandemic is coming to an end. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for February fell to 61.7 from 67.2 a month earlier, defying hopes for a modest increase to 67.2. The survey showed a pronounced drop in assessments of current conditions, but five-year inflation expectations remained unchanged at 3.1%.
With the week's biggest earnings releases over, there were few big moves from any stocks large enough to affect broader sentiment.  Affirm Holdings  (NASDAQ:AFRM), the Buy-Now-Pay-Later fintech whose partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) raised such high hopes for the stock at the end of last year, fell 11% after it published a wider net loss caused largely by stock-based compensation. That leaves it testing a nine-month below, well below where it was before the Amazon announcement.
 Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) stock, by contrast, bounced from its recent lows after its quarterly report late on Thursday showed that the property market is still hot enough to wind down its ill-judged home-flipping business without too much financial pain. Zillow stock rose 10.8% but is still only worth a little more than a quarter of its peak a year ago.
There was also evidence of further exits from some of the market's most richly-valued large caps. Chipmaker stocks Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell over 2% each, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock dipped below $900 again, losing 1.4% at the end of a week punctuated by recall announcements.
There was better news from the travel sector, where  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock rose 1.9% after its numbers encouraged hopes that the disruptions from the pandemic are largely over.

Remdesivir, marketed as Veklury, was approved by the FDA in October 2020 to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Last month, this was expanded to non-hospitalized patients who were at high risk of severe disease.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Friday it is considering producing electric vehicles (EVs) in India for export, and possibly for sale in the domestic market, just months after the U.S. automaker decided to stop selling and manufacturing cars in the country. Ford's comments mark a shift in strategy after it said in September it was taking a hit of about $2 billion because it does not see a path to profitability and was leaving the major auto market. The decision came as a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign.
Ford has two car plants in the country. In a statement on Friday, the company said it was ""exploring the possibility of using a plant in India as an export base for EV manufacturing.""
When asked if the company may consider selling electric cars in India as well, a Ford India spokesman said, ""there have been no specific discussions on this right now, but it is not out of the realm of future consideration"".
Ford is increasingly targeting customers in what it said was a ""global electric vehicle revolution"". The automaker has previously said it plans to invest $30 billion in EVs and batteries through 2030.
Ford had less than 2% of the Indian passenger vehicle market when it stopped production in the country, having struggled for more than two decades to turn a profit. The restructuring was viewed positively by analysts.
The move allows Ford to keep a door open to re-enter India if it so decides at a later stage, said Gaurav Vangaal, Associate Director, Light Production Forecasting at IHS Markit. 
There is a cost benefit to manufacturing in India, and the company has historically exported vehicles to North America and Europe - both of which are now large and growing EV markets, said Vangaal.
""Ford will have to prove India can also be cost-competitive for making EVs, for which it will need big investments to localise the supply chain,"" he said, adding that it will also need to figure out how it would source lithium-ion batteries.

Ford's comments to explore India as an EV manufacturing hub came after the company's proposal to seek incentives under the government's $3.5 billion scheme for clean-fuel vehicles was approved on Friday.
The plan is a cornerstone of the Modi government's agenda to cut oil imports and reduce pollution by giving benefits of up to 18% of new investments made by companies to manufacture electric and hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles. Ford is among 20 other companies eligible for benefits under the scheme.

LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The incoming chairman of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) will review the position of CEO Jakob Stausholm to determine whether he is suitable to lead an overhaul of the company's toxic work culture, two people familiar with the matter said.
Dominic Barton, a former diplomat who takes up the role of chairman in May, could remove Stausholm if he decides Rio would be better served by a leader who was not in the upper echelons of the organisation in recent years, the sources told Reuters.
It was Stausholm who commissioned an external report, released by Rio on Jan. 31, that shone a light on a company culture rife with sexual harassment, racism and bullying over the past five years, including 21 allegations of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault. The report, which was based on the experiences and views of more than 10,000 employees, did not ascribe individual blame to any executive or worker.
Rio Tinto declined to comment further on the culture of bullying and on whether the board has confidence in Stausholm and the company's management. It referred queries back to a Reuters interview with Stausholm on Feb. 1, shortly after the report was released. Rio said Barton, who joins the board in April, was not available to comment.
    ""What we are saying today, very loud and clear, is what constitutes acceptable and not acceptable behaviour and we will not tolerate non-acceptable behaviour and we will deal with that,"" the CEO said at the time. 
""In a way that's kind of the easier part. The more difficult part is to address the root causes,"" said Stausholm, adding that he would push for change ""now I know what I know"". 
    Stausholm didn't respond to an emailed request for comment.
Rio Tinto won praise from many investors for publishing the damning 85-page report by former Australian sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, and pledging to implement all 26 recommendations, including creating an independent confidential unit to address reports of harmful behaviour.
The two sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Barton had not yet made a judgment on Stausholm's position. 
Barton will weigh whether the fact Stausholm has held senior management roles since 2018 - during some of the time covered by the report - made him unsuitable to lead a clean-up of the company's culture, according to the people. The CEO previously served as Rio Tinto's chief financial officer and executive director. 
""I don't think you can say the culture came from him (Stausholm) in any way, shape or form,"" said Ian Woodley, senior mining analyst at Old Mutual Investment Group, an investor in Rio Tinto. ""If anything I think it probably reflects quite well on him that they've been open and upfront about it.""
DESTRUCTION OF CAVES
Stausholm was vaulted into Rio's top job in 2021 after his predecessor Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies left the company in an executive cull prompted by another scandal: a public and political backlash over Rio Tinto's destruction of 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous rock shelters in Juukan Gorge, Australia, to expand an iron ore mine. Rio said last year that it would work with the leadership of local groups to agree an appropriate remedy for the destruction of the caves.
Rio's chairman of four years Simon Thompson subsequently said he would step down in April, bowing to investor pressure over the same issue, to be replaced by Barton. 
Stausholm's elevation to CEO came as a surprise to some investors and industry watchers who had expected the 149-year-old mining company to opt for an external hire to help to turn a fresh page. 
The two sources said Rio had struggled to attract suitable external candidates who could take the role at relatively short notice amid the Juukan Gorge furore.

Furthermore, Stausholm's initiation of the probe into the company's culture, coupled with possible board reluctance to have yet another leadership change - he is Rio's fourth CEO in nine years - may give him breathing room, the sources said.
""This culture that has been hidden is beginning to surface, and it's not pretty. (But) we are heartened by the fact that Rio has come out in the open, it has laid it bare. We are still to see what action Rio is going to take,"" said Glen Mpufane, director of mining at IndustriALL, a union federation that represents millions of industrial workers around the world.

BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW will pay 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to take majority control of its Chinese joint venture after securing the necessary licence from Beijing, as global automakers seek a tighter grip on business in the world's biggest car market. 
The German carmaker said on Friday it was increasing its stake in the venture with Brilliance Auto Group to 75% from 50%, as announced in 2018 when China said it would start relaxing ownership rules in the auto industry. 
China said at the time it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and for the wider car market by 2022.
BMW said the deal would have a one-off positive effect of 7-8 billion euros ($8-9 billion) on the financial results of its automotive business, and boost free cash flow by about 5 billion euros.
""Our extended joint venture contract lays the foundation for further mutual growth and progressive development ... It paves the way for balanced development in the three main regions of the world,"" Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said.
BMW was the first automaker to state in October 2018 it would take control of its main joint venture in China, which was founded in 2003 and is currently in place until 2040.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) took majority control of its electric vehicle production joint venture JAC Volkswagen in 2020.
Mercedes-Benz owns 49% of its joint venture in China, Beijing Benz Automotive. Reuters reported in 2019 it was seeking to raise its stake, but faced opposition from its Chinese partner BAIC.
BMW expects sales in China to grow into 2022, its CFO has said, after seeing 9% growth in BMW and Mini deliveries last year to 846,237 vehicles. The BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture produced 700,000 vehicles in 2021. 
Based in Shenyang, one plant in Dadong district is currently being expanded, while a new one that will build fully-electric models alongside hybrids and internal combustion engine cars is also under construction alongside an existing plant in Tiexi.

BMW will add production of its X5 model in China, previously imported from the United States, in the second quarter of the year at the BMW Brilliance joint venture, a U.S. supplier source told Reuters in December.

Germany has delayed approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline until at least the second half of 2022, but not cancelled the nearly completed project. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday the pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine.
Speaking in Warsaw, Habeck, of the ecologist Greens, said the approval process would be strictly in accordance with European law.
""And on the other hand, the geopolitical assessment will always have an influence on the approval of Nord Stream 2,"" he added.
On Monday, Scholz said the United States and Germany had the same approach to Ukraine, to Russia and to sanctions, but he did not mention the pipeline publicly by name over the course of his day-long visit on Washington.
Whether the United States and Germany are on the same page over the $11 billion pipeline project has become a crucial question as the two major democracies lead NATO allies in pushback against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Habeck described the Ukraine situation as ""extremely dicey"".

""Every diplomatic effort must be made to de-escalate this situation,"" Habeck told reporters, adding that Russia would face hard-hitting sanctions if diplomacy failed. 
""I say that knowing that every sanction of course has costs in one's own economy,"" he added.

Investing.com –  Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) stock (NYSE:UAA) plummeted 9% Friday after the company said it “expects material impacts for its spring-summer 2022 season” because of lingering supply chain challenges.
“There could be further material impacts on Under Armour's results in future periods,” it said while disclosing its fourth-quarter results.
The warning overshadowed the higher guidance that now pegs annual revenue gaining 25%, to $5.62 billion. Under Armour had earlier expected sales to grow in ""low-20s.""
The company brightened its outlook after revenue in the third quarter rose 8% to $1.5 billion and beat estimates. Consumer demand for the company's casual clothing stays sticky as people find them more comfortable while they carry out official and personal duties both. Its own and franchise stores did better as people returned to shop offline while the pandemic-fueled ecommerce sales declined.
Each of the categories -- apparel, footwear and accessories -- recorded double-digit growth. The biggest market, North America, grew the least, but still managed an 8% growth in quarterly revenue to $1 billion. All other geographies grew double digit.
Adjusted profit per share came in at 14 cents and beat estimates.
Under Armour said it will take a charge of $25 million to $75 million in the current quarter under its April 2020 restructuring plan. That exercise, aimed at improving the company’s profitability, has so far cost the company $500 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) is exploring the divestment of its U.S. variable annuity book as it seeks to free up resources to invest in higher-growth parts of its business, people familiar with the matter said.
The New York-based insurer is working with an investment bank on the plan, which is in its early stages, the sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain.
MetLife does not disclose the size of its variable annuity business. Its overall annuity book - including both fixed rate and variable policies - stood at $58.23 billion at the end of 2021, according to its financial statements.
Any sale would give MetLife only a fraction of whatever book value is divested in terms of proceeds. But the financial benefit of offloading the policies could still be substantial - potentially in the billions of dollars - because of the capital released, tax implications and other financial enhancements, the sources said.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. MetLife declined to comment.
U.S. insurers have in recent years been offloading closed books of annuity business, which require significant capital to be put aside and provide limited revenue growth as no new policies are being written.
Insurers have found willing buyers in private equity firms and their insurance arms, which can use the cash flow generated from the policies to invest in their suite of credit and other products.
MetLife's variable annuities book is housed within MetLife Holdings, a unit which holds product lines which the insurer no longer actively sells and just manages to maturity - known in the industry as runoff business.
MetLife Chief Financial Officer John McCallion told analysts this month that a rising interest rate environment could provide a catalyst for divesting parts of its runoff business. He did not say, however, that MetLife was exploring a sale of any part of MetLife Holdings. 
Most runoff dealmaking activity has so far been concentrated in life insurance and fixed rate annuities. Variable annuities have seen less interest, as there is a greater risk around generating sufficient investment return.

That is starting to change, however, as rising interest rates make it easier to turn a profit on such policies, because the yields which can be earned on investments are generally increasing. 
Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) said in September it had agreed to sell variable annuity policies worth $31 billion to Fortitude Re, which is backed by buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), for a total transaction value of $2.2 billion.

A fresh batch of global companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), oil giant BP (NYSE:BP) and Britain's GSK reported strong earnings, although Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms missed its profit forecasts. Investors bought U.S., European and Asian equity funds of $14.19 billion, $6.07 billion and $2.03 billion respectively. Financial sector funds obtained $1.63 billion in net buying, the biggest in three weeks, while energy and utilities sector funds received $0.76 billion each. 
However, consumer discretionary, health care and tech funds saw outflows of $0.8 billion, $0.73 billion and $152 million respectively.
Meanwhile, global bond funds posted outflows for a fifth straight week, worth $9.05 billion.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 07:50AM ET</span>",Telecom Italia board to discuss network spinoff in slow-burn KKR drama,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - The board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) will discuss the group's overhaul on Monday as newly appointed chief executive Pietro Labriola strives to forge an alternative to a takeover proposal by U.S. fund KKR.
The private equity group approached Italy's biggest telecom operator in late November but the process stalled while Telecom Italia changed its CEO, and Italy went through the process of reelecting its president.
Labriola, who previously ran TIM's Brazilian business, is now working on a standalone plan in response to the 10.8 billion euro ($12.30 billion) bid from KKR, which TIM's top shareholder, French media company Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), has said was too low.
Under pressure for years from competition at home and after a string of profit warnings last year, debt-laden TIM is considering splitting its network assets into a separate company as part of a broader revamp of its business.
That could pave the way to a long discussed merger of TIM's infrastructure assets with those of state-owned rival Open Fiber, a move advocated by state lender CDP, TIM's second largest investor.
Italy's main telecom unions called on Friday for a general strike on Feb. 23 and further action in protest against the possible spin off, raising concerns about its potential fallout on jobs. 
TIM's future is politically sensitive because the Italian government wants to use European Union funds to improve broadband access for millions of households and businesses as part of its post-pandemic recovery.
While it waits to see if KKR formalises its bid, Italy's Treasury would be prepared to allow the fund to play a role in the telecom's overhaul, two people close to the matter told Reuters. Last year, KKR already invested 1.8 billion euros in a 37.5% stake in TIM's secondary network.
MARCH MOVES
Under Labriola's plan, which the board is expected to approve on March 2, TIM would focus on its consumer business, while enhancing its offer for corporate clients and developing cloud, Internet of things and cybersecurity businesses. 
Sources have previously said it was unlikely TIM would take any firm stance on the KKR proposal before early March. 
Telecoms operators across Europe are looking at ways to reinvigorate their operations, with bankers reporting talks in multiple countries as companies gear up for the roll-out of expensive new 5G services.

Britain's Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) said on Thursday it had rejected a preliminary approach for its Italian business from France's Iliad and Apax Partners. That combination would have challenged TIM's position as Italy's largest mobile phone company.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 07:15AM ET</span>","Mercedes-Benz beats profit forecast, sees supply chain headwinds in 2022","By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans expects an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 14 billion euros ($15.9 billion) in 2021 and sees supply chain headwinds persisting into 2022, it said on Friday.
The luxury carmaker predicted an adjusted return on sales of 12.7% in the full year, beating its own guidance of 10%-12% as the jump in electric vehicle sales made up for supply chain troubles, it said as it released preliminary results.
But it expects high raw material prices and semiconductor shortages to prevent it meeting strong demand for its products this year, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told a call with analysts.
The chip shortage would ease in the second half of 2022, he said, adding that a ""good part"" of raw material costs were locked in but unit sales would still need to increase to mitigate the hit from rising costs.
""There will be a (raw) material headwind, so I think we will need the volume lever to mitigate and fight it,"" Wilhelm said. ""We will try and see what can still be done on top of 2021 in terms of the pricing but the pricing itself will not be enough.""
Its share price rose to 75.08 euros by 1145 GMT, up from 69.01 euros when markets opened.
Data released by Mercedes-Benz in January showed the carmaker registered a 5% sales drop in 2021, losing its crown for the first time in five years to BMW as the premium carmaker with the most vehicles sold.
Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius has repeatedly said the aim was to boost profitability rather than focus exclusively on unit sales in its bid to raise the firm's stock market valuation after splitting from Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck in December.
""Our good results are the outcome of highly sought-after products and the focus on profitable growth and cost discipline,"" Kaellenius said in a statement.
The fourth quarter saw an adjusted return on sales of 15%, the company said on Friday, with profitability boosted by ""solid net pricing, good product mix and favourable used car performance.""
Mercedes-Benz expects the deconsolidation from Daimler Truck to boost its EBIT by 9 to 10 billion euros.

Mercedes-Benz is due to report full-year results on Feb. 24.

Investing.com – Zillow Group stock (NASDAQ:ZG) surged 14% in premarket trading Friday after the company beat estimates for the fourth quarter and made speedier progress on winding down its home-flipping business.
A hot property market drove quarterly revenue up nearly five-fold to $3.9 billion. That robustness in business also helped the company sell its inventory quicker and at higher prices, translating into lower writedowns as it exits the Zillow Offers business -- $405 million against the $565 million expected when it took the decision in November.
Zillow Offers is a service to homeowners to sell without having to coordinate repairs or host open houses. After buying, Zillow prepares it for sale by doing the same type of projects a typical seller would, then lists it on the open market.
Zillow Offers suffered as the company tweaked its algorithms to grab higher share in a sellers’ market, overpaying for houses just when the prices were beginning to cool off. Left with a large inventory, it decided to exit the business to focus on the core platform. A consequence of that decision was a loss of a fourth of the employees, a process still underway.
Co-founder and CEO Rich Barton said the company is now focused on building a ‘housing super app’ to connect all the stakeholders in a market that’s still fragmented. Traffic growth at the company’s online platforms was flat at 198 million average monthly unique users in the December quarter.
Zillow is now targeting $5 billion in annual revenue and a 45% EBITDA margin by 2025. Adjusted loss per share was 41 cents and narrower than expected.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>",White House tells chip industry to brace for Russian supply disruptions,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is warning the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, people familiar with the matter said.
The potential for retaliation has garnered more attention in recent days after Techcet, a market research group, published a report on Feb. 1 highlighting the reliance of many semiconductor manufacturers on Russian and Ukrainian-sourced materials like neon, palladium and others.
According to Techcet estimates, over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of U.S. palladium is sourced from Russia.
Peter Harrell, who sits of the White House's National Security Council, and his staff have been in touch with members of the chip industry in recent days, learning about their exposure to Russian and Ukrainian chipmaking materials and urging them to find alternative sources, the people said.
The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the conversations, but a senior official reiterated that the administration was prepared if Russia invaded Ukraine. 
""Part of that is working with companies to make sure that if Russia takes actions that interfere with supply chains, companies are prepared for disruptions,"" the person said. 
""We understand that other sources of key products are available and stand ready to work with our companies to help them identify and diversify their supplies."" 
Joe Pasetti, vice president of global public policy at the chip and electronics manufacturing suppliers group SEMI, sent an email to members this week gauging exposure to the vital chipmaking supplies, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.
""As discussed on today's call, please see the attached document ... regarding Russian/Ukrainian production of a number of semiconductor materials,"" he wrote, referencing a summary by Techcet on C4F6, Palladium, Helium, Neon and Scandium from the troubled region. ""Please let me know if potential supply disruptions to any of them are a concern for your company."" 
Neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, is a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to Techcet. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory, among other applications.
The Biden administration has threatened to impose sweeping export controls against Russia if it invades Ukraine. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, denies it plans to attack.
Some chipmakers have been reviewing their supply chains to scan for potential fallout from conflict in Ukraine. One person at a chipmaking company who declined to be named acknowledged that it has been looking into its supply of neon and other gases, some of which originate in Ukraine.
""Even if there was a conflict in Ukraine it wouldn't cut off supply. It would drive prices up,"" the person said. ""The market would constrict. Those gases would become pretty scarce. But it wouldn’t stop semiconductor manufacturing,"" he added.
According to one power chip design startup executive, unrest in Ukraine has caused rare gas prices to increase and could cause supply issues. Fluorine is another gas that has a large supply from that part of the world and could be affected, the executive added. 
William Moss, a spokesperson for  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), said the chipmaker was not anticipating any impact to neon supply.

But the issue is still concerning, because global chip supplies are tight and chip orders are only expected to pick up. Techcet estimates demand for all the materials will rise by more than 37% over the next 4 years, pointing to recent announcements by Intel, Samsung (KS:005930), and Taiwan's TSMC in Ohio, Arizona and Texas.
Neon prices rose 600% in the runup to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, since chip firms relied on a few Ukrainian companies, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, continuing the previous session’s sharp selloff after a blistering inflation report lifted expectations of an aggressive response from the Federal Reserve, prompting investors to desert riskier assets.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 140 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 22 points, or 0.5%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 85 points, or 0.6%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 500 points, or 1.5%, lower on Thursday, its worst daily performance since Jan. 18, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.1%, suffering the most.
Data released Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices posting the highest annual increase in 40 years, prompting St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard to call for a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2% for the first time since 2019, and influential investment bank Goldman Sachs is now looking for seven 25 basis point interest rate rises from the Fed this year, up from its previous forecast of five.
The main economic data Friday is the Michigan consumer sentiment survey for February, which is expected to marginally improve to 67.5 from 67.2 in January. The survey’s 5-year inflation expectations figure will also be studied closely to see how quickly inflation - or not - inflation risks becoming entrenched. 
In corporate news,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock rose over 4% premarket after the online travel agency recorded a profit in the fourth quarter, stating that the impact of the recent wave of the Covid-19 virus was less severe and of shorter duration than previous ones.
 Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) stock soared 14% after the real estate company reported another quarterly revenue beat as the housing market remained red-hot, while fintech firm Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) stock slumped 10% in response to weak guidance.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, helped by the International Energy Agency raising its 2022 world demand forecast by 870,000 barrels a day, adding that the OPEC+ coalition’s “chronic” struggle to revive production could push prices higher still.  
That said, the crude market is still heading for the first weekly decline since mid-December as the red-hot U.S inflation release pointed to aggressive interest rate hikes, boosting the dollar and slowing demand.
In addition, the Iranian nuclear talks appear to be progressing, which could result in the return of crude exports to the global market from the Persian Gulf nation.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $91.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $92.45. Both contracts had posted new seven-year highs this week, but are still in line for their first weekly decline after seven consecutive weekly gains.  
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,827.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1404.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Suzuki Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor are among 20 companies that will be eligible for incentives under India's $3.5 billion scheme to boost clean fuel vehicles, the government said on Friday.
The federal cabinet last year approved a plan under which it will give benefits to the automobile sector over a five-year period to boost production of electric and hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles and their components. 
The scheme is also part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government plan to cut the fuel import bill and bring down pollution by encouraging local production of clean vehicles. 
The ministry of heavy industries said it has approved applications from 20 companies which also include Kia Motors,  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), Mahindra & Mahindra and Softbank-Group Ola Electric.
Ford last year decided to stop selling cars in India but has still retained its two factories in the country. The automaker is exploring the possibility of using one of its plants in India as a base to produce electric cars for export.
Tata Motors said it is committed ""to shape India's vehicular landscape with smart and sustainable mobility solutions"".
Suzuki, Hyundai, Kia, Mahindra and Ola did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A total of 115 automakers and auto part makers applied for the incentives scheme. The government will announce the final list of auto component makers at a later date. 
The incentives will range from 8% to 18% of the sales value of the vehicles or components, and will be given to companies if they meet certain conditions such as a minimum investment over five years and 10% growth in sales each year, Reuters has previously reported.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and U.S. carmaker Rivian have backed a moratorium on deep-sea mining and will exclude seabed metals from their supply chains in a blow to an industry that aims to capitalise on demand from electric vehicle and other industries.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said deep seabed exploration was a priority as a way to gain access to ""rare metals"" and to better understand marine ecosystems.
The decision by Renault, in which the French government holds 15.01%, adds pressure on the nascent deep-sea mining industry which aims to extract battery metals like cobalt, nickel and manganese from potato-sized nodules.
No mining of the seabed is allowed until global regulations are finalised by the U.N. International Seabed Authority.
U.S. electric carmaker Rivian joined http://www.savethehighseas.org/2022/02/09/rivian-pledges-to-keep-the-deep-sea-out-of-vehicles the call for a moratorium. ""Rivian shares the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition's goal of protecting our oceans,"" it told Reuters in an email.
Companies that hold exploration licences on the seabed, including The Metals Company, GSR and UK Seabed Resources - a subsidiary of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s UK-based arm - hope to eventually sell seabed metals to carmakers.
A Renault spokesperson said the firm's call for a moratorium was in line with the government's position because France ""plans to invest in seabed exploration in order to identify potential solutions for sustainable extraction"".
Macron stopped short of backing seabed mining, which critics say could wipe out as-yet-undiscovered species.
""I can already hear the debate coming, I am not talking about exploitation for the moment, I am talking about exploration,"" he said in a speech in October.
France holds an exploration contract through the Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), valid until June 2026, for a 75,000 square-kilometre area in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the North Pacific rich in polymetallic nodules.
SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
""What we are trying to push is work that will enable us to understand what would happen if mining took place,"" said Jean-Marc Daniel, IFREMER's head of physical resources and deep-sea ecosystems, adding that his organisation would not promote deep-sea mining until it had ""guarantees"" about its impact.
The French government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Renault's logo appeared on a deep-sea mining campaign website https://www.noseabedmining.org listing the companies that have backed the moratorium, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930) SDI and BMW Group. 
A Renault spokesperson said the logo was added on Tuesday as part of the carmaker's sustainability strategy.
Companies backing the moratorium commit to excluding such metals from their supply chains and not financing deep-sea mining. The moratorium calls for a clear demonstration that deep-sea mining will protect marine habitats before work starts.
""Governments should listen to these companies and agree on a moratorium to allow for independent science and invest in circular economy solutions to take the pressure off our ocean,"" Jessica Battle, lead at WWF's No Deep Seabed Mining initiative, said. 

The ISA is drawing up regulations governing seabed mining in the high seas, areas outside any national jurisdiction.
Talks were disrupted by the global pandemic but in-person meetings of the ISA Council and ISA Assembly took place in December. The ISA Council, the executive organ of the ISA, will next meet from March 21 to April 1.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc's star trainers are proving to be just as valuable as its stationary bikes to help the company survive after the pandemic.
Peloton's sales flourished as people snapped up the company's in-home fitness equipment when COVID-19 forced businesses and offices to close. Its fortunes faded as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products. A subsequent 84% drop in the company's shares in the past year has attracted interest from potential buyers including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), according to media reports.
Peloton makes stationary bikes and treadmills through which people can subscribe, on a monthly basis, to participate remotely in the company's library of live and pre-recorded exercise classes.
To combat sagging sales, the New York-based company on Tuesday announced a restructuring and named a new chief executive, Barry McCarthy. Peloton is cutting 20% of its corporate staff while sparing those who lead the company's online fitness classes - and who are critical to keeping its 6 million customers peddling and paying.
Peloton's talent work on fixed, multi-year contracts and can leave the company before their agreements expire, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
Cody Rigsby and Robin Arzon, who teach cycling, have become household names, with about 1 million Instagram followers each and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fan pages that draw in tens of thousands of Peloton members.
""The instructors have become incredibly important brands,"" said Tim Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University's Kellogg (NYSE:K) School of Management. ""If a member sees their three favorite instructors leave the platform, that connection is reduced and the whole proposition is significantly diminished.""
As of this month, Peloton's 12-month retention rate for subscribers to their platform of classes is 92%, it said.
A Peloton spokesperson told Reuters that the company’s roster of instructors is foundational to the user experience, adding that Peloton will continue to invest in its content and programming.
Peloton charges $39 per month for an all-access membership, which requires subscribers to also purchase a bike for at least $1,500 or a treadmill for $2,500.
SUPER FAN 
Amanda Segal, a Peloton member based in Maryland, was slow to get hooked on Peloton when she bought a bike in 2018. But Segal's connections with Peloton instructors - especially London-based cycling instructor Leanne Hainsby - ultimately turned her into a super-fan.
Segal now runs the 6,500-member Hainsby Facebook fan page, called Leanne Hainsby's Yes To You Crew. She also hosts a podcast about the Peloton community. 
""For me, it's 95% the instructors,"" she said, adding that most of the 2,000 rides she has done have been with Hainsby.
About 50 Hainsby groupies, introduced through the Hainsby Facebook fan page, traveled to London in November to meet one another. Some fans stood outside the London Peloton studio to meet Hainsby and cycling and strength instructor Ben Alldis, said Peloton member Doug Ransom. Ransom is also an administrator of the Hainsby Facebook group and traveled from Texas to attend the London gathering.
""If Leanne went to NordicTrack tomorrow, I would probably buy a NordicTrack bike,"" Ransom said of his loyalty to Hainsby.
Peloton member Alon Nager of Maryland recognized the value of instructor personalities when he joined the platform back in 2018 and became enthralled by former instructor Jennifer Jacobs. When Jacobs left the company in 2019 to work on her personal brand, Nager said his Peloton experience changed for the worse.
That was until he attended instructor Kendall Toole's debut cycling ride in June 2019.
""There was something about her that was just magical. It brought all the feelings back that I had previously with the other instructor,"" Nager said.

Instructors play an instrumental role in the company's brand loyalty, said Daniel McCarthy, assistant professor of marketing at Emory University's Goizueta Business School.
""She could be a friend. She could be a sister,"" said Peloton member Enisha Blakely in reference to cycling instructor Tunde Oyeneyin. ""It made it that much more personable for me.""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Affirm Holdings  stock (NASDAQ:AFRM) looks set to extend its losses of the previous session as its widening losses lend more weight to worries about the profitability horizon of ‘buy now, pay later’ platforms.
The stock traded 9% lower in premarket trading after losing more than a fifth of its value Thursday due to losses that were worse than expected.
Net loss in the second quarter rose six-fold to $160 million, owing to stock-based compensation to staff and an accounting entry to recognize a liability. The adjusted loss per share was 57 cents.
Gross merchandise value, a metric defining the value of all transactions done on an online platform, more than doubled to $4.5 billion in the second quarter. Active customers more than doubled and merchants also signed up at an unprecedented pace.
Transactions per customer rose but provisions for credit losses rose from the previous quarter. The results come at a time when rising interest rates are set to dampen consumer spending growth and raise the cost of capital for young and still unprofitable companies like Affirm.
Most fintech BNPLs don't charge interest, making their money on the difference between what they pay the merchant and what they recoup from the buyer.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Google on Friday was targeted in an antitrust complaint by the European Publishers Council over its digital advertising business, potentially strengthening EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's investigation into the issue.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google made $147 billion in revenue from online ads in 2020, more than any other company in the world, with ads including search, YouTube and Gmail accounting for the bulk of its overall sales and profits.
About 16% of its revenue came from the company's display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.
The European Commission opened an investigation in June into whether Google favours its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of rivals, advertisers and online publishers.
The publishers' trade body, whose members include Axel Springer, News UK, Conde Nast, Bonnier News and Editorial Prensa Iberica, took its grievance to the European Commission, alleging Google has an adtech stranglehold over press publishers.
""It is high time for the European Commission to impose measures on Google that actually change, not just challenge, its behaviour,"" EPC Chairman Christian Van Thillo said in a statement.
""Google has achieved end-to-end control of the ad tech value chain, boasting market shares as high as 90-100% in segments of the ad tech chain,"" he said.
Vestager, who has fined Google more than 8 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in recent years for anti-competitive practices in three cases, last year launched the investigation into Google's digital advertising business.
Google said publishers benefit from its adtech services.

""When publishers choose to use our advertising services, they keep the majority of revenue and every year we pay out billions of dollars directly to the publishing partners in our ad network,"" a Google spokesperson said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Volvo Cars on Friday posted earnings below expectations pressured by global supply shortages despite strong demand for its vehicles.
Profits at the carmaker, which listed on Nasdaq Stockholm in October, were also dented by raw material costs and accounting changes at electric vehicle (EV) venture Polestar, in which it owns a 49% stake. 
The Gothenburg-based company and global peers have been forced to cut vehicle output, despite robust demand in key markets such as China and the United States, due to a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Volvo said the supply chain would remain a restraining factor, while the component shortage would only gradually improve. 
""It will definitely continue in the first half of the year. I think it's too early to say we will see a normalisation in the second half too,"" long-time CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who is due to step down in March, told Reuters.
While some automakers have said chip shortages could ease in the second half of 2022, some chipmakers have warned that a recovery could take longer.
Volvo's fourth-quarter operating profit fell to 3.7 billion Swedish crowns ($396.4 million) from 4.9 billion a year earlier and missed the 4.8 billion expected by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.
Quarterly revenue fell 6% to 80.1 billion crowns but topped the 75.2 billion expected by analysts. Volvo said it expected continued sales growth in 2022.
Volvo shares, down by 5% so far this year but up 39% from their IPO price through Thursday, fell 4.8% by 0940 GMT.
JP Morgan said it expected earnings downgrades ""driven by the discussion on expenses incurred at Polestar"".
Volvo aims for 50% of its sales to be pure electric cars by the middle of this decade. In January, the proportion was 6.6%.
The company's full-year operating margin rose to 7.2% from 3.2% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2019 before the pandemic struck.

Volvo, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, proposed to pay no dividend.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 05:20AM ET</span>",China property developers shares up on reports they may have more access to funds,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares of Chinese property developers climbed on Friday, following media reports that the sector is gaining easier access to presale proceeds from residential projects - the latest move by authorities to ease the industry's severe cash crunch.
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into a liquidity crisis, highlighted by Evergrande, the world's most indebted property firm. The contagion has engulfed other developers and contributed to a sharp slump in China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of its economy.
Cailianshe, an online provider of financial news, said late on Thursday that authorities have issued new rules to correct any ""over-tightening"" of developers' escrow accounts that had happened at the city or county-level.
Developers now only need to keep funds in the escrow accounts determined by construction contract costs, the report said, allowing more flexibility for developers to withdraw funds.
The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index closed up 2.2%, versus a flat main Hang Seng Index.
Notable gainers included China Vanke, which jumped 4.9%, and Guangzhou R&F Properties, which surged 7.3%.
Chinese developers are allowed to sell residential projects before completing them, but are required to put those funds in escrow accounts. They can withdraw fund in stages depending on how much they have completed the project.
Cash held in escrow typically accounts for 50% of developers' pre-sale funds, developers and analysts said.
Reuters reported last month that China was drafting nationwide rules to make it easier for property developers to access pre-sale funds held in escrow accounts.
The 21st Century Business Herald newspaper said the new national rules aim to standardize regulations on the escrow accounts as some cities had previously tightened to hold up all the funds of developers.
It said the new rules will also enhance local oversight by asking banks to monitor and reconcile escrow accounts with housing authorities.
Citi said in a report that an easing in escrow restrictions would be a much-needed policy to ""heal the pain"" and ""comfort the spirit"", and it would benefit liquidity of the firms.
The investment bank said there were also other positive signs in the sector including state-owned firms buying assets from distressed developers, and their creditors extending debt.
But it cautioned that improvement in the fundamentals is yet to be seen, as it expected a 30% drop in property sales in the first quarter and a 20% decrease in 2021 earnings.
The sector has $39 billion of offshore public bonds and 163.7 billion yuan ($25.76 billion) of onshore bonds maturing in 2022, according to Fitch.

Developers' fundraisings in January dropped 70% from a year ago to 79 billion yuan, property researcher CREIS said, while another researcher CRIC said January home sales dropped 40%.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – ADRs of  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) traded 0.4% higher Friday as sales of e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and nicotine grew in 2021, underpinning the company’s focus on growing new categories of business.
Compounding the gains in the stock was a new 2-billion-pound ($2.72 billion) share repurchase program and a 1% rise in the dividend to 218 pence.
Revenue from new categories climbed 51% to 2.05 billion pounds. For the first time, the segment reported a narrower loss, reducing the drag on group earnings growth. BAT said the unit is on track to break even and deliver revenue of 5 billion pounds by 2025.
The company was able to take its non-combustible products such as Vuse e-cigarettes, glo heated tobacco and Velo oral nicotine to 4.8 million more consumers in 2021, capping a year in which pressure from funds, activists and ESG-focused organizations only increased. Over 18 million people now use those products and BAT aims to accelerate the shift to them by increasing investment in the space. 
Total revenue in the year rose 7% to near 26 billion pounds.
BAT (LON:BATS) expects revenue growth of 3%-5% this year, and around 9% growth in adjusted EPS. That's despite the long-term structural demand decline for tobacco globally.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Expedia  stock (NASDAQ:EXPE) traded 3.7% higher in premarket Friday after its combined package of hotel and flight bookings brought it back to profits in the fourth quarter, overcoming a resurgent virus.
Adjusted profit was $167 million against a loss of $376 million in the same period last year, as people took their chances and travelled. Gross booking jumped 131% to go well past $17 billion, against the backdrop of improving business sentiment and the easing of restrictions around much of the country. 
Lodging, which contributes three-fourths to the company’s revenue, grew the strongest as people stayed at the properties longer, a trend also being seen at Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) which suggests that the shift to remote work reduces people's dependence on fixed locations. Expedia guests also paid more for every night on an average basis. Lodging revenue was up 116% at $1.7 billion.
Total revenue climbed 148% to $2.28 billion, also boosted by strong growth in airline bookings and advertising at Trivago and Expedia Group Media Solutions. More air tickets were booked as economies reopened and business travel staged a recovery - albeit one that appears to have encountered fresh headwinds again since January.
Adding to the company’s topline was an unexpected boost under ‘other revenue’ from both car and travel insurance products. That item booked $349 million in revenue in the fourth quarter compared to a negligible $6 million in the same period last year.
Adjusted profit per share was $1.06 and easily beat estimates.

The brokerage, which cut its rating on global equities for the first time since the peak of the pandemic, said the Fed rates need to be at 1.7% for 2022, in line with market estimates. By the end of 2023 it sees the need for the rates to be at 2.5%, which is above market expectations.
""The Fed has met its twin targets of maximum employment and 2% average core PCE, hence policy should be neutral,"" Credit Suisse Analyst Andrew Garthwaite said.
He also expects the output gap to have fully closed by the end of 2022, and hence monetary conditions should be ""at least neutral"".
Garthwaite also argued that the most critical issue for global markets is U.S. wage growth, which is ""too high"", being 75 basis points above levels that would be consistent with the Fed's inflation target.

""The reliable lead indicators of U.S. wage growth are not yet falling. If wages were to stay at current levels until May, the Fed would have to quickly slow GDP growth to below trend at whatever rates that are required,"" CS said.
On Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said that he has become ""dramatically"" more hawkish in light of the hottest inflation in nearly 40 years, and he now wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes by July 1.

Malaysian makers of items from medical gloves to palm oil have increasingly drawn scrutiny over accusations that they abuse foreign workers, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.
VS Industry, a provider of electronics manufacturing services, said the third-party review would be based on 11 indicators of forced labour set out by the International Labour Organization (ILO).
""The scope of PwC Consulting's appointment also extends to providing a workshop to (the) board and management to increase knowledge and awareness of forced labour issues and risk management,"" it said in a stock exchange filing.
PwC Consulting declined to comment.
In December, Malaysia charged the firm's rival, ATA IMS, which supplies British high-end home appliance maker Dyson, with four violations of labour law on workers' accommodation.
ATA had asked for the charges to be dropped, saying any infractions were caused by ""challenges presented during the pandemic"".
Dyson had terminated contracts with ATA after an independent audit of its labour practices and accusations by a whistleblower.
ATA has acknowledged some violations https://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-labour-dyson-ata-ims-idUSL4N2SS2PM, made some improvements https://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-labour-dyson-ata-ims-idUSL4N2SS2PM and said it now complies with all regulations and standards.
VS Industry said the review aims to identify, understand and close the gaps specifically for labour practices under a government-initiated worker recalibration programme, and would be supported by an independent labour rights consultant.

An aggressive 50 basis point U.S. interest rate hike to contain inflation now appears like a no-brainer after the hottest inflation reading in nearly 40 years.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday's data, with its 7.5% headline inflation print, made him ""dramatically"" more hawkish. He now wants a full percentage point of rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings.
Money markets didn't waste any time -- they price in a more than an 80% chance of a large half-point rate hike when the Federal Reserve meets in March.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is above 2%, and one-year bond yields are up 27 basis points this week, set for their biggest rise since 2008.
Stock markets, which just days ago appeared okay with the idea that rates are heading higher, are starting to feel jittery at the thought of aggressive rate hikes coming fast.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1%. European stock futures are down 1%, U.S. futures too are falling -- not a good sign for Wall Street.
Some central bankers are trying to push back against the market narrative on the rate outlook.
Raising the European Central Bank's main rate now would not bring down record-high euro zone inflation and hurt the economy, ECB President Christine Lagarde said in an interview.
Tensions over Ukraine meanwhile give investors another reason to stay away from risk assets for now.
Britain said on Thursday the ""most dangerous moment"" in the West's standoff with Moscow appeared imminent, as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine.
Russia's central bank is expected to raise its key rate by 100 basis points later in the day.

Capital A Chief Executive Tony Fernandes told reporters in a virtual briefing that all companies under the group, including the airline, would be managed independently, and that the parent group intends for the airline to list.
""I think that's up to the board at the right time when they think they need to list and raise capital independently, but definitely from Capital A's board, that is very much a plan,"" he said.

Fernandes said the group aims to get all its 200 planes flying in six months, expecting a full recovery of the business in the fourth quarter even if China, which contributes high tourist numbers, does not reopen borders fully.
""We are anticipating China not to be fully open, but we can cover that with other territories,"" Fernandes said, pointing to the growing number of travellers domestically and within Southeast Asia.
AirAsia is flying 45% of its fleet, and aims to grow its Indonesian fleet from seven to 30 by year-end.
Capital A has also launched an aviation consulting business to help set up non-AirAsia branded low-cost airlines outside the ASEAN region for other owners. It is already working on two projects.
Last month, the group was tagged as a financially distressed company by the national stock exchange. Firms with that tag may be de-listed if they fail to regularize their finances within a set time frame.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday as the sharp rise in U.S. consumer prices raised the prospect of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, potentially weighing on global growth.
By 4:15 AM ET (09415 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 1.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.8%.
The weakness in Europe, which follows a sharp selloff on Wall Street and losses in Asia overnight, follows the release of U.S. data on Thursday which showed consumer prices surged 7.5% in January on a year-over-year basis, the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years.
The market now sees a strong chance of the Federal Reserve starting its monetary policy tightening with a 50 basis point hike in March, especially after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard stated that he has become ""dramatically"" more hawkish. He added that he now wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings.
The U.S. economy is the world’s largest and is traditionally the globe’s major growth driver. Any moves to curtail demand there are likely to have wider implications.
That said, European stock markets have been buttressed to a certain extent by ECB President Christine Lagarde’s warning on Thursday that tightening monetary policy too quickly could harm the Eurozone’s economic recovery.
Additionally, there was some relatively positive economic data as the U.K. economy expanded by 7.5% last year, the strongest annual growth since 1941, with a milder-than-expected 0.2% hit in December.
In corporate news, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) stock rose 0.3% after the world’s second-largest tobacco company reported a 7% rise in fourth-quarter revenue as well as a dividend increase and a 2 billion pound ($2.7 billion) share repurchase program for 2022.
Mercedes Benz (DE:DAIGn) stock rose 1.6% after the German car maker, which spun off its commercial vehicle business  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck (DE:DTGGe) in December, expects a return on sales of 12.7% in the full year.  
Oil prices edged higher Friday, but are still heading for their first weekly decline since mid-December as the red-hot U.S inflation release pointed to aggressive interest rate hikes, boosting the dollar.
In addition, the Iranian nuclear talks appear to be progressing, which could result in the return of crude exports to the global market from the Persian Gulf nation.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $90.09 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $91.45. Both contracts had posted new seven-year highs this week, but are still in line for their first weekly decline after seven consecutive weekly gains.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia on Friday withdrew a cartel lawsuit against  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and four former executives over a $1.8 billion share issue, a stunning retreat from what would have been the country's biggest white-collar criminal trial.
After nearly four years of pre-trial hearings in packed courtrooms, federal prosecutors said they had pulled the case after reviewing the evidence and concluding ""there were no longer reasonable prospects of conviction"".
The scope of the lawsuit had narrowed in recent months with prosecutors already having dropped charges against the former head of Citi in Australia, the client for the stock issue in question, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, and ANZ's former treasurer.
The move ends a potentially far-reaching challenge to the way investment banks jointly underwrite capital raisings and removes the threat of jail for the former bank executives. It also raises anew questions of whether Australian authorities had overstepped.
The banks had been charged with ""cartel conduct"" that carried the potential for steep fines and prison terms of up to 10 years. The matter came at the height of the Australian public's backlash against what was seen as an unscrupulous banking sector.

At the heart of the case were conference calls soon after the 2015 stock issue in which the banks discussed that they were left holding unissued shares. Their staff were heard saying they would withhold selling the shares to prevent a flood of new stock hitting the market which would have sent the price down.
""We have always maintained that our bank and our staff ... acted responsibly, in the interests of clients and in a manner consistent with all rules and regulations,"" Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) said in a statement. 
Michael Richardson, Deutsche's Australia head of equity capital markets from 2008 to 2017 and one of the individual defendants in the case, said he welcomed the decision but added: ""I will never get back the last four years of my life.""
""It has had an enormous impact on me, my business career and my family and I struggle to understand why I have been put through this ordeal,"" he said in a statement. ""I am looking forward to throwing myself fully back into my business career without the distraction and disruption of this matter.""
Citi said it had ""steadfastly denied the allegations and is looking forward to putting this matter behind us"".
ANZ declined to comment on the decision. When it was removed from the case in October, it said it had always acted lawfully.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) was also on the conference calls. On legal advice, it notified regulators about a potential perception of collusion in exchange for immunity from prosecution, its former staff said in hearings, adding that they never viewed the discussions as improper.
Representatives for JPMorgan were not immediately available for comment.
The decision is an embarrassing setback for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) which first referred the matter to prosecutors.
The antitrust regulator would have had a stronger impact if it had demanded public undertakings from the banks about measures to prevent price-fixing and provided new guidelines for share underwriting, said Rob Nicholls, an associate professor in regulation and governance at the University of New South Wales who has worked at the ACCC.

""Perhaps it was a stretch at the beginning but it looks like even more of a fall at the end. The outcome of this process is: 'oh well, they couldn't get the prosecution up, so why on earth would we change what we've been doing before?'"" he said.
ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement that he respected the prosecutors' decision and ""with them will consider what lessons can be learnt from this matter"".

331,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 01:21AM ET</span>",Sarah Palin felt 'powerless' vs 'Goliath' NY Times - testimony,"By Jody Godoy and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin said at her defamation trial against the New York Times on Thursday she felt ""powerless"" after a 2017 editorial incorrectly linked the prominent Republican to a mass shooting six years earlier, accusing the newspaper of trying to ""score political points.""
Before both sides rested their cases, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate told jurors in Manhattan federal court that she was ""mortified"" after the editorial appeared to connect her to inciting murder.
""It's hard to lay your head on a pillow and have a restful night when you know that lies are told about you, a specific lie that was not going to be fixed,"" Palin testified under questioning from her lawyer. ""That causes some stress anyone would feel.""
Palin, 57, said the Times was ""trying to score political points,"" calling the newspaper ""the be-all, end-all, the loud voice in American media."" Palin likened the newspaper to the biblical giant Goliath, and herself to the underdog David.
""It was devastating to read, again, an accusation, a false accusation that I had anything to do with murder, murdering innocent people,"" Palin said. ""And I felt powerless.""
Under cross-examination by Times lawyer David Axelrod, however, Palin struggled to provide specific examples about how the editorial harmed her reputation, while saying that ""things changed"" and many people thought less of her.
Palin testified for about 3-1/2 hours over two days, following testimony by James Bennet, a former Times editorial page editor and also a defendant in her lawsuit.
Bennet said he never intended to blame Palin or her political action committee in the disputed editorial headlined ""America's Lethal Politics,"" which addressed gun control and the growth of incendiary political rhetoric.
After six days of testimony, closing arguments are scheduled for Friday. Jurors may begin deliberating Friday afternoon or on Monday.
CROSS HAIRS
The June 14, 2017, editorial was written after a shooting that day at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia where Republican U.S. congressman Steve Scalise was wounded.
It referred to the January 2011 shooting in an Arizona parking lot by gunman Jared Lee Loughner where six people were killed and then-Democratic U.S. congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was seriously wounded.
Bennet added language drawing a link between the Giffords shooting and a map circulated by Palin's political action committee that the editorial said put 20 Democrats including Giffords under cross hairs.
He told jurors he had been under deadline pressure when he added the phrase ""the link to political incitement was clear"" to the editorial.
There is no evidence Loughner had a political motive, and the Times corrected the editorial the next day.
Palin said she believed the correction was accurate but did not ""fully correct"" the record, noting that it did not name her.
She faces a high legal bar to win in a trial that tests longstanding legal protections for U.S. media against defamation claims by public figures.
Palin must convince jurors there was clear and convincing evidence that the Times and Bennet acted with ""actual malice,"" https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-times-palin-idUKKBN25O31B meaning they knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
While Palin can seek damages for harm to her reputation, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said outside the jury's presence that he would not let jurors award punitive damages. He said evidence Bennet had ill will toward Palin was ""quite modest.""
'POWER OF THE PEN'
During cross-examination, Palin agreed that the symbols on the map looked like cross hairs, but also resembled surveyor markings.
Asked if she endorsed the map, she said, ""It has my name on it, so yes.""
While accusing media of abusing the ""power of the pen,"" she identified no one who in Axelrod's words wanted to ""go out and hunt"" her because of the map. 
She also identified no specific family members or close friends who flagged the editorial's alleged unfairness. 
""After the editorial, things changed in terms of being called upon to advise and to help, and to be seen publicly on a high-profile political stage,"" Palin said.
Palin said she and her family in 2011 received death threats after she was wrongly linked to the Arizona attack, but did not sue because she wanted to focus on victims and not politicize the tragedy.
The Times editorial was different, she said. ""I knew something had to be done.""

Palin has signaled that if she loses at trial, she would on appeal challenge New York Times v Sullivan, the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that established the actual malice standard.
She was John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election, and Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.

The company also said fully vaccinated operations staff could work without a face covering starting on Friday as local regulations allow, according to a message to workers that Amazon shared with Reuters.
The online retailer attributed its policy updates to a recent decline in coronavirus cases across the United States, increasing rates of vaccination, and guidance from its medical experts and public health authorities.
""This is a positive sign we can return to the path to normal operations,"" the company's message said.
Amazon's COVID-19 protocols have faced scrutiny throughout the pandemic, as safety measures taken by the company have been met with criticism by some workers that it was not doing enough to protect them.

The company's status as America's second-biggest private employer, behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has added significance to its policies. Amazon had a full and part-time headcount greater than 1.6 million worldwide as of Dec. 31.
The retailer's paid leave change does not regard workers who have received a religious or medical accommodation, its message said. Unvaccinated employees without such accommodation can take unpaid time off for a week of COVID isolation, it said.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 11:32PM ET</span>","India's textile industry revs up, giving hope on jobs for PM Modi","By Krishna N. Das
HINDUPUR, India (Reuters) - At Texport Industries' factories in India's south, thousands of mostly women workers are busy converting yarn and fabrics into T-shirts, shirts, spaghetti tops and kids' clothes for U.S. customers of Tommy Hilfiger and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS).
After being outpaced in recent years by neighbouring Bangladesh and then hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic, India's garment factories are now humming near full capacity - a rare labour market bright spot for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling party as they head towards an election in 2024.
""We have been so busy,"" said Parashuram, the head of one of the Texport factories who goes by one name, as a batch of 60 new women recruits practiced stitching. ""We are constantly looking to hire workers.""
The company is scouting for land to add new factories around its main production base in Hindupur, about 100 km (60 miles) north of tech hub Bengaluru.
Sustained success for the textile and apparel (T&A) industry, the country's biggest employer after farming, is crucial if Modi is to succeed in taming unemployment.
India's jobless rate is above 7% and estimated to have exceeded the global average in five of the last six years - a massive problem for a country that must create millions of jobs each year just to keep pace with the young people joining the labour market.
HIGHER LABOUR COSTS
India is the world's fifth biggest T&A exporter with a 4% share of the $840 billion global market, while China controls more than a third of it. India's exports were on a par with closest rival Bangladesh about a decade ago but have lagged in recent years - especially on garments - partly due to higher labour costs that make Indian clothes some 20% costlier.
Indian T&A companies say they are now adding new clients, selling more to old ones and raising production capacity as foreign buyers seek to diversify their supply chains.
Other than China, only India has a big supply chain of everything from cotton to garments.
Still, some industry leaders said that unless India signed free trade agreements with Western countries - which New Delhi says it is working on - it would not be easy to outsell Bangladesh, which also enjoys preferential export terms from many buyers as a least developed country.
Indian companies such as Texport, Welspun India and Raymond - whose buyers include Western retailers Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Macy's (NYSE:M) - have managed to lift sales in recent quarters.
Modi wants them to create some 1.5 million jobs in the sector over the next five years or so.
India's junior textiles minister, Darshana Jardosh, on Wednesday listed recent announcements to support the industry, such as setting up seven huge all-in-one textile parks for about $600 million to further increase employment and make it easier for foreign buyers to place orders and monitor supply chains. The government has also proposed production-linked incentives worth $1.4 billion.
The American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) said India's ongoing and planned investments had resulted in ""more companies looking at India as a potential source of growth over the coming years"", without giving specifics.
Two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said both Fast Retailing's Uniqlo and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) were in talks to expand purchases from India. The companies, who source from India mainly from the country's biggest garments exporter Shahi Exports, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shahi Exports Managing Director Harish Ahuja declined to discuss individual buyers but said demand was high from its existing customers.
CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS?
India's April-December T&A exports soared 52% to $30.5 billion from the year-ago period, and the government has set a full fiscal-year target of $44 billion, which would be a record.
While global textile exports recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 2% between 2015 and 2019, India's shrank 0.8%, according to an industry report. Both Bangladesh and Vietnam grew at 10% or more.
One factor behind the surge in sales for Indian companies to the United States and Europe in the past few quarters has been alleged rights abuses in China's main cotton growing province of Xinjiang, where the minority Muslim Uyghur community lives.
U.S. President Joe Biden in late December signed into law legislation that bans imports from Xinjiang. China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses in Xinjiang.
The China Cotton Association referred Reuters to a December statement that warned of ""severe impact"" on its cotton textile industry because of the U.S. move.
Raymond, an Indian exporter of men's suits, jackets and denim, said the China factor helped it recently sign up new clients that it had long pursued.
""At current capacity, we may not be able to pick up as much as the orders coming our way, as much as buyers want to ship away from China,"" said Narendra Goenka, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council of India and a founder of family owned Texport.
Goenka said his company was spending some $25 million to raise its capacity by more than a quarter over the next two years, with the addition of 8,000 jobs on top of its current workforce of more than 10,000.

For 19-year-old Lopamudra Patel, from the eastern state of Odisha, whose family struggled to survive on her father's income as a part-time driver, the industry has come as a saviour. She joined Texport a few weeks ago for a monthly wage of $100.
""It was very difficult at home,"" she said, standing next to whirring sewing machines in the training room. ""I will now be able to send some money home.""

335,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 10:55PM ET</span>",Activist shareholder Quarz objects to terms of $3 billion Singapore REIT merger,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Activist investor Quarz Capital Management said it is opposed to the terms of a proposed S$4.2 billion ($3.1 billion) merger of two Temasek-linked Singapore real estate investment trusts, saying the target firm was significantly undervalued.
It is urging Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT) to negotiate an improved offer from Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT), according to a Feb. 9 open letter reviewed by Reuters.
Quarz, which has previously been successful in blocking a Singapore REIT deal, says it and its affiliates hold stakes that rank them among the top 10 unitholders of MNACT (SI:MAPE).
In a report published on research platform Smartkarma on Friday, analyst Travis Lundy said Quarz had provided many statements in its letter about how things would change on the MNACT side once the COVID-19 pandemic ended but had not addressed the impact on MCT .
MNACT's main portfolio includes one commercial property in Hong Kong and two in China, while MCT is a Singapore-focused REIT.
On Thursday, MNACT's units were down 1.8% before the Reuters story and ended up 0.9% on the day at S$1.12. On Friday, MNACT's units traded 1.8% lower.
""We note that Quarz acknowledges the deal rationale...and sees value in MNACT,"" MCT's manager said in a response to Reuters, but did not elaborate.
MNACT's manager said it continued to believe that the rationale and terms of the proposed merger were beneficial to unitholders from a strategic and financial perspective.
Singapore state investor Temasek declined comment. Its Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd, a global real estate conglomerate, is the single largest unitholder in both real estate investment trusts (REITs), owning 32.6% of MCT and 38.1% of MNACT as of Dec. 29.
On Dec. 31, MCT had announced plans to buy MNACT, seeking to create the seventh-largest REIT in Asia with an expected market valuation of about S$10.5 billion. 
""We have received a substantial number of positive responses from MNACT unitholders who are institutional investors, family offices and retail investors since the open letter,"" Jan Moermann, chief investment officer at Quarz, said in a response to Reuters. 
Quarz said in the letter that it supports the deal rationale but objects to the merger ratio and price.
""We agree that the offer is value destructive to unitholders and significantly undervalues MNACT,"" Moermann and Havard Chi, Quarz's Singapore-based research head, said in the letter.
MCT offered to acquire all units of MNACT in exchange for MCT units, or a combination of both cash and MCT units that gave the target's unitholders S$1.1949 per unit.
This represented a 7.6% premium to MNACT's Dec. 27 closing price of S$1.11 and was based on MCT's unitprice of S$2. The companies said the offer was in line with MNACT's net asset value (NAV) per unit. 
Since then, MCT's units have fallen 9% to trade at S$1.82 on Friday.
""It appears that many Singaporean holders of MCT are thinking that a merger with MNACT would be a quality downgrade,"" said Lundy.
Quarz said ""MNACT's board and management should initiate a transparent and robust process to sell the assets above NAV of S$1.23 instead of recommending the suboptimal offer of S$1.08-S$1.10 from MCT.""
It added it was confident MNACT would stage a strong recovery from the second half of 2022, citing rising global COVID-19 vaccination rates.

Singapore's REIT market is dominated by retail investors who are attracted to the high dividends paid by trusts as the firms are mandated to pay out 90% of their rental income. Quarz mustered support to block a merger in 2020 between two Singapore REITs, whose managers are owned by a unit of Asian logistics giant ESR Cayman Ltd.

The addition would bring the family's total contribution to $5.325 billion to get a handful of U.S. state attorneys general to drop their opposition to Purdue's bankruptcy plan, the report said citing people familiar with the matter. 
Purdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Earlier this week, a mediator reported that the OxyContin-maker and U.S. states were ""even closer"" to a settlement over claims that the company fueled a U.S. opioid epidemic.
The mediator asked a bankruptcy judge to extend the deadline for negotiations to Feb. 16 from Feb. 7, saying that the two sides need more time to finalize a deal that would involve ""substantial"" additional money from the Sacklers. The new settlement would also include non-monetary concessions.

Purdue, the maker of the highly addictive opioid pain drug OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and wealthy Sackler family members who owned the company of helping cause the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing that played down addiction and overdose risks.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, alongside bonds and U.S. shares. Investors continuing to reel from higher-than-expected U.S. inflation that hit a record four-month high.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.61% by 9:22 PM ET (2:22 AM GMT) and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.77%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.47%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.20% and the Shenzhen Component edge down 0.14%.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, and there will be no cash trading.
In the U.S., the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 led declines as U.S. shares broke a two-day upward trend. Antipodean bonds also fell, with the Australian three-year yield hitting its highest level since 2019. In the U.S., the two-year Treasury yield Thursday saw its biggest one-day surge since 2009 on Thursday, while Treasury futures were steady.
The combination of sharp losses in U.S. Treasuries and a flattening yield curb indicated that investors expect the economic recovery to slow down and a more hawkish Federal Reserve.
The U.S. data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 7.5% year-on-year, and 0.6% month-on-month, in January. The core CPI grew 0.6% month-on-month and 6% year-on-year. It also triggered hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said the Fed should hike rates by 100 basis points over the next three meetings. Bullard also raised the possibility of considering moves outside the scheduled policy reviews.
The latest market volatility reflected investors’ difficulty in adjusting to the Fed’s potential monetary policy tightening to curb inflation. Overnight index swaps started pricing an approximately 80% chance of a 50-basis-point interest rate hike at the Fed’s March 2022 meeting, followed by 25 basis points priced for May and June.
“We don’t think the market has priced the full extent of what we feel the Fed has to do going forward,” GenTrust LLC principal at investment manager Elena Hernandez told Bloomberg.
“Bullard’s comments today were a big shock and surprise, especially talking about a potential inter-meeting movement. We expect rates to continue to sell off.”
Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that tightening monetary policy too quickly could harm the eurozone’s economic recovery.

(Reuters) -A California state agency has sued Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc over allegations by some Black workers that the company tolerated racial discrimination at an assembly plant, adding to claims made in several other lawsuits against the electric car maker.
The lawsuit filed in state court late on Wednesday by the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) said Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, is racially segregated and that Black workers claim they are subjected to racist slurs and drawings and assigned the most physically demanding jobs.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The company said in a blog post https://www.reuters.com/business/tesla-says-california-dfeh-sue-company-over-alleged-discrimination-2022-02-09 on Wednesday it was expecting the lawsuit, which it called misguided.
The DFEH said working conditions at the plant are so intolerable that many Black employees have been forced to quit.
""Workers referred to the Tesla factory as the 'slaveship' or 'the plantation,' where defendants’ production leads 'crack (ed) the whip,'"" the agency said in the complaint.
Tesla said in the blog post that over the past five years, DFEH had concluded that nearly 50 individual discrimination complaints against the company lacked merit, contradicting the agency's claims of widespread discrimination. The company said it does not tolerate harassment and has disciplined and fired workers who engaged in misconduct. 
""A narrative spun by the DFEH and a handful of plaintiff firms to generate publicity is not factual proof,"" the company said. 
As Tesla has grown to become the world's most valuable automaker https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-shares/tesla-becomes-most-valuable-automaker-in-latest-stock-rally-idUSKBN2426E8, it has faced mounting claims involving pervasive racial and sexual harassment at its flagship Fremont plant and other facilities. 
A federal jury in October awarded $137 million to Owen Diaz, a former employee at the Fremont plant who said managers ignored his complaints about constant racial harassment including slurs and swastikas scrawled on bathroom walls.
A judge in that case is considering Tesla's bid for a new trial or to lower the award, which is one of the largest in a discrimination lawsuit by a single worker.
The company is also defending against similar claims in a proposed class action https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-lawsuit/tesla-hit-by-class-action-lawsuit-claiming-racial-discrimination-idUSKBN1DD2RS on behalf of factory workers in California state court. A judge last year rejected Tesla's bid to dismiss the claims.
Tesla has denied wrongdoing in those cases, and has said it has implemented various policies in recent years to prevent racist conduct and punish it when it does occur.
While the allegations in the DFEH lawsuit are similar to those in pending cases, it will likely cover many more workers because the agency is not bound by agreements most Tesla employees have signed to bring legal claims in arbitration rather than court, according to Lawrence Organ, a lawyer for Diaz and the plaintiff in the class action. 
""So this is really a great day for those workers because they will get their day in court,"" Organ said.
The DFEH said Black workers are assigned difficult, menial jobs in segregated areas of the factory known as ""the dark side,"" and are less likely to be promoted to management positions. They are subjected to racial slurs including the ""N-word,"" and ""hood rats"" on a daily basis, according to the complaint. 

The agency also said Tesla's human resources department is ""understaffed and inadequately trained,"" leading to a failure to address complaints by workers. In 2020, the company had one HR professional for every 740 employees, the DFEH said. 
The DFEH can seek the same kind of relief as workers who file lawsuits, including court orders barring future discrimination and money damages. The penalties can be significant: In December, Riot Games agreed to pay https://www.reuters.com/business/riot-games-agrees-pay-100-mln-settle-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-2021-12-28 $100 million to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit by the agency.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican investment platform Flink will begin operating in Colombia in June or July as part of its Latin America expansion plan, Chief Executive Sergio Jimenez said on Thursday.
The platform, which enables subscribers to invest in fractions of shares of U.S. listed companies, will also add Mexican debt instruments, like state bonds, to diversify its investment portfolio, Jimenez said.
Flink caters to first-time investors who can get started with a minimum of 30 pesos ($1.46).
About 300,000 Mexicans had investment accounts in 2019, or well under 1% of the population, according to company data. 
Flink has 1.6 million subscribers and aims to reach 4 million in 2022.
""The average ticket for newcomers is at $1 or $2, but it reaches $32 in the fourth month. People get confident when they understand the market,"" said Jimenez.
The company decided to launch the platform with U.S.-listed companies to give clients ""the opportunity to invest in fractional shares."" The enterprises abroad are more attractive to customers, Jimenez said.
Data shared by Flink shows that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are the companies in which users invested the most in the last 12 months.
Flink was conceived as a way to provide digital banking solutions, but the company later decided ""to focus on giving people access to the markets,"" said Jimenez.
Flink is working with regulators to modernize Mexico's brokerage system. One of the main obstacles to market access is that Mexico's legal framework does not allow digital onboarding to brokerages, but it should soon, Jimenez said. 
Investors need to go physically to a brokerage to create investment accounts, he said.
Flink is also eyeing countries like Peru, Chile and Argentina for expansion, and aims to ""work around regulations to land more investment opportunities for its users,"" said Jimenez.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is stepping up plans to extensively electrify its Lincoln brand in North America, as it prepares to introduce at least five new battery-powered Lincoln sport utility vehicles through 2026, three people familiar with the plans told Reuters.
Included are battery-electric models that will replace or supplement the Lincoln Corsair, Nautilus, Aviator and Navigator, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
The strategy to electrify Lincoln is a key element of Ford's planned $30 billion investment in EVs and batteries through 2030. Ford announced the $30 billion initiative in May 2021.

On Thursday, Lincoln spokeswoman Anika Salceda-Wycoco said it was ""too early to talk about specific details around future vehicle or production plans.""
The first of the new Lincoln EVs, a large crossover about the size of the Aviator, is slated to begin production in late 2024 or early 2025 at Ford's Oakville, Ontario, plant, as part of a $1.5 billion changeover there from combustion-engine to battery electric vehicles, two of the sources said, citing the automaker's plans shared with suppliers.
Several more Lincoln EV crossovers, including potential replacements for the compact Corsair and the mid-size Nautilus, could be built in Oakville in 2025-2026, said the two sources, who cited internal planning documents. Production plans for those models have not been finalized.
Several of the smaller Lincoln EVs will share an improved version of the EV platform that underpins the Ford Mustang Mach E, the sources said.
A larger Lincoln SUV, a battery-powered companion to the big Navigator, is scheduled to go into production in 2026, the sources said. It will share a new dedicated EV truck platform with the next-generation Ford F-150 Lightning, the sources said.
Ford's plans to transform the Lincoln brand in North America into a mostly electric family of premium utility vehicles parallels an effort at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), where the Cadillac brand has embarked on a similar makeover, starting this year with the mid-size Lyriq electric crossover.

Eventually, Cadillac is expected to field a full portfolio of electric utility vehicles, GM executives have previously said, including a full-size Escalade EV that is expected to share its underpinnings with the Hummer and Silverado EVs. 
Cadillac also plans to introduce an ultra-luxury sedan called Celestiq in 2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) on Thursday said it will aim for 25% of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030, a move hailed by environmental groups who have called out the soft-drink maker for worldwide plastic pollution.
Coca-Cola is a top target for consumer, investor and environmental groups concerned about petroleum-based plastic single-use bottles clogging oceans, among other problems. 
The company was the world's worst plastic polluter for the fourth year in a row in 2021, according to the global coalition Break Free From Plastic's annual report released in October. 
""We hope that other companies will follow Coke's leadership and set reusable packaging targets,"" said the group's global corporate campaign coordinator Emma Priestland.
Reusable packaging includes containers that can be refilled with original product by companies or consumers, such as refillable fountain drink containers and glass and plastic bottles that are refillable or returnable, the cola maker said, referring to reuse guidelines by nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
In 2020, 16% of the company's packaging was reusable. That year, 90% of its refillable glass and plastic containers were collected, it said.
Coca-Cola's announcement on Thursday is ""the first known goal of its kind"" and ""a welcome change in strategy,"" fund manager Green Century Capital Management said in a statement.
Green Century and activist investor As You Sow filed a shareholder proposal urging Coca-Cola to reduce single-use plastic. They are now considering whether to withdraw their proposal.
If Coca-Cola hits its new goal, it will be ""easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday.
Eight in 10 American adults support government policies to reduce single-use plastic, according to a poll released on Wednesday by advocacy group Oceana.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and other international brands in January called for a global pact that included calls to cut plastic production, a key growth area for the oil industry.
Break Free From Plastic cleaned beaches in 45 countries and found nearly 20,000 Coca-Cola branded products, more than the next two largest plastic polluters - PepsiCo Inc and Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC - combined.

The news sent the company's shares up 4% to A$4.74, their highest in more than two months.
Adverse weather conditions in Australia have triggered a wave of claims, prompting many insurers to bump up their cost forecasts to cover natural perils claims for the full year. 
Earlier this week, peer Suncorp reported a 29% drop in first-half cash earnings.
IAG (LON:ICAG), Australia's top general insurer, said costs related to net natural perils claims were A$681 million ($487.94 million) for the half year, nearly A$299 million above the allowance it had set aside for the period.
The company posted cash earnings of A$176 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with A$462 million a year ago, but declared a dividend of 6 Australian cents per share. 

Citi had estimated cash earnings of A$129 million and a dividend of 5 Australian cents.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday after U.S. consumer prices data came in hotter than expected and subsequent comments from a Federal Reserve official raised fears the U.S. central bank will hike rates aggressively to fight inflation.
U.S. Labor Department data showed consumer prices surged 7.5% last month on a year-over-year basis, topping economists' estimates of 7.3% and marking the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years.
U.S. stocks fell further after St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said the data had made him ""dramatically"" more hawkish. Bullard, a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year, said he now wanted a full percentage point of interest rate hikes by July 1.
""Inflation tends to be kryptonite to valuations. Higher inflation causes multiples to compress, and that's what we're experiencing right now,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
""Volatility is likely to remain until in the number and magnitude of Fed rate hikes is better known."" 
Within minutes of Bullard comments, rate futures contracts were fully pricing an increase in the Fed's target range for its policy rate to 1%-1.25% by the end of its policy meeting in June, with some bets on an even steeper rate hike path.
Megacap growth stocks Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) each lost around 3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.47% to end at 35,241.59 points, while the S&P 500 lost 1.81% to 4,504.06. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.1% to 14,185.64. It was the seventh time in 2022 that the Nasdaq lost more than 2% in a session.
The S&P 500 is now down about 5% in 2022, and the Nasdaq is down about 9%.
All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with technology (SPLRCT), down 2.75%, and real estate, down 2.86%, leading the way lower.
Meanwhile, U.S. companies continued to report upbeat quarterly results. With 78% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported results beating analysts' profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co rose 3.4% after beating revenue and profit estimates on strong subscriber additions and attendance at U.S. theme parks.
Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) and cereal maker Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co gained 7.65% and 3.11%, respectively, after forecasting full-year profits above market expectations.
Thursday's session was busy. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.8 billion shares, compared with a 12.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

By Aditi Sebastian
(Reuters) - Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) Inc cut its full-year revenue and profit forecasts on Thursday, as Omicron-related restrictions dampen demand for the company's luxury parkas and footwear, sending its shares down nearly 20%.
Shuttered stores and weak retail traffic due to Omicron-related curbs in key markets including Germany and China are weighing on the luxury parka maker's sales as shoppers stay indoors.
Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss told Reuters he was uncertain about a recovery timeline, but added that the company was still seeing strong demand.
Toronto, Ontario-based Canada Goose has been ramping up investments in its online platforms to cushion the blow from store closures and reduced footfall, helping the company to post a 28.1% jump in global e-commerce revenue in the third quarter.
The company's direct-to-consumer sales, which include sales from its own retail outlets and online business, in mainland China rose 35.1% in the third quarter, compared with an 85.9% jump in the second quarter.
""Following a very strong November, we observed a slowdown in store traffic (in China) in December, which carried through into the current quarter."" Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Sinclair said.
U.S. and Canada shares of the company plunged to their lowest in more than a year.
The share move clearly reflects the market's concerns of intensifying weakness in China and a downbeat fourth-quarter guidance, Berenberg analyst Brian McNamara said in a note.
The company said it now expects revenue for fiscal 2022 to be between C$1.090 billion and C$1.105 billion, compared with its prior estimate of between C$1.125 billion and C$1.175 billion.

Canada Goose said it expects an adjusted profit of C$1.02 to C$1.11 per share for fiscal 2022, down from its prior forecast of between C$1.17 and C$1.33.

By Eva Mathews and Akash Sriram
(Reuters) - The strong subscriber additions by Disney+ in the latest quarter helped Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's flagship streaming service close the gap with market leader Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), but industry watchers focused on future prospects for streaming in a saturating market.
Disney+ added 11.8 million https://reut.rs/3suczXC subscribers in the first quarter as viewers signed up to watch hits like ""The Mandalorian"" and ""Black Widow"".
However, a closer look at the numbers showed some of that boost was from Disney's move to bundle Disney+ and ESPN+ with one tier of its Hulu Live service.
Analyst Michael Nathanson of Moffett Nathanson highlighted that 2 million subscriptions were a result of the automatic bundle with Hulu Live and another 2.6 million came from Disney+ Hotstar, which generates about $1 monthly revenue per user.
The media giant's reaffirmation of its long-term goals and a forecast that the second half of the year would grow more strongly than the first half was in sharp contrast to Netflix's gloomy outlook https://reut.rs/3rDdhTh last month.
""Disney may have room to grow on the streaming subscription front but at some point it will hit saturation point,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Disney's shares rose more than 5% in early trading.
""For now, Disney is defending its competitive position against older players, but this isn't the walk in the park one might expect from a company with a content cupboard already brimming with famous blockbusters,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said.
To be sure, Disney is still well behind Netflix in terms of overall subscriber numbers.
The two-year-old streaming service's total subscribers stood at 129.8 million as of last year, as viewers paid to watch ""The Book of Boba Fett"", and ""The Beatles: Get Back"" and Oscar-nominated animated film ""Encanto"".
Netflix had about 222 million total paid memberships, as of 2021.
During its post-earnings conference call, Disney executives stressed the importance of local content as the U.S. market saturates. The company recently appointed Rebecca Campbell to double down on international content.
Netflix has successfully leaned on locally produced content to counter the lack of legacy blockbusters, attracting millions of international subscribers with shows such as ""Squid Game"", ""Money Heist"" and ""Lupin"".
Disney's finance chief Christine McCarthy said on the earnings call that out of the $33 billion in total spending, about a third is set aside for sports and the remainder for content.

""With Disney+ coming to 42 more countries in the summer of 2022, the international growth story may prove more important than the U.S.,"" said Joe McCormack, senior analyst at Third Bridge.

(Reuters) -Automakers and some manufacturers are looking to the skies as they seek alternatives for moving products caught up in Canadian trucking protests that have hit supply chains on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, union and industry executives said.
Protesters have occupied key border crossings between the United States and Canada as part of two-week old demonstrations against pandemic measures and vaccine mandates.
With more than two-thirds of the C$650 billion ($511 billion) in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States moving via roads, the choking of key arteries has upended already stressed supply chains. 
That has manufacturers, including automakers like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co looking for alternative routes and forms of transportation to move supplies.
Ford is looking at flying in some auto parts to a plant in Windsor, Ontario that produces engines for popular models, an official with the union representing auto workers at the plant said on Thursday.
Mike Stopay, director of Toronto-area cargo specialist Pacer Air Freight, said he had received requests from some auto-parts and pharmaceutical companies to transport products by air due to the protests on the vital Ambassador Bridge.
""All these parts are needed just in time,"" he said. ""I can't take the chance to sit around at the border for eight hours.""
A spokesperson for Ford's Canadian division said: ""We are looking at all options to keep our plants running.""
A spokesperson for  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) said the Canadian parts supplier ""had to be a bit creative"" by using other ports of entry into Canada and the United States. 
Matt Poirier, director of trade policy for trade and industry association the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, said some companies were looking at alternative routes, but were running into roadblocks as other sites were backed by traffic and protests, raising costs.
""What complicates it for manufacturers is that not only do they have to figure out the logistics of getting a truck there, but then all the paperwork they've done to move stuff across the border changes too,"" he said.
""So administratively it's a nightmare."" 
The protests are the latest challenge for the auto sector on both sides of the border, which has already been wrestling with a global shortage of semiconductors, along with COVID-19. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis said on Thursday they were forced to cancel or scale back some production because of parts shortages due to the protests against pandemic measures.
Dino Chiodo, director of automotive at Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, said the union had heard that Ford was looking at alternatives like flying to bring in parts to support production at an engine plant in Windsor.
""They're looking at alternative methods to get the parts into the Windsor Essex engine plant so they don't negatively impact their production,"" Chiodo said.

Chiodo questioned how a group supposedly protesting for more freedoms was now leading to the closings of workplaces. 
""The reality is that they are the ones causing us to be shut down,"" he said.

The bank, however, said it will likely maintain its return on equity, a gauge of profitability, around 20%.
Its loan book is likely to grow between 9% and 12%, below its expansion last year, the bank said. Still, its net interest income with clients should grow at a faster pace, between 20.5% and 23.5%. 
As consumers and companies feel the burden of little or no economic growth this year, loan-loss provisions are likely to stand up to 9 billion reais above last year. Cash set aside for bad loans is likely to be between 25 billion reais and 29 billion reais, the bank said.
Itau also sees Brazil's inflation pushing up its operating costs, which are expected to rise between 3.5% and 6.5%. Last year, the lender was able to tame double digit inflation, with its expenses growing just 2%.
Despite fiercer competition among banks and fintechs, Itau expects its fee income to go up between 3.5% and 6.5%.
""Our outlook for 2022 factors in our keeping on a recovery
path and the good results achieved in 2021,"" Chief Executive Milton Maluhy said in a statement.
QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE
Itau posted on Thursday a higher-than-expected fourth quarter profit, mainly driven by strong gains in consumer lending and in its insurance unit.
Recurring net income, which excludes one-off items, rose 32.9% from a year earlier to 7.159 billion reais ($1.36 billion), above a consensus estimate of 6.828 billion reais compiled by Refinitiv.
The bank's 90-day loan default ratio was roughly in line with the third quarter, at 2.5%.

A Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, made a big splash last year with documents showing that subsidiary Instagram was harmful to teenagers while others have alleged that social media platforms spread dangerous misinformation about coronavirus and the vaccines to prevent it, among other ills.
Under the bill, the National Science Foundation and National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine would do a study into potential interventions that Facebook or others could use to address problems of social media addiction, Klobuchar's office said in a release on Thursday.
The Federal Trade Commission would create rules based on the findings, and hold the platforms accountable if they do not comply, the release said.

""For too long, tech companies have said 'Trust us, we've got this.' But we know that social media platforms have repeatedly put profits over people, with algorithms pushing dangerous content that hooks users and spreads misinformation. This bill will help address these practices,"" said Klobuchar in a statement.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook declined to comment but pointed to a blog post in December that said it would implement new tools for Instagram that would, for example, stop people from tagging teens who don't follow them or to take a break from the screen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court freed the New York Times to publish documents concerning the conservative activist group Project Veritas, putting on hold a lower court ruling that alarmed First Amendment advocates.In an order made public on Thursday, the Appellate Division in Brooklyn stayed a December ruling https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/judge-orders-new-york-times-return-project-veritas-internal-memos-2021-12-24 that blocked the Times from publishing memoranda from an in-house Project Veritas lawyer, and required the newspaper to turn over or destroy the memos.
Critics called the ruling by Justice Charles Wood of the state Supreme Court in Westchester County an unconstitutional prior restraint. Project Veritas has said the memos are protected by attorney-client privilege.
While not setting aside Wood's ruling, Thursday's order means it will not be enforced during the Times' appeal.
Elizabeth Locke, a lawyer for Project Veritas, said she was pleased the court denied the Times' ""overreaching request"" to vacate the ruling, and was confident it would find that the Times ""violated Veritas' substantial rights by acquiring and publishing attorney-client privileged materials in the midst of ongoing litigation.""
The Times welcomed the order. ""The use of prior restraint to prohibit newsgathering and block the publication of newsworthy journalism is unconstitutional,"" spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said. ""No libel plaintiffs should be permitted to use their litigation as a tool to silence press coverage about them.""
Led by James O'Keefe, Project Veritas has used what critics view as deceptive tactics to expose what it describes as liberal media bias.
The Times obtained the disputed memos in connection with coverage concerning a U.S. Department of Justice probe into Project Veritas' possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.
Project Veritas objected to a Nov. 11 Times article that drew from the memos, calling it an attempt to embarrass a litigation opponent.
The group is suing Times for defamation over an unrelated September 2020 article describing a video it released about alleged voter fraud in Minnesota.
Wood concluded that the disputed memos were not a matter of public concern, and that barring coverage would not unconstitutionally restrain the Times' journalism.
The newspaper's editorial board called his ruling dangerous https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/opinion/project-veritas-new-york-times.html, saying courts should not tell media how to report the news.

The Times had not faced a prior restraint since 1971.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell sharply Thursday after a Federal Reserve official stoked fears of aggressive rate hike, sending Treasury yields soaring just as data showed inflation climbed to multi-decade highs.
The S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5%, or 526 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.1%.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard threw his weight behind the idea of the Fed hiking rates 1% by July,  after consumer price inflation that jumped by a more than expected 7.5% for the 12 months through January, the fastest pace since 1982.
“I’d like to see 100 basis points in the bag by July 1,” Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg. “I was already more hawkish but I have pulled up dramatically what I think the committee should do."" 
Bullard also suggested that he would be in favor of the Fed hiking rates in-between meetings, which caught the market by surprise as it “signals that maybe the Fed is becoming more worried about inflation,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday.
“The quarter point increase was certainly priced into markets, with Fed futures market implying about a 90% probability recently, but I'm not sure that a half point or more frequent quarter points were priced in,"" Brown added.
Bets on the Fed hiking rates by 50 basis points next month jumped to 89.9% from 24% a day earlier, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 5% to top 2% for the first time in more than two years, drawing a bout of risk aversion across stocks, with tech bearing the brunt of the pressure.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) edged more than 1% lower.
There were some positives in the markets, however, as the parade of quarterly earnings from corporates continued to mostly impress.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was up 0.5% after reporting fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations, though a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current year amid inflation pressures kept gains in check.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) also delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines, and also flagged concerns about rising input costs for the year ahead. Its shares were down nearly 2%.
Walt Disney  (NYSE:DIS), meanwhile, was up more than 3% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, underpinned by strong growth in its parks business and upbeat subscriber numbers.
“Management continues to expect that net adds in FY22 will be higher in the second-half vs. the first-half of the year, which potentially suggests upside to consensus estimates, and we see the strong programming slate as justifying another price increase over the coming quarters,” RBC said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Thursday that its 2022 round of large bank stress tests will include a severe decline in commercial real estate prices and turmoil in corporate bond markets.
The hypothetical recession the Fed will use as the basis of its tests also envisions unemployment spiking to 10% over two years. Commercial real estate prices will fall 40% over that time frame, while corporate debt and other assets will collapse in value. The test will be applied to 34 of the nation's largest banks.
The 2022 test tracks closely to the test banks underwent in 2021, with some minor changes. The unemployment rate spikes to 10% compared to 10.75% in 2021 -- however, the jobless rate in 2022 is well below where it stood when the 2021 scenarios were released.

The 2022 test also includes a sharp decline in the U.S. economy, followed by a quick recovery. The test envisions the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) falls over 3.5% over a little more than a year -- a sharper but briefer decline than the 2021 test.
As it has in prior years, the Fed said banks with large trading operations would be tested against a global market shock, while banks with large trading and custodial operations would be tested against the hypothetical default of their largest counterparty.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) - The United States will help the United Arab Emirates replenish interceptors it uses to knock down incoming missiles following a spate of unprecedented attacks by Houthi fighters in Yemen, the U.S. general overseeing Middle East operations told Reuters.
In recent weeks, the Iran-aligned Houthis have waged a string of largely failed strikes on UAE targets that have triggered Emirati and U.S. air defenses and have even seen American troops based there briefly taking shelter.
""We will help with replenishment of interceptors. And we'll do everything we can to assist UAE in defending themselves,"" General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said in an interview after a trip to Abu Dhabi earlier this week.
McKenzie did not offer further specifics. The UAE has privately requested U.S. replenishment of missile defense interceptors, including for its THAAD and Patriot system, a source familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The latest U.S. move would be in addition to the Pentagon's announcement last week of a deployment of a guided missile destroyer and advanced U.S. F-22 fighter jets to the UAE. It would also stick closely to defensive support, amid stiff opposition to the war in Yemen among many lawmakers in Congress due to civilian deaths.
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and caused a humanitarian crisis. 
The Houthi attacks have thrown a spotlight on so-far unsuccessful U.N.-led efforts to broker an end to the war in Yemen, which since 2015 has pitted the Houthis against a Saudi Arabian-led military coalition that includes the UAE.
McKenzie, who has also expressed concern about Houthi attacks against ally Saudi Arabia, acknowledged that the United States has been grappling with significant limits on U.S. surveillance capability over Yemen, noting its size.
""We're very limited in ISR over Yemen. It's hard to see into Yemen,"" McKenzie said, using an acronym for military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, which include drones.
""It's a large country, and you have to make decisions on priorities."" 
Experts say it can be difficult to help allies detect and destroy Houthi launch sites without adequate ISR, particularly when dealing with mobile missile launchers. 
Aware of their value, Houthis target U.S. drones. The Houthis have shot down two U.S.-operated drones since McKenzie took command in March 2019 and far more drones operated by regional allies.
With tensions simmering around the world, from North Korea to Ukraine, the Pentagon has to deal with competing priorities for ISR resources, which also include satellite imagery.
""I communicate with partners where we are with Yemen. I communicate with our (U.S. defense) secretary all the time about the resources that we need,"" McKenzie said, without identifying any specific request.
""So it's an informed dialogue that goes on within the department of defense.""
McKenzie declined to speculate whether the Pentagon might dedicate additional ISR to Yemen, saying: ""Anything is possible.""

Although it has long targeted Saudi Arabia, the Houthi movement last month responded to battlefield losses with the unprecedented assaults on UAE, sources say.
The conflict https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fighting-eases-yemens-marib-saudi-led-coalition-revamps-forces-2022-02-08 is largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which the United States accuses of arming the Houthis. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 03:50PM ET</span>",Customers sue Bank of America for not refunding overdraft fees during pandemic,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is facing a lawsuit seeking class action status filed on Thursday by two customers who say the bank refused to honor promises to refund overdraft fees to clients who faced financial hardship during the pandemic. 
Anthony Ramirez, a truck driver living in California, and Masako Williams, an 85-year-old retiree living in Texas, say they asked the bank to refund them for several hundred dollars worth of overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees (NSF) that they were charged in 2020 and 2021 when they experienced a lack of work for themselves or the family members that support them.
Like many banks, Bank of America pledged at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide needy customers with financial assistance, and to refund certain overdraft and NSF fees, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California.
Bank of America spokesperson William Halldin did not comment on the case directly but said that the bank ""provided tens of millions of dollars in fee waivers during the height of the pandemic in 2020.""
Banks are already facing increased scrutiny from regulators over overdraft and NSF fees. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is exploring new guidance aimed at curbing banks' reliance on the fees, and is seeking testimonials from customers about these and other ""junk fees."" 
Bank of America said in January it would reduce overdraft fees to $10 from $35 starting this May, and that it would stop charging a $35 nonsufficient funds fee for things like bounced checks and automated account withdrawals that the bank rejects. 
Ramirez and Williams say bank representatives repeatedly denied their refund requests and that it appeared the bank did not have an adequate system in place to grant the refund.
For example, Williams was once denied a refund by a bank representative who said ""the computer program used would not allow"" it, according to the lawsuit.

""Bank of America told people, 'If you have a problem, call us and we will refund your overdraft fees,'"" Hassan Zavareei, a founding partner of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Tycko & Zavareei, told Reuters in an interview. 
""They made that promise but they didn't create or implement any systems to take advantage of those promises.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday for delays to its landmark climate change risk disclosure rules and called for ""quick action"" on the issue.
Last year, the SEC began working on a new rule requiring U.S.-listed companies to provide investors with detailed disclosures on how climate change could affect their business. The SEC initially said it would publish a draft in October, but Chair Gary Gensler subsequently pushed that deadline to January. 
Reuters reported last month that the agency was trying to decide whether it should require companies to disclose not only their own greenhouse gas emissions, but those generated by their suppliers and other partners. Bloomberg reported this week that the agency's commissioners are divided over how far to go.
Warren's letter will increase pressure on Gensler to deliver a game-changing rule that would reveal all the emissions for which a company is responsible. 
""I urge you to act quickly and to release the strongest requirements possible to begin the formal rulemaking process,"" Warren wrote in a letter to Gensler.
""These delays are unwarranted and unacceptable, and violate the commitment, which you made seven months ago...the absence of a rule leaves shareholders and investors in the dark about the significant long- and short-term climate risks facing public companies,"" she added.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Its climate rule is part of a broader effort by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change challenges.

Investors also say they need corporate climate risk data to fully assess companies' exposure to climate change and related policy measures.
Corporate groups, meanwhile, are pushing for a narrower rule that will make it easier and less expensive to gather and report emissions data, and which will protect them from being sued over potential mistakes.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Cemex's net profit nearly tripled on lower costs and taxes in the fourth quarter, the Mexican cement maker said on Thursday, as it announced plans to raise prices in line with inflation in 2022.
Net profit reached $195 million, up about 179% from the year-ago period, while revenues rose to $3.62 billion from $3.5 billion a year earlier.
Cemex said it expected operating 2022 Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to increase in the single digits, and for cement prices to keep rising.
Last year, cement prices grew 5%, the biggest jump since 2016, Cemex executives said in an online presentation on the results.
Chief Financial Officer Maher Al-Haffar said the company expected inflation to fluctuate this year.
Cemex will invest $900 million on growth starting this year, Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez said, without elaborating. 
The company has a 50% alternative fuel substitution target by 2030, Gonzalez added, up from almost 30% in 2021. It saved $200 million by using alternative fuels in 2021.

(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc laid out a $5 billion operating profit for 2024 that fell short of analyst estimates, sending its shares down 4% on Thursday, even as the ride-hailing company revealed several strategies to boost ridership and bring down costs.
The forecast is below the $5.7 billion analysts expect for 2024, according to Refinitiv data. The stock reversed course after being up as much as 5% earlier in the day.
Speaking at the company's first investor day, Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said Uber (NYSE:UBER) will report around $5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation.
""We think it's a worthwhile target. Could there be upside? Absolutely, but let's work on that target for now,"" Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said.
The company expects to also report gross bookings of between $165 billion and $175 billion in 2024, Chai said.
Analysts had forecast gross bookings of $169.73 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Kauffman said ""2024 looks like conservative revenue growth,"" but he added that some of the money Uber was investing in new businesses will pay off with higher profitability after 2024.
Speaking during an in-person event in New York that was live-streamed, company executives said they planned to better fuse its two platforms - ride-hail and food delivery - into one cost-saving marketplace.
Khosrowshahi said a better combination of its rides and delivery business would reduce customer acquisition costs - a metric investors closely follow in a market where companies have long competed by outbidding each other with costly customer discounts and incentives.
The company is also tweaking its algorithms to ensure more workers signed up for both ride-hail and delivery services, Khosrowshahi said, adding that it would improve driver dispatching and allow for higher utilization of each worker.
But Uber's senior vice president for mobility, Andrew Macdonald, said the company also had to bring down prices to grow its customer base. 
""Most of our total addressable market exists below the price UberX is at today,"" he said, referring to Uber's standard ride-hail option.
Ride-hail prices in the U.S. have spiked in recent months as Uber and its smaller competitor  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) struggle to serve a resurgence in demand as they battle to bring back drivers who left their platforms during the pandemic.
Graphic on U.S. ride-hail pricing: https://tmsnrt.rs/3HGTB6l
Macdonald said the company still had a large pool of untapped customers in the global markets it operates in, with only a small share of the adult population in each country using Uber on a regular basis. 
Graphic on global Uber market share: https://tmsnrt.rs/3szFKsg
Since Uber went public in May 2019, its shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, nearly halving at the start of the pandemic in early 2020, when the company's ride-hail business came to a screeching halt.
The company is trying to turn a corner and is hoping to capitalize as pandemic restrictions subside in many of its core markets.
Food delivery orders, which emerged as a lifeline to Uber and have tripled since the start of the pandemic, have not taken a hit as countries reopen. Uber executives said its Eats business offered many opportunities to cross-sell customers and get them interested in rides and other products.
Khosrowshahi said that while Uber was focused heavily on chaining its businesses, it would also put more emphasis on growing its membership program, Uber One, going forward.
Uber executives also said they were addressing regulatory challenges surrounding the status of their gig worker drivers.
Reuters last year reported exclusively that U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29 a lot of gig workers should be classified as ""employees"" who deserve work benefits, instead of remaining independent contractors with no benefits. Such a reclassification would threaten gig companies' business model.

Uber senior vice president of public Affairs, Jill Hazelbaker, on Thursday said the company had built a ""very collaborative relationship"" with Walsh.
""As of now we don't see federal independent contractor regulation on the agenda,"" Hazelbaker said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday proposed changing the rules of its whistleblower program to make it easier for tipsters to claim bounties. 
The changes, which are subject to public consultation, would scrap a Trump-era rule that had afforded the agency greater discretion to determine the size of whistleblower payouts. 
Critics said that Trump rule deterred whistleblowers since it gave the SEC the discretion in some instances to lower awards. 
The new proposal guarantees that the SEC would consider the dollar amount of a potential award for the ""limited purpose"" of increasing rather than lowering it. 
It would also make it easier for tipsters to claim awards when their information leads to a successful enforcement action brought by other federal agencies, known under the program as a 'related action.' 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that the changes aim to ensure whistleblowers are both incentivized and appropriately rewarded for their efforts in reporting potential violations of the law to the agency.
The SEC's whistleblower program was created by Congress after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and receives thousands of tips annually. 
Currently, the SEC can reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with rewards of between 10% and 30% of the fine. 
The SEC may also pay a reward in a related enforcement action brought by certain other agencies, provided that settlement was based on the same information the tipster originally gave to the SEC. 

The proposed changes to the related action rule would afford tipsters more choice to decide whether to receive an award from the SEC or the authority administering the other award program.

LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union should not have set a time limit on how long clearing houses in Britain can continue serving customers in the bloc, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday.
Bailey told an annual dinner for British financial services lobby TheCityUK that he welcomed this week's EU decision to extend temporary equivalence - allowing EU access for Britain's derivatives clearing houses - by three years to June 2025.
But he said there was no good reason - if the EU was focused on financial stability - for it to set a time limit after which it will automatically deem British rules as no longer being equivalent, thereby ending cross-Channel activity. 
""Maintaining a shared deep commitment to open markets and open financial systems with strong and appropriate regulatory standards and cooperation to support them means that there need be no time limit to this equivalence,"" Bailey said.
Even when Britain was part of the European Union, many EU officials and politicians resented how European companies preferred to clear euro-denominated transactions in London, rather than less international financial centres in the euro zone.
The EU blocked its companies from using a wide range of British financial services after Brexit.
But in the case of euro-denominated clearing, an abrupt end would have disrupted markets given the huge volumes involved and refusal by banks and asset managers to shift the business to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt.
The London Stock Exchange's LCH unit in London clears about 90% of euro interest rate derivatives, a contract widely used by companies in the EU to insure themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
The EU agreed on Tuesday to prolong until June 30, 2025 permission for Britain's clearing houses to continue serving customers in the bloc, but officials said it would be the final extension.

Bailey said global frameworks were a better way to ensure financial stability rather than regional silos.
""Seeking to fragment the international system cannot be justified in light of the success of the post financial crisis approach,"" he said.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 01:00PM ET</span>","Tesla recalls over 500,000 U.S. vehicles to fix pedestrian warning sounds","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is recalling 578,607 vehicles in the United States because pedestrians may not be able to hear a required warning sound of an approaching car due to loud music or other sounds played by its ""Boombox"" feature, a U.S. regulator said on Thursday.
Tesla has issued 10 U.S. recalls over the last four months, including four in the last two weeks. The Texas-based company has come under increasing scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Tesla said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the vehicle alert issue that spurred the latest recall.
Tesla is recalling some 2020-2022 Model S, Model X, Model Y, and 2017-2022 Model 3 vehicles because the ""Boombox function"" allows sounds to be played through an external speaker while the vehicle is in motion and that may obscure the required Pedestrian Warning System sound.
NHTSA said they fail to comply with a federal motor vehicle safety standard on minimum sound requirements for electric vehicles.
Tesla will perform an over-the-air software update that will disable the Boombox functionality when the vehicle is in Drive, Neutral and Reverse modes. Many of Tesla's recent recalls have been to address software issues.
Several of Tesla's recent recalls have come soon after NHTSA raised questions about features or complaints. The regulator is investigating Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot and an in-vehicle game feature.
Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla in January 2021 agreed to recall 135,000 vehicles with touchscreen displays that could fail. In that case, NHTSA took the unusual step of formally seeking the recall.
Tesla had sought to resolve that issue with an over the air update but NHTSA said in early 2021 the updates could be ""procedurally and substantively insufficient.""
In the most recent recall, Tesla introduced ""Boombox"" in December 2020, and NHTSA issued an information request in January 2021, the automaker said. There were several virtual meetings on the issue over subsequent months.
In September, NHTSA upgraded an investigation into the issue, Tesla said. In October Tesla defended tests and rationale used to determine Boombox’s compliance but ultimately Tesla agreed to a recall after two days of meetings last month.
Boombox uses the Pedestrian Warning System (PWS) speaker and users can customize sounds.

Electric vehicles are often harder to hear at lower speeds than gasoline-powered engines. Under rules mandated by Congress, automakers must add sounds to electric vehicles when they are moving at speeds of up to 18.6 miles per hour (30 km per hour) to help prevent injuries among pedestrians, cyclists and the blind.
NHTSA has said that at higher speeds, tire noise, wind resistance, and other factors eliminate the need for alert sounds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euronext's integration of Borsa Italiana is reaping savings faster than expected for potential acquisitions, though no ""actionable"" target has been identified, the pan-European exchange's CEO Stephane Boujnah said on Thursday.
Euronext acquired the Milan exchange last year, the latest in a string of bourse acquisitions which has made it Europe's biggest share trading pool, Boujnah said.
Faster-than-anticipated savings and a billion euros in surplus cash means the exchange has more flexibility when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, he added.
""We don't at the current moment have an identified, actionable target,"" Boujnah told Reuters.
Euroclear, the pan-European settlement house in which Euronext has a stake, was not an actionable takeover target, Boujnah told a media call.
Increasing the exchange's presence in environment, social and governance (ESG) or sustainable investing, along with promoting a new tech listing segment, were now top priorities, he said.
Euronext reported fourth quarter 2021 revenue and income of 370 million euros, up 59.5%, lifted by the Borsa acquisition. Operating profit rose to 150.6 million euros, compared with 98.6 million euros in the same quarter of 2020.
Underlying operating costs for 2022 are expected to total around 622 million euros, compared with an annualised fourth quarter of 2021 of 627 million euros, Euronext said.
There were already 10 million euros in annualised savings related to Borsa Italiana and other factors last year, out of a target of 100 million by end 2024, helping to cut Euronext group's overall net debt, the exchange said.
Euronext declined to estimate savings for 2022.
Boujnah reiterated there would be no mandatory layoffs in Milan, with any cuts in staff made on a voluntary basis, and that over time, more resources will end up in Italy.
The exchange expects to pay an annual dividend of 1.93 euros per share for 2021.

Euronext said the relocation of its main server from Basildon, England to Bergamo in Italy by the start of June was on track.
All large and medium sized customers have signed to the new server, along with most of the smaller customers, Boujnah said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Kellogg stock (NYSE:K) traded 3% higher Thursday after the cereal-maker rode price hikes and high demand to beat fourth-quarter estimates and followed that up with a robust outlook.
Record-high prices of crude and farm produce like wheat and corn as well as cooking oils has roiled the commodity markets, hurting packaged food companies.
Demand for its Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes has stayed elevated because of their utility for home-stuck and working-from-home consumers. Price hikes have followed while consumers haven’t really complained, boosting sales.
A 12-week-long labor strike, running through much of the quarter and spread across its four cereal plants in the U.S., eroded operating profit by close to 15%. Supply chain disruptions caused their own damage. As a result, net sales fell 1.3% to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter and the company expects the hurt to linger through June, according to Reuters.
Fourth-quarter sales were also lower because of an extra shipping week in the same period a year ago.
A small fire also occurred at one of the plants in early December.
""After our supply was further disrupted by the fire and strike, we are recovering production, inventory and service levels and commercial programs in that (U.S. cereal) business"", Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Steven Cahillane as saying.
Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was lower by 3 cents at 83 cents but beat estimates.
The company expects current-year organic net sales to grow by around 3%, led by higher prices. Both reported and organic net sales in 2021 topped $14 billion.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>","Bombardier eyes higher business jet deliveries, plane production","By Allison Lampert and Aishwarya Nair
(Reuters) -Canadian business jet maker Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc said on Thursday it would increase production of its strongest-selling aircraft and forecast higher deliveries, after reporting an adjusted quarterly profit.
Business jet makers are ramping up production on higher demand from wealthy travelers opting to fly private during the pandemic, but broader industry supply-chain hiccups, labor shortages and recent surges in COVID-19 cases remain challenges.
Montreal-based Bombardier said this year it expects customers to take more jets than the 120 corporate planes it delivered in 2021, and would raise production of medium and large aircraft, with a focus on its popular Challenger line.
""Looking ahead, we are positioning ourselves to increase the number of deliveries by another 15-20% as soon as 2023, while maintaining a sharp focus on balancing longer-term production increases with the pricing environment,"" said Bombardier Chief Executive Eric Martel in a statement.
Martel later told reporters that while the supply chain issues it faces are ""manageable,"" they generally involve smaller suppliers who are trying to rehire workers laid off during the pandemic.
""When you look at the root cause of those issues it is mainly the smaller suppliers,"" he said.
Martel said a tax on luxury items being drafted by Canada's government affected about a handful of orders, and could impact employment ""at some point,"" although the country remains a small market for Bombardier's jets. 
In 2021, Bombardier generated cash flow of $100 million from continuing operations.
It expects free cash flow to be greater than $50 million in 2022, a forecast Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier describes in a note to clients as ""very conservative."" 
Business jet revenues are forecast to rise to more than $6.5 billion in 2022 from $6 billion in 2021.

The company said it would host a virtual investor day on Feb. 24.
Bombardier reported an adjusted quarterly profit of 3 cents per share, helped by higher aircraft margins and cost reduction efforts. Analysts had expected a loss of 3 cents per share according to data from Refinitiv.

Aareal, which is reeling from a $2.1 billion buyout attempt that failed last week, responded that the issues raised in the letter were ""without merit"".
Teleios is one of the big investors that cheered the bid's demise because it said the deal had undervalued the company. 
The letter https://www.teleioscapital.com/documents/2022-02-10-Teleios-Letter-to-the-Board-of-Aareal.pdf, signed by Adam Epstein of Teleios, is the first detailed reaction from the investor, which has long called for changes at the German real-estate lender.
Management and the supervisory board had backed the offer from the buyout group, which included U.S.-based Advent International and Centerbridge Partners.
The Teleios letter said that the protagonists of the buyout deal, including chair Hermann Wagner, should ""acknowledge their misjudgement and resign now"".
Teleios is the second big investor to call for Wagner's resignation after Petrus Advisers did so last week.
In its response to the letter, Aareal said that some minority shareholders seem to want to break up the bank.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 11:47AM ET</span>",Equinor to adjust Norway offshore wind plans after policy change -executive,"By Nora Buli and Nerijus Adomaitis
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor said on Thursday it must rework its offshore wind plans at home after the government decided that the first such plants can only supply domestic power users and not link up with other countries.
Equinor has teamed up with Germany's RWE and Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY) to bid for ocean acreage to build wind turbines near the maritime border with Denmark, labelled Soerlige Nordsjoe II.
The government on Wednesday announced that the first offshore wind farms to be built in that area will not be allowed to connect to foreign markets via so-called hybrid connections, and that the power can thus only be sent to Norway.
""This is a case that is quite different from the one that we, Norsk Hydro and RWE have been preparing for,"" the head of Equinor's renewable energy business, Paal Eitrheim, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
""Our starting point for Soerlige Nordsjoe II has been to develop a strong business case based on a hybrid type of model,"" he said.
Hybrid cables have become a hot topic in Norway as households and businesses were hit by a spike in power prices. Continued electricity exports, despite low water reservoir levels, are one of the factors for high prices.
Some energy dependent businesses and labour unions have called on the centre-left government to prevent more international power links from being built, including hybrid cables.
As a result of the decision to prevent exports, the initial offshore wind developments could become reliant on government support in order to be built, Labour Party Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Wednesday.
By contrast, if the offshore wind turbines could connect to multiple countries, profitable business models could have been developed without subsidies, Eitrheim said.

""Norway is very high on our agenda, but we also need to make sure that we have the possibility of developing robust business cases, and that we don't know yet,"" he added.
The government has said it will consider allowing a second phase of the Soerlige Nordsjoe II developments to connect to foreign markets.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 11:46AM ET</span>",Explainer-How a German 'climate' fund set out to help Russia dodge U.S. sanctions,"By Thomas Escritt and Sarah Marsh
BERLIN (Reuters) - A German politician set up a state-backed foundation with Russian energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) last year to help Moscow avoid U.S. sanctions on a pipeline due to carry Russian gas to Europe.
The move adds to questions about whether the United States and Germany are on the same page over the $11 billion project – a crucial issue as the two major democracies lead NATO allies in a pushback against Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
In 2019, Washington imposed sanctions on those involved in laying the pipeline, Nord Stream 2. The United States has argued that the line, which is built but is not yet pumping gas, is a tool for Russia to support aggression against Ukraine. 
A major pipeline from Russia to Europe currently crosses Ukraine, but Nord Stream 2 runs direct to Germany under the Baltic Sea. By enabling Russia to cut Ukraine out of Europe's energy supply, Washington says the pipe will weaken Kyiv and make it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.
Germany rejects the U.S. sanctions, saying Nord Stream 2 is primarily a commercial project that diversifies energy supplies for Europe. Senior German politicians from both main parties have said the U.S. objections are self-interested: Washington wants to sell Germany more gas. 
Russia has repeatedly said that the project is commercial, not political, it would help alleviate power shortages in Europe and bring down gas prices; it says the sanctions are unfair and serve as a tool against competitors.
Despite the sanctions, the line was completed in 2021. 
By December, Moscow had amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders. It denies it is planning an invasion. U.S. officials say an attack could occur within days or weeks.
What is the foundation?
The Klima- und Umweltschutz (Climate and Environment Protection Foundation) was set up in January 2021, when the pipeline was virtually complete, by the government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the east German region where Nord Stream 2 makes landfall. An initiative of Social Democrat state premier Manuela Schwesig, the Foundation says it will boost the role of renewables, and gas as a bridging technology towards cleaner fuels. 
Where did the money come from?
The regional government injected 200,000 euros ($230,000) into the Foundation, according to the region's public audit office. The Foundation was also endowed with 20 million euros from Nord Stream 2 AG, a Switzerland-based company owned by Gazprom PAO, according to a company spokesperson.
Nord Stream 2 said it would give the Foundation a further 2 million euros each year. Any profits made by the commercial arm will also go to the Foundation's endowment, according to its charter. 
What does the Foundation do?
It is a philanthropic fund that supports environmental projects, which according to its statutes also has a commercial arm. The commercial arm carries out its activities related to Nord Stream 2.
Its website lists environmental projects it has supported: For example, it says it offers every kindergarten in the state a free tree for children to plant plus 500 euros, and runs competitions for children to think up ways of making schools more climate-friendly, promising grants to the winners.
Its charter says the Foundation's secondary goal is to make sure the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completed, ""regardless of external efforts.""
The Foundation can acquire, manage, own, provide or let land, tools and machines that help it fulfill either goal, including the completion of the pipeline, the charter says.
""We believe that it is right to build the pipeline,"" Schwesig told reporters in January 2021.
She and others have argued that Germany needs a source of energy which does not depend on good will between Russia and Ukraine. Advocating for the pipeline in the state parliament last January, Schwesig said the U.S. sanctions were self-interested. 
""Nobody who is working on building the pipeline is doing anything wrong,"" she said. ""The ones doing something wrong are those who are trying to stop the pipeline at the last minute ... That's why we expect our Federal Government to push back firmly against the sanctions.""
Former Finance Minister Olaf Scholz - now Chancellor - has rejected the U.S. sanctions as interference in Germany's affairs.
Who else backs the Foundation?
Schwesig's Social Democrat Party (SPD), which leads Germany's governing coalition and has traditionally advocated for close relations with Russia, is the bedrock of political support for the foundation, but a politician from the opposition Christian Democrats also serves on its board – reflecting broad public backing for Nord Stream 2 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The Foundation's president is SPD member Erwin Sellering, a past state premier. Gerhard Schroeder, a former SPD Chancellor and close friend of Putin's, has headed the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream since 2005. He is also on the board of Russia's top oil producer Rosneft, and this month was nominated to join Gazprom's board of directors. Schroeder declined to comment to Reuters.
What benefits will Germany get from the pipeline?
The pipeline would double the amount of gas Russia can pump directly to Germany. Russian natural gas accounts for around half of Germany's gas needs. Gas keeps half of Germany's households warm and is key for manufacturing industries like ceramics in Europe's largest economy. Gas accounted for just over 15% of German electricity generation last year, according to the energy and water industry group BDEW.
What has the Foundation done to help the pipeline get built?
It declined to answer the question.
In an account of its first year on its website, it said that to complete the pipeline, ""the U.S.'s illegal threats had to be countered with a wide range of measures, which for obvious reasons cannot be made the subject of public explanation.""
The commercial arm, which carries out its activities related to the pipeline, is headed by a person appointed by Nord Stream 2, according to The Foundation's statute. The Foundation declined to tell Reuters whom Nord Stream 2 had appointed to head the commercial arm.
Public records show the foundation owns the Blue Ship, a general cargo vessel built in 2006 sailing under Cypriot flag. Stationed in the Russian port of Murmansk for much of 2020, the vessel entered the Baltic on July 1 last year, and has remained near the port of Mukran, some 30 km (18 miles) from the pipeline's landing point of Lubmin ever since. No other ships are registered to the foundation.
A U.S. State Department report to Congress last November said the Blue Ship was one of two vessels that had engaged in pipe-laying activities, on Nord Stream 2 or another sanctioned project. 
The Blue Ship was not sanctioned, however. The State Department said the ship's owner was exempt from sanctions. A 2021 bill enacting the sanctions stated that European Union governments were excluded, as well as EU governments that were not operating as a business. The State Department did not elaborate.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration waived some sanctions on Nord Stream 2 in May 2021 as Washington sought to rebuild ties with Germany, after relations deteriorated under former President Donald Trump. 
How does the local area benefit from the pipeline?
Several hundred local workers were involved in building it, ""several hundred million euros"" have been invested in the state so far in relation to Nord Stream 2, and the pipeline operator expects to employ around 30 workers long-term, a spokesman for Gas for Europe (G4E), the German subsidiary of Nord Stream 2, told Reuters. 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern houses much of Germany's offshore wind capacity and the local government says it aims to use wind power to produce ""green"" hydrogen that can in future be exported through the Nord Stream 2 line. 
What does the rest of Germany say about the Foundation?
The foreign ministry declined to comment on the Foundation or its goals. Former Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who was in office when the Foundation was set up, said at the time it was ""a decision made in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, it was not a decision of the federal government."" 
The region's public audit office has criticised the Foundation. In a statement to Reuters, the office said the state had only given it partial information about the Foundation, had done so late, and the public money the state had given to the Foundation was no longer under the state's control. 
Some environmentalists argue that supporting gas is harmful to the climate, noting that gas emits carbon when burned. German NGO Environment Aid has called the Foundation ""a service to Nord Stream 2 AG."" 
What does the Foundation say about the Ukraine crisis?
Its president Sellering told Reuters the crisis is being used as an excuse by ""significant forces"" in the United States and Germany who have always been opposed to the pipeline, and who now, ""in advance of and independent of any actions by Russia, are trying to bring about an end to Nord Stream 2."" 
He said it would be unfair if Germany were made to stop importing Russian gas while the United States continued to import raw materials from Russia.

If fresh sanctions are imposed on the pipeline, will the Foundation act to blunt their impact?
The Foundation did not respond to this question.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 11:46AM ET</span>",Unilever expects new Ben & Jerry's 'arrangement' for Israel by year-end,"By Richa Naidu and Ross Kerber
LONDON / BOSTON (Reuters) - The board of Ben & Jerry's aims to work out a ""new arrangement"" for sales in Israel before the end of the year, Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC's CEO said on Thursday, after the U.S.-based independent ice cream brand last year committed to halting sales in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
""Our absolute focus right now is to figure out what the new arrangement will be for Ben & Jerry's,"" CEO Alan Jope said on a conference call with journalists after the company announced earnings.
Jope's comments were the most specific he has given about the actions of the ice cream brand, which is based in the state of Vermont. Ben & Jerry's said in July that it would halt sales in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, sparking backlash including divestments by some U.S. pension funds.
Ben & Jerry's, which has its own quasi-independent board under the terms of its 2000 purchase by Unilever, said it was ""inconsistent with our values"" for its product to be sold in those areas. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
Ben & Jerry's often speaks up on political and social questions. For example, on Feb. 3 the brand said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) the decision of U.S. President Joe Biden to send troops to Europe ""in response to Russia's threats against Ukraine only fans the flame of war.""
Jope did not directly criticize Ben & Jerry's activism. But he said: ""On subjects where Unilever brands don't have the expertise or credibility, we think it's best that they stay out of the debate."" 
""Ben & Jerry's is a great brand - most of the time they get it right - they have a great track record of campaigning on important issues that are relevant to their consumers,"" Jope added.
Investors are watching the ice cream controversy as a test of Jope's ability to balance his emphasis on marketing tied to social issues with financial results.
Speaking before Jope's remarks, Kevin Dreyer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, whose parent GAMCO owns about 225,000 Unilever shares, said that while many Unilever consumers like its green-labeled products, some political activism by Unilever's brands could alienate some consumers.
Jope has previously said Ben & Jerry's board acted independently and that Unilever does not support efforts to isolate Israeli, where it employs nearly 2,000 people. Ben & Jerry's had said it would continue to sell ice cream in Israel ""through a different arrangement.""
""We're a values-led company with a long history of advocating for human rights, and economic and social justice,"" Ben & Jerry's said in July when it announced its sales halt plans.
Ben & Jerry's accounts for about 3% of the world's ice cream market. The brand's sales grew 9% last year, Unilever said, outpacing overall underlying sales growth of 4.5%. The company did not give further details on sales.

""I definitely would not make a connection between those (Ben & Jerry's) statements and its sales growth,"" Jope said on the call. 
""The growth that we're seeing on Ben & Jerry's is driven much more by their innovation programme,"" Jope added.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Macellum Advisors GP LLC said on Thursday that it is seeking to take control of retailer Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS)'s board and has nominated 10 directors.
Macellum, led by Jonathan Duskin, has criticized Kohl's for not doing enough to improve its business and has publicly called for the company to consider putting itself up for sale.
He also criticized the company for rejecting two takeover offers and for having adopted a defense tactic to prevent a hostile takeover.
""Any directors that support such patently anti-shareholder maneuvers cannot be trusted to credibly evaluate potentially value-maximizing alternatives versus management's perpetually ineffective plans,"" he wrote in a letter that details the nominations.
Kohl's said ""Macellum's effort to take control of the board is unjustified and counterproductive"" and called the hedge fund's claim that the board isn't able to review sales opportunities ""groundless."" It also said Macellum's comments on the shareholder rights plan, also called a poison pill, are ""misleading.""
Duskin has said privately that Kohl's 14-member board is too large and too entrenched to make the changes needed to push up the company's lagging share price. He also said that the company needs to have a shareholder on the board and he nominated himself along with nine others with expertise in retail and investment banking.
""Given the growing list of issues and red flags in the boardroom, we believe substantial and urgent change is needed,"" Duskin wrote.
This marks the second time that Macellum has nominated directors at Kohl's after it was part of a consortium that sought to replace nine board members last year.
The investors agreed to drop that challenge when Kohl's expanded its 11-member board by three directors in 2021.

Reuters reported in December that Macellum was planning to nominate directors and in January that the firm was pressing Kohl's for at least one board seat and a public statement that the company is reviewing strategic alternatives. 
Last week, Kohl's rebuffed two takeover offers that would have valued the company at roughly $9 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will build at least six new nuclear reactors in the decades to come, President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, placing nuclear power at the heart of his country's drive for carbon neutrality by 2050.
Macron said the new plants would be built and operated by state-controlled energy provider EDF (PA:EDF) and that tens of billions of euros in public financing would be mobilized to finance the projects and safeguard EDF's finances. 
""What our country needs, and the conditions are there, is the rebirth of France's nuclear industry,"" Macron said, unveiling his new nuclear strategy in the eastern industrial town of Belfort.
Promising to accelerate the development of solar and offshore wind power Macron also said he wanted to extend the lifespan of older nuclear plants in the world’s most nuclear-intensive country to more than 50 years from more than 40 years currently for certain reactors, provided it was safe.
The announcement comes at a difficult time for debt-laden EDF, which is facing delays and budget over-runs on new nuclear plants in France and Britain, and corrosion problems in some of its ageing reactors. 
The nuclear blueprint cements France's commitment to nuclear power, a mainstay of the country's postwar industrial prowess but whose future was uncertain after Macron and his predecessor had promised to reduce its weight in the country's energy mix.
Macron's thinking has been reshaped by the European Union’s ambitious goals for carbon neutrality within three decades, which put renewed focus on energy forms that emit fewer, or zero, greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, including nuclear.
Surging energy prices and concerns about Europe's reliance on imported Russian gas have also persuaded French officials of the region's need for more energy independence.
EDF estimates the cost of six new reactors at about 50 billion euros ($57.36 billion), depending on financing conditions.
The first new reactor, an evolution of the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), would come online by 2035, Macron said. Studies for a further eight reactors beyond the initial half-dozen new plants would be launched, he added.
France will also increase its solar power capacity tenfold by 2050 to more than 100 gigawatts (GW) and target building 50 offshore wind farms with a combined capacity of at least 40 GW. 
ENERGY U-TURN
Macron's decision to extend the lifespan of existing plants marked a U-turn on an earlier pledge to close more than a dozen of EDF's 56 reactors by 2035. 
Nuclear safety still divides Europe after Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. 
""Certain countries have made the extreme choice of turning their back on nuclear energy. France has not made that choice,"" Macron said.
Green energy campaign group Association negaWatt accused Macron of ""deepening France's addiction"" to nuclear.
France lobbied hard for nuclear to be labelled as sustainable under new European Commission rules on green financing. 
If the new EU taxonomy rules are approved, it should reduce the cost of financing nuclear energy projects.
Macron said the state would assume its responsibilities in securing EDF's finances, indicating that the government may inject fresh capital into the 84% state-owned firm. 
The state will assume its responsibilities in securing EDF's finances and its short- and medium-term financing capacity,"" Macron said. 
EDF's EPR reactors have suffered a troubled history. EPR projects at Flamanville in France and Hinkley Point in Britain are running years behind schedule and billions over budget, while EPR reactors in China and Finland have been hit by technical issues. 
Separately, EDF this week revised lower its output forecast for its nuclear fleet to 295-315 TWh compared with 361 TWh last year, in part due to extended reactor shutdowns due to corrosion problems in several reactors. If the level drops below 300 TWh, it would be at its lowest since 1990. 
Compounding EDF's difficulties, Macron, who faces a re-election battle in two months and is striving to head off public anger over rising energy bills, has ordered the utility to sell more cheap power to rivals – a move that is will knock about 8 billion euros off EDF's 2022 core earnings.
EDF's share price is down 18% so far in 2022. 

EDF confirmed on Thursday it would buy a France-based nuclear turbine unit from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) as the utility looks to bundle nuclear activities deemed to be strategic.

HOUSTON/PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama's government expects to receive soon a proposal by mining firm First Quantum Minerals (OTC:FQVLF) to convert a coal-fired power plant to cleaner energy, Energy Minister Jorge Rivera told Reuters on Wednesday. 
A unit of the Canadian miner last month agreed to pay higher royalties to Panama as part of contract renegotiations for a flagship copper project. The government now wants the company to cease the use of coal at Panama's only plant left that still burns the fuel for power generation. 
The plant conversion could be a milestone in a clean energy plan that Rivera said is on track to cease the use of bunker and coal for power generation by December 2023.
The new contract with First Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) has yet to be approved by Panama's Congress and must be signed by both parties. According to negotiated terms, the miner must start technical studies six months after the contract signing. The goal is to implement cleaner energy technologies to replace burning coal at an existing power plant, the energy ministry said. 
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry will participate in the fifth ministerial meeting of the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) this week in Panama, which will focus on the transition to cleaner fuels.
""Our concept is that energy transition must be fair and inclusive, not only focused on the technological aspect,"" Rivera said.
A global reshuffle of energy supplies this year has cut demand for transit of liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels through the Panama Canal, with ships making u-turns to Europe from Asia, the waterway's authority said on Wednesday.
But the Canal is facing higher seasonal demand for transit, handling the passage of about 39 ships per day, it said.
KICKING OFF
Another piece of Panama's clean energy agenda is a natural gas-fueled 670-megawatt power plant near Colon, a $1 billion project by a consortium between InterEnergy Group, a unit of AES (NYSE:AES), and the government. The plant began construction last month.
""The plant should start operations between December 2023 and April 2024. That is why we are preparing the decommissioning of other plants by the end of 2023,"" Rivera said. 
Panama, which last year produced 82% of its electricity from renewable sources, is upgrading its legal framework and running price forecasts to encourage cleaner energy sources, including the production of sugarcane-based ethanol and the installation of decentralized power generation plants.
The government also plans to call consulting companies this month for advice on reforming Panama's hydrocarbon law, aimed at updating regulations for downstream projects, the minister said.

(Reuters) - A California civil rights agency said it filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc of failing for years to address widespread racist conduct at its Fremont assembly plant.
Tesla has said it does not tolerate discrimination and has taken steps to address complaints by workers. 
The lawsuit is not the first time that such allegations have been made against the electric car maker and the following is a look at where several similar cases stand:
* In October, a federal jury ordered Tesla to pay $137 million to Owen Diaz, a Black former employee who said managers at the Fremont plant ignored his complaints about constant racial harassment. A judge is considering Tesla's bid for a new trial or to lower the award, which is one of the largest in a discrimination lawsuit by a single worker.
* A few months before the verdict in the Diaz case, an arbitrator awarded former Tesla employee Melvin Berry $1 million in a race-bias case. Berry claimed he was called the ""N-word"" and that he was given undesirable jobs and hours after he complained. 
* The company is also facing similar claims of tolerating racist conduct in a proposed class action lawsuit in California state court. A judge last year rejected Tesla's bid to dismiss the class-action claims.

* On Feb. 1 Tesla was sued by Kaylen Barker, a gay Black former employee who says she was harassed and physically assaulted by a coworker at a smaller plant in Lathrop, California. Barker in her complaint said Black Tesla workers are ""forced to step back in time and suffer painful abuses reminiscent of the Jim Crow era.""
* Tesla is also facing at least eight lawsuits filed since November by female employees who say they have endured rampant sexual harassment at the Fremont plant and were retaliated against for complaining. The plaintiffs claim they were subjected to catcalls, sexist language and inappropriate touching by coworkers and managers.

(Reuters) -Cereal maker Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co forecast full-year profit growth above market expectations on Thursday, riding on higher product prices that helped overcome labor strike disruptions and soaring input costs in the fourth quarter.
Increasing costs for freight and ingredients such as wheat, corn and edible oils due to global supply chain snarls have significantly hurt packaged food companies, leaving them with little choice but to hike prices. 
Kellogg said the nearly three-month strike that started in October at its U.S. cereal plants hit margins in the fourth quarter, as it hired temporary workers at higher wages, and would affect sales in the first half this year.
A small fire also occurred at one of the plants in early December.
""After our supply was further disrupted by the fire and strike, we are recovering production, inventory and service levels and commercial programs in that (U.S. cereal) business"", Chief Executive Officer Steven Cahillane said on a call with analysts.
Kellogg, however, expects adjusted full-year profit per share to grow by 1% to 2% on a currency-neutral basis thanks to increased prices for its breakfast cereals and snacks such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles. Analysts on average expected a 0.1% rise, according to Refintiv IBES data. 
The company said its forecast accounted for further inflationary pressures and the impact of the workers' strike.
Shares of the Michigan-based company rose about 3.5% in morning trading.
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter fell to 30.2% from 34.2% a year earlier, while net income attributable to Kellogg more than doubled to $433 million, or $1.26 per share.

Excluding items, Kellogg earned 83 cents per share, edging past estimates of 79 cents.
Net sales fell to $3.42 billion in the quarter but beat the consensus estimate of $3.39 billion.

(Reuters) -The world's top two cola makers, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), on Thursday warned of pressure on profits this year from a relentless rise in costs after trouncing sales expectations on robust demand and price increases.
Costs from aluminum cans to labor and shipping have surged in the last year due to pandemic-induced global supply-chain disruptions, forcing companies across the packaged food industry to respond with price hikes.
However, with costs still rising and supply bottlenecks showing little signs of easing, analysts caution that the price hikes will likely not be enough to fully cushion the industry's profit margins.
PepsiCo finance chief Hugh Johnston told Reuters the company could potentially raise prices further later in the year if costs climb more than expected, and did not rule out some product shortages.
""We control our supply chain basically all the way to the shelf. That puts us in a relatively better position, but I wouldn't say we're not going to have challenges. We're not immune to that,"" Johnston said.
The company's arch rival from Atlanta echoed a similar sentiment.
""Is it likely to be perfect this year? No, but we are doing the maximum we can to optimize our full availability,"" Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on an analyst call.
Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin fell to 22.1% from 27.3% a year earlier. PepsiCo's adjusted operating margin shrank 183 basis points.
PepsiCo expects fiscal 2022 core earnings of $6.67 per share, below analysts' expectations of $6.73, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Coca-Cola forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share to increase 5% to 6% from $2.32 in 2021, compared with estimates of a 6% rise.
Still, analysts were largely positive on the results. 

""The current impact on margins doesn't change our long-term outlook for Coke and Pepsi simply because eventually inflation should subside and the changes that both these companies have made internally should begin to shine through,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 
PepsiCo's fourth-quarter net revenue rose 12.4% to $25.25 billion, while Coca-Cola's adjusted revenue rose 10.1% to $9.47 billion.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly advertising revenue and user growth on Thursday and forecast revenue short of Wall Street targets, indicating that its turnaround plan has yet to bear fruit.
Still, the social networking site said it made ""meaningful progress"" toward its goal of reaching 315 million users and $7.5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2023, and said user growth should accelerate in the United States and internationally this year.
Shares of the San Francisco-based company rose more than 8% after the results, but pared those gains in morning trading. 
Twitter has been pursuing big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters to end long-running stagnation and attract new users and advertisers. But the quarterly results raised questions about Twitter's plan as analysts had expected faster signs of progress.
Monetizable daily active users, or users who see ads, grew 13% to 217 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, missing consensus estimates of 218.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That was up from 211 million users in the previous quarter.
Twitter also announced a new $4 billion share repurchase program, which replaces a $2 billion program from 2020.
""Twitter's stock buyback plan is helping investors overlook the company's relatively weak results and outlook,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. 
Advertising revenue for the fourth quarter grew 22% year over year to $1.41 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $1.43 billion.
Twitter gained 6 million users during the quarter, but will need to add over 12 million each quarter over the next two years to hit its target of 315 million people by the end of 2023, said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, calling it ""an incredibly lofty goal."" 
The quarterly results are the first since Chief Executive Parag Agrawal took the helm in November. His appointment, after co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO, signaled an increased focus on engineering and incorporating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.
During an earnings call with analysts, Agrawal said he was focused on faster decision-making and a ""focus on doing fewer things.""
""I see a strong urgency to improve our focus and execution but also a lot of confidence in our strategy and our team,"" he said.
BOOSTING USER ACTIVITY
The company forecast first-quarter total revenue of $1.17 billion to $1.27 billion. The mid-point of that range is below Wall Street's average target of $1.26 billion.
Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said in an interview that user growth was in line with Twitter's guidance in the previous quarter, and that Twitter was working to boost user activity by prompting people to follow topics they are interested in during the sign-up process.
He added that advertising demand was not as strong in the last few weeks of the fourth quarter as it had been during the beginning of the holiday season.
Total ad engagements, which include clicks, decreased 12% during the quarter. That was due in part to a shift toward video ads and other formats that generally receive less engagement from users but are more expensive, and profitable, for Twitter. The cost of each ad engagement rose 39%.
The company said the impact from privacy changes by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) remained modest. Last year, Apple began requiring apps to receive permission from iOS users to track their activity on apps and websites owned by other companies.
The Apple changes could impact Twitter in the future as it grows its performance advertising business, Segal said, referring to ads that seek to drive sales or other consumer actions. He said Twitter is working to mitigate future negative impacts from Apple's changes.
""We're pleased with the progress we've made, but we have more work to do here,"" he said.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc last week blamed the Apple changes for hurting advertisers' ability to target and measure ads, and said it could have a $10 billion impact on Meta's advertising business this year.

Twitter reported that fourth-quarter total revenue, which also includes money earned from data licensing, rose 22% to $1.57 billion, in line with analyst estimates.
Full-year 2022 revenue is expected to grow in the low-to-mid-20% range. Total cost and expenses for 2022 are expected to grow in the mid-20% range versus last year, the company said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Mattel stock (NASDAQ:MAT) surged 10% Thursday after the company forecast strong business momentum for the current year and the next, pinning its hopes on the pandemic-fueled demand for toys sustaining and growing.
“We are in growth mode and believe we are well-positioned to continue our momentum, with 2022 guidance exceeding prior goals and an even stronger outlook for 2023,” Chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a statement.
Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 10% to $1.8 billion, riding the demand for its Barbie and Polly Pocket dolls, action figures and building sets. Demand for toys got an unexpected boost from the pandemic when home-struck parents ordered toys for their children to engage with. They were willing to pay more, allowing the company to beat estimates every quarter despite cost pressures.
""We are not necessarily expecting supply chain disruptions to go away, but we do expect to be able to navigate further disruption if it comes,"" Reuters quoted Kreiz as saying.
Adjusted profit per share rose by 13 cents to 53 cents and beat estimates comfortably.
Mattel is now projecting its 2021 net sales of $5.4 billion to grow 8% to 10% in the current year. Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.42 to $1.48. The toymaker also lifted its 2023 net sales growth forecast to high-single-digit from a previous outlook of mid-single-digit growth.
Late January, Mattel regained the license to produce Cinderella, Frozen doll characters including Elsa and Anna and other toys based on Disney’s princess lineup. It had lost the license to its bigger rival Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) in 2016. The company will start selling new  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) toys in 2023.

Pandemic winners and high-flying tech companies, such as exercise bike maker Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/peloton-names-former-netflix-exec-mccarthy-new-ceo-after-foley-exits-wsj-2022-02-08, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-stayhome-stocks-2022-01-21 and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-forecasts-q1-revenue-below-estimates-2022-02-02 have been punished in the opening weeks of 2022 as investors, faced with volatile markets and the prospect of interest rate rises, churn portfolios. 
""There has been a pretty sharp rotation in those kind of names...the appetite is for investors to sell shares if earnings are getting mixed,"" said one London-based capital markets banker.
Delivery Hero shares were close to session lows by 1405 GMT, down 30% to erase 4.7 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in market capitalisation and on track for their worst day since the firm went public in 2017. 
They are now down almost 50% so far in 2022, reversing all their pandemic-era gains, part of a broader trend that has, for example, seen a work from home ETF fall nearly 10% in the first six weeks of the year compared to a 1% fall in the broader U.S. stock market.
Delivery Hero has invested heavily amid a boost in orders during the pandemic, as it seeks to keep rivals at bay in an increasingly competitive e-commerce space.
It said on Thursday it still expects its core food delivery business to break even for the first time in the second half of 2022, and gave revenue guidance of 9.5 billion-10.5 billion euros for 2022, up from 6.6 billion euros in 2021.
However it forecast an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation/gross merchandise value (EBITDA/GMV) margin of around -1.0% to -1.2% for the full year compared to -0.9% forecast by analysts. 
SKEWED
The share price reaction to the earnings of European companies has been negatively skewed so far this season, especially for growth stocks,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said this week. 
According to the U.S. bank, the median growth stock that has missed on profit expectations has fallen by 3.7% on the reporting day against at 0.8% drop for value stocks that have missed. 
Ahead of Delivery Hero's earnings release, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts had sounded upbeat, saying they expected it to ""provide support to our constructive stance"" adding that the firm was among the European Internet stocks with the best risk/reward profile for investors. 
While Citi said it expected some initial share price weakness, UBS analysts said: ""We expect (the company's) profitability comments to be taken well with reassurance coming there, but that positive view is likely to be offset by the q (quick)-commerce losses"". 
Delivery Hero Chief Executive Niklas Oestberg told a media call the company would update its outlook after completing the acquisition of Spanish startup Glovo, expected in the second quarter.

It said it expected Glovo to make an adjusted EBITDA of negative 330 million euros this year, which JPMorgan noted was 100 million euros above their own estimate.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower on Thursday after a new 40-year record high for U.S. inflation stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates repeatedly this year. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 281 points, or 0.8% at 35,487 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite, which has traded more sensitively to interest rate expectations in recent weeks, was down 1.5%.
Earlier, official statistics showed the consumer price index rose 0.6% on the month and 7.5% on the year, its highest since 1982. The rise in prices was broad-based, with the majority of sub-categories for various goods and services showing an inflation rate of over 5%.
""It isn't just the rate that should be worrying the Federal Reserve, but also the breadth of corporate pricing power,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, in a note to clients.
The labor market, too, showed further signs of having ridden out disruptions from the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 quickly, with initial jobless claims falling by more than expected last week to 223,000.
However, the market trimmed its losses later, on the perception that the numbers, while bad, won't be bad enough to lead the Fed to raise the target rate for Fed Funds by 50 basis points next month, as some have suggested. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester - one of the voting members of the Federal Open Markets Committee this year -  had said on Wednesday that she didn't see a ""compelling reason"" for such a step.
The figures were a disappointment to the bond market too, pushing yields (which move inversely to prices) at the long end of the curve up by around 5-6 basis points. The benchmark 10-Year Treasury note yield, which had fallen on Wednesday after a well-received auction, rose to 2.00% for the first time since August 2019.
The selling wasn't so indiscriminate as to stand in the way of those companies who reported strong earnings overnight or before the opening, however. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock rose 9.1% and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) stock rose by 12.2% after well-received updates, while Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock also rose by  5.1% to its highest in a month after the entertainment giant said it gained 11.8 million new subscribers for its Disney+ service in the holiday quarter. That came at a cost, however, with the unit that houses the streaming service losing nearly $600 million in the quarter. The losses were bankrolled largely by the company's theme park division, which was able to operate almost completely without Covid restrictions in the quarter.
Uber stock was another gainer, after its latest quarterly numbers showed sustained strong revenue growth in its food delivery business despite the reopening of restaurants, while its passenger numbers also increased. The company's forecasts for the current quarter were below consensus forecasts, however. Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 5.1% to a one-month high.

The German group earlier cited a decline in customer call-offs in the period, caused by an ongoing shortage of crucial semiconductors, as the main driver behind a 65% decline in first-quarter adjusted operating profit at the division.
""We saw huge effects ... in our Q1. So we have these call offs which were not stable ... But we also said that we consider this Q1 the worst point,"" Keysberg told analysts after presenting first-quarter results.

""And what we actually see is that we saw a normalisation on a low level in call-offs from automotive customers. But we think it is going to increase,"" he said.
Keysberg said that he expects the semiconductor shortage to continue until the summer, but that the group was observing slightly increasing momentum.

(Reuters) - YouTube on Thursday elaborated on its blockchain and metaverse plans for 2022, saying it could harness the emerging technologies to cut fraud in the fast-growing digital art market and offer a more social viewing experience for gaming content.
The world's largest streaming service, which is owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, over the past year has sought to hang onto users with better guidance about upcoming features amid increasing competition with ByteDance Inc's TikTok and Meta Platforms Inc's Instagram. 
Last month, YouTube said it was exploring what proponents call Web3 technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are video clips, art or other digital assets tied to the record-keeping technology blockchain.
YouTube went further in a blog post on Thursday, suggesting that it could make NFTs safer bets. 
Sales of NFTs soared last year, but critics have said scams, copyright theft and other predatory behavior are too common.
Offering ways to verify the legitimacy of assets using its video library would be one feature possibility, YouTube said.
""Giving a verifiable way for fans to own unique videos, photos, art, and even experiences from their favorite creators could be a compelling prospect for creators and their audience,"" the blog said.
YouTube also has prioritized the metaverse, an element of the Web3 movement that describes shared virtual worlds where people typically interact through avatars.

YouTube said it did not have firm ideas yet but one possibility would be allowing users to watch videos together in a metaverse. Generally, it will focus for now on videos related to ""gaming, where we'll work to bring more interactions to games and make them feel more alive,"" the blog said.
ByteDance last month launched a mobile app for gathering in a metaverse, and Meta is spending billions of dollars on virtual and augmented reality technology.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s bonus pool fell 32% in 2021, the bank said on Thursday, as the bank slashed regular deferred awards following a string of scandals, but senior bankers' pay was sweetened by a surge in upfront cash and a one-off bonus.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank said it had cut its overall variable compensation pool to 2 billion Swiss francs in 2021, as the bank reported a 1.6 billion franc loss for the year.
That reflected the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British finance firm Greensill and a $5.5 billion trading loss from the implosion of the Archegos investment fund.
However, senior bankers, who the bank said had ""taken a higher proportionate share of the reduction in the variable compensation pool"", received 799 million Swiss francs ($865 million) in upfront cash awards, presentation slides showed.
That is up from just 59 million francs granted in upfront cash in 2020, the slides showed.
""Most employees at a more senior level...have received a cash award with a pro-rata repayment (clawback) provision that applies in the event that they voluntarily leave the firm during the three-year period ending in February 2025,"" the bank said in a statement.
Reuters last month reported on the bank's plan to boost cash payouts for senior bankers, as Credit Suisse tries to retain top performers after a horrendous year.
The bank increased the cash portion of short-term bonuses senior staff receive and reduced the amount they get in shares that vest after one year.
It said on Thursday most senior employees were also receiving a separate one-time share-based award that would vest in three years' time if the bank achieves financial goals over the 2022-2024 period. 
That would total 497 million Swiss francs, the bank said in a presentation.
Further details would be provided in its annual report in March, it added.

The bank said it expected higher compensation costs overall in 2022, as CEO Thomas Gottstein said it would need to remain competitive on pay to retain and attract top talent.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The parent company of India's ShareChat has acquired local rival MX's short-video platform in a roughly $700 million deal, two sources told Reuters, as competition heats up in the sector where foreign investors have placed major bets.
The two companies confirmed the deal in a statement but did not disclose financials. Reuters was first to report earlier on Thursday that the two companies had reached a deal.
Indian short-video apps have become popular since New Delhi banned ByteDance's TikTok and some other Chinese apps in 2020 following an India-China border clash. After TikTok was banned, ShareChat's parent entity, Mohalla Tech, launched a similar short-video sharing app named Moj, which counts Meta Platforms Inc's Instagram Reels as its key rival.
In a cash-and-stock deal, ShareChat's parent entity acquired MX's short-video platform called TakaTak, the sources familiar with the transaction said. The deal is valued at around $700 million, said one of the sources. 
In their statement, the companies said the two platforms together will have more than 300 million monthly users and nearly 250 billion monthly video views, creating what they dubbed as ""the largest short video platform for Indians.""

ShareChat is valued at roughly $4 billion and counts Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) among its investors. 
ShareChat has plans to deepen its use of artificial intelligence tools and reach a much wider audience as Moj has roughly 160 million users in India, while MX has roughly 100 million, said one of the sources.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Coca-Cola stock (NYSE:KO) rose 1.4% in premarket Thursday after the beverage giant used price hikes and strong consumer demand to beat fourth-quarter estimates.
Reopening of theatres, parks and entertainment centers enabled a 10% year-on-year jump in quarterly revenue to $9.5 billion, despite the quarter having six fewer days in the company’s books. The company said it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was ahead of 2019 numbers. Concentrate sales fell 1%.
Price were 10% higher while volumes rose 9%. Adjusted operating margin took a hit of 5.2 percentage points to 22.1% because of higher marketing costs. Six fewer days of operations in the quarter put pressure on the topline and also hurt margins.
The company claimed higher value share in the total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage market.
Growth in developing and emerging markets was led by China, India and Russia, while U.S., Mexico and U.K. dominated the growth in developed markets.
The company expects adjusted organic revenue to grow 7%-8% compared to 16% growth in 2021.
Coca-Cola returned $7.3 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends while not repurchasing any share under an existing $10 billion program. It didn’t declare any new dividend.
Compared to that, rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has raised its dividend by 7% while revealing a new $10 billion repurchase program. The Frito Lay-maker returned $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and repurchases."

Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on Thursday the fine would be determined during an administrative investigation, adding Google's conduct had infringed users' interests and restricted competition. 
""Google is waiting for the full text of the decision in order to examine it,"" the company, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said. 
Russia has handed Google several small fines in the last year for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal, part of a wider campaign critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet.
It upped the ante in December by imposing a 7.2 billion roubles ($97 million) penalty for what it said was a persistent failure to remove banned items. Google has appealed that ruling.
""(The FAS) found that the rules related to creating, suspending and blocking accounts and handling of user content on YouTube were non-transparent, biased and unpredictable,"" the FAS said in a statement. 
YouTube was also the subject of a protracted dispute with Tsargrad TV, a Christian Orthodox channel, which Google blocked as the account was owned by a Russian businessman targeted by U.S. sanctions. 
Konstantin Malofeev claimed victory in that case in December, saying Google faced a potentially heavy fine.

YouTube also drew Moscow's ire for taking down a live stream of Russian broadcaster RT DE last year, part of a wider spat that saw Russia shut down German broadcaster Deutsche Welle's operations in Moscow earlier this month and strip its staff of their accreditation.

PARIS (Reuters) - Google Analytics, the world's most widely used web analytics service developed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, risks giving U.S. intelligence services access to French website users' data, France's watchdog CNIL said on Thursday. 
In a decision targeting an unnamed French website manager, the data privacy regulator -- one of the most vocal and influential in Europe -- said the U.S. tech giant hadn't taken sufficient measures to guarantee data privacy rights under European Union regulation when data was transferred between Europe and the United States. 
""These (measures) are not sufficient to exclude the accessibility of this data to U.S. intelligence services,"" the regulator said in a statement. 
""There is therefore a risk for French website users who use this service and whose data is exported.""
The CNIL said that the French website manager in question had one month to comply with EU regulation and that it had issued similar orders to other website operators.
Google declined to comment on the CNIL decision. The firm has previously said that Google Analytics doesn't track people across the Internet and that organisations using this tool have control over the data they collect.
The CNIL's decision follows a similar one by its Austrian counterpart, coming after complaints by Vienna-based noyb (Non Of Your Business), an advocacy group founded by Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems who won a high profile case with Europe's top court in 2020. 
The Court of Justice of the European Union at that time scrapped a transatlantic data transfer deal known as the Privacy Shield, relied on by thousands of companies for services ranging from cloud infrastructure to payroll and finance, because of similar concerns.
Several large companies, including Google and Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have called for a new transatlantic data transfer pact to be swiftly agreed because of the legal risks posed to them. 

""In the long run we either need proper protections in the United States, or we will end up with separate products for the US and the EU,"" Schrems said in reaction to CNIL's decision. 
""I would personally prefer better protections in the US, but this is up to the US legislator - not to anyone in Europe.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Unilever warned of a hit to profitability this year as it struggles to lift prices enough to offset soaring costs, sparking fresh concern among investors after a failed bid for GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer health business last month. 
Consumer goods companies are grappling with a surge in commodities, energy, transport and labour costs. Unilever (NYSE:UL) is particularly exposed because of its reliance on emerging markets and food - where inflation is especially high. 
The maker of Dove soap and Ben and Jerry's ice cream raised underlying prices by 2.9% in 2021, including a 4.9% jump in the fourth quarter. That helped ease the pressure on margins, with sales volumes staying flat in the final quarter.
However, the company warned that, despite planning more price increases, it expected underlying operating margins to drop by 140-240 basis points this year, following just a 10 basis point fall in 2021. 
Finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said it faced a 2 billion euros-plus ($2.3 billion) hit from inflation in the first half of 2022, falling to about 1.5 billion euros in the second half.
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne was surprised by the scale of the forecast decline in margins. 
""Is this the major margin reset we have argued for? Or does it only cover the commodity costs? If it is all about covering the higher commodity costs, what happened to pricing power?"" he said. 
""If there really is so little pricing power, what does that say about the long term future?""
Unilever's shares were down 1.3% at 1230 GMT. 
The company said the fall in margins was also due to investments in advertising, R&D and operational capital expenditure and that it expected them to be ""restored after 2022, with the bulk coming back in 2023 and the rest in 2024.""
LISTENING TO INVESTORS
Unilever has recently lagged rivals such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Nestle, raising questions among some investors when it made a surprise 50 billion pound ($68 billion) bid for GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer health arm last month. Critics said it was a risky and costly bid at a time when Unilever should be focusing on improving performance.
""We have engaged extensively with our shareholders in recent weeks and received a strong message that the evolution of our portfolio needs to be measured,"" Chief Executive Alan Jope said, ruing out major deals for the foreseeable future.
""There was a moment in time where we felt, and still feel, that a transaction around GSK's consumer health business would have created value for Unilever,"" Jope said. It would have helped ""accelerate that course into health and wellbeing for our company,"" he added.
Instead, the Hellmann's mayonnaise to Sunsilk shampoo firm said it would buy back up to 3 billion euros of shares over the next two years.
""The buyback reassures that they are committed to shareholder returns but, on the negative side, they see fewer investment opportunities within their own business,"" said Waverton Investment Management's Tineke Frikkee, whose fund invests in Unilever.
""The pressure on Jope and the board is already quite high,"" she added.
Shortly after the spurned approach to GSK, it was reported that https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/activist-hedge-fund-trian-builds-stake-unilever-ft-2022-01-23 activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners had built a stake in Unilever. Trian has not commented on the reports.
In late January, Unilever announced https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-cut-1500-management-jobs-strategic-overhaul-2022-01-25 a business revamp to focus on five product areas and 1,500 management job cuts.
""The 3 billion euro buyback isn't that big. The proceeds for selling their tea business were 4.5 billion euros, so they're not even giving back the full proceeds from that money coming in,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Warren Ackerman said. 
""But, certainly, I think the signal is the right one, and they have listened to shareholders on the acquisitions.""
Jope said the company remained ""absolutely resolved"" to move its portfolio towards the beauty, health and well-being product categories. ""But I would say we're more patient on how we get there. Bolt-ons remain part of the strategy,"" he told analysts.
Unilever reported a 4.9% rise in fourth-quarter underlying sales, driven by higher prices, beating analysts' mean forecast for 3.8% growth in a company poll. 
For the whole of 2021, underlying sales growth was 4.5%, the strongest for nine years. The company forecast growth of 4.5-6.5% this year.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Twitter stock (NYSE:TWTR) climbed 2.7% in premarket trading Thursday after the company launched a $4 billion share buyback, including $2 billion on an accelerated basis, with immediate effect.
The remaining repurchases will be done over time once the accelerated buyback is complete, according to the company. The company said it look at ways to use cash on hand to fund the program, including tapping the markets.
The news of the buyback overshadowed a mostly disappointing quarter that saw it fall behind both revenue and earnings estimates. The outlook disappointed too, a signal Twitter’s efforts at attracting more advertisers and monetizing the platform through newsletters and ‘Spaces’ chat rooms will take time to yield results.
The stock initially gained over 6% before a faster-than-expected increase in U.S. consumer prices hit markets, reinforcing expectations of aggressive monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve. Such fears, as so often, hit technology stocks hardest.
The social media platform is now projecting its first-quarter revenue to be $1.22 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. Even at the top end, it translates into a sequential drop of 19%. The annual comparison looks better, at a jump of 23%, broadly sustaining the trend seen in the fourth quarter's figures. 
Twitter expects another year of heavy costs from its stock-based compensation scheme, which will rise to $925 million from $630 million in 2021.
Monetizable daily active users, or users who see ads, grew 13% to 217 million in the fourth quarter, missing estimates. Ad engagements, which include clicks, fell 12%, partly owing to a shift toward video ads and other formats that take longer to attract users. They are, however, more profitable for Twitter.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse on Thursday capped a scandal-ridden year with a $2.2 billion quarterly loss and said 2022 earnings would be weighed down by restructuring and compensation costs.
Though Switzerland's second-biggest bank had flagged a large fourth-quarter loss, it was still steeper than expected.
Analysts pointed to slides in revenue across most of its business segments, in addition to hefty legal costs for its investment bank, while many of its rivals have posted robust results.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) also flagged a decline in adjusted pretax income for the first quarter. The bank's shares, which have lost just over a third of their value since the start of 2020, slid 5.6% by early afternoon trade.
""We see no reason to recommend bets in Credit Suisse securities,"" ZKB analyst Michael Kunz said after the results.
Credit Suisse's horrendous 2021 was marked by the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British finance firm Greensill and a $5.5 billion trading loss from the implosion of investment fund Archegos, both in March.
Net income attributable to shareholders for the year tumbled to a 1.6 billion franc loss versus a profit of 2.7 billion in 2020. 
CEO Thomas Gottstein said the bank was actively working on resolving legacy issues, noting a goodwill impairment charge relating to its acquisition of U.S. investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) in 2000.
Noting a major scaling back of its risk appetite following the twin hits in March, which prompted a series of sackings, investigations and a strategic overhaul, Gottstein said the bank's business had been hampered as it focused on remediation efforts and addressed further legacy matters. 
""We were a bank, which just embarked on a new organisational structure and had become very inward focused, especially in December. This all negatively impacted our franchise momentum,"" Gottstein told journalists on a call, regarding challenges the bank faced in the fourth quarter, adding steps to turn business around remained ongoing.
""This will not be a quick fix, and we expect 2022 will be a transition year, but we have made clear progress in creating the conditions for a much more stable and predictable bank,"" he said.
Last year's scandals, preceded by an executive spying scandal in 2019, have only been followed by more. It began 2022 with the abrupt departure https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-faces-money-laundering-charges-trial-bulgarian-cocaine-traffickers-2022-02-07 last month of its chairman brought in just nine months earlier and has become the first major Swiss bank to be tried in a criminal court https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-faces-money-laundering-charges-trial-bulgarian-cocaine-traffickers-2022-02-07, charged with allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros.
Credit Suisse has denied wrongdoing in the Bulgarian case.
Tasked with reforming the bank's freewheeling corporate culture, Chairman Axel Lehmann has said he wants to stick with his predecessor's strategy of focusing on wealth management, noting customer business remained excellent at the time of his appointment in January.
During the final quarter of 2021, Credit Suisse's investment banking division posted a 2.1 billion-franc pretax loss. The goodwill impairment for DLJ came to $1.7 billion.
Fixed income and sales & trading revenue tumbled 38% year on year while equity sales & trading revenues slid 26% as a result of the bank's exit from prime services announced in November. Capital markets revenue plunged 48%, while advisory revenue surged 51%.
Credit Suisse's flagship international wealth management business saw revenue fall 26%. It noted it had seen new net asset outflows of $3.2 billion in its separate Asia Pacific division, which it said were related to wealthy clients deleveraging as well as ""de-risking measures"" it had taken.
For the full year, inflows fell across all of its divisions, while its international wealth management division saw outflows of 1.1 billion francs.
The bank experienced substantial outflows related to the severing of private banking and investment banking ties with SoftBank and its founder Masayoshi Son, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, following a dispute https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-softbank-group-idUSKCN24L26V over https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/credit-suisse-may-take-legal-action-against-softbank-over-greensill-debt-court-2021-12-24 the Greensill-linked funds. 
The bank conducted a compliance review which also led to it severing ties with some other private banking clients, the person said.
It is now in the process of reorganising its wealth management business as a single unit under Francesco de Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) https://www.reuters.com/business/credit-suisse-announces-new-members-exec-board-2021-12-13, who re-joined this year.
The bank was now looking to move through a difficult phase and rebuild momentum in its asset gathering ""with the right risk appetite and right compliance processes"", the person said. 
Across the bank, assets under management rose 7% to 1.6 trillion Swiss francs, helped by a pickup in inflows for its asset management business.
The bank maintained its dividend at 0.10 francs per share.
In a surprise move, it said it did not plan to publish an internal report on the Greensill debacle.

The results contrast with those of rival UBS in particular, which reported its best annual profit since the global financial crisis, prompting it to hike share buybacks and its profit goals.

LONDON (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies need to improve how they refer to environment, social and governance factors in their ratings used by investors to direct huge sums into sustainable funds, the European Union's securities watchdog said on Thursday.
In the first half of 2021, assets in EU sustainable funds rose by 20% to 1.5 trillion euros, with credit rating agencies seeking to meet soaring investor interest in ESG factors, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said.
The EU wants to increase this flow of funds to help its economy meet net zero targets, but regulators worry about 'greenwashing' or sustainable credentials being over-inflated to attract cash.
There is a ""high level of divergence"" among raters in their ESG disclosures ""even for rated entities that are highly exposed to ESG factors"", ESMA said in a statement.
The watchdog set out guidance in March 2020 on how and when raters' considerations of ESG factors in their ratings are disclosed to investors in press releases.

It looked at 64,000 press releases published between January 2019 and December 2020, finding that the overall level of ESG disclosures has increased since the introduction of the guidelines.
""However, there is clearly room for further improvement: the level of ESG disclosures differs significantly across both CRAs and ESG factors, especially environmental topics,"" ESMA said.

Rivals Capri, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and Europe's LVMH also benefited from a rebound in demand for high-end fashion as cooped-up customers returned to social events and offices.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), which also owns  Coach  and Stuart Weitzman, raised its share buyback target for the year to $1.25 billion from $1 billion.
Luxury goods companies have been struggling with rising costs though, after the pandemic drove up labor shortages, freight charges and inflation, forcing Tapestry and its peers to raise prices in response.
""The pandemic taught companies they could sell less, charge more and make more money. Who chooses to retain those learnings will be key,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said.
""(Tapestry) continues to show a meticulous approach on driving up price and elevating their brand. This is helping to mitigate the freight and other supply chain pressures being felt by all.""
The luxury goods maker's gross margin was 68.1% for the second quarter, dragged by higher freight costs incurred to maintain product flow and meet consumer demand.
The company forecast fiscal 2022 revenue of about $6.75 billion, compared with a prior estimate of nearly $6.6 billion. It expects annual profit of $3.60 to $3.65 per share, up from $3.45 to $3.50 earlier.

Total revenue rose 27% to $2.14 billion in the second quarter ended Jan. 1, surpassing analysts' average estimate of $2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.33 per share, above estimates of $1.18.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 07:03AM ET</span>",Rogue employee or Goldman scapegoat? Ex-banker's 1MDB corruption trial to kick off,"By Luc Cohen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker charged with helping to embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund will go on trial in the United States next week, in a case that could shed light on how the bank responded to warnings of corruption. 
Roger Ng, Goldman's former investment banking chief in Malaysia, will be the first - and likely only - person to stand trial in the United States over one of the biggest financial scandals in Wall Street history. 
Ng's former boss, Timothy Leissner, pleaded guilty in 2018 to money laundering and corruption charges, while a Goldman subsidiary in 2020 pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law. 
Ng has pleaded not guilty to three counts of conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law. Opening statements are scheduled for Monday in federal court in Brooklyn. 
Prosecutors say Ng and Leissner evaded Goldman's internal compliance protocols. But Ng's lawyers say he had no role in the crimes and that Leissner falsely implicated him in an effort to reduce his punishment. Leissner, Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman, has not yet been sentenced. 
Legal experts said Ng faces tough odds since prosecutors will likely show the jury emails and online chats indicating his involvement, as well as financial records showing he benefited from the scheme. They are also expected to call Leissner as a witness. 
""They have a bit of a mountain to climb especially since his boss has turned on him and will provide the testimony necessary to link him into the conversations, the actions, the strategy which facilitated the criminal act,"" said Michael Weinstein, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at Cole Schotz PC and a former federal prosecutor. 
The charges against Ng, 50, are related to some $4.5 billion U.S. prosecutors say was embezzled between 2009 and 2014 from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a fund launched in 2009 by Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, to spur economic growth. 
During that period, prosecutors say, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for helping 1MDB sell $6.5 billion in bonds. But Ng, Leissner, and a Malaysian intermediary named Jho Low conspired to pay $1.6 billion in bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win the business for Goldman, according to prosecutors. 
Low has not been arrested by U.S. or Malaysian authorities. Malaysia says Low is in China, which Beijing has denied.
Goldman Sachs in 2020 paid a $2.3 billion fine, returned $600 million in ill-gotten gains and agreed for its Malaysian subsidiary to plead guilty in U.S. court as part of a deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), with the Department of Justice. 
Ng's lawyers acknowledge he introduced Low to Leissner, but say he had no further role in the scheme and later warned his superiors at Goldman that Low was ""not to be trusted,"" a November 2020 court filing shows. 
""He just wasn't involved with Leissner and Low and a host of other people in this stunningly massive series of crimes,"" said Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Ng, describing his client as a ""fall guy."" 
Agnifilo said financial inflows that Ng received that prosecutors call ill-gotten gains had nothing to do with 1MDB. 
'INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES'
The long-running scandal, which came to light in 2015, has had far-reaching consequences and led to widespread public outcry in Malaysia. Najib, who was voted out of office in 2018, is accused by Malaysian authorities of receiving more than $1 billion traceable to 1MDB. Najib, who has appealed a 12-year prison sentence, has consistently denied wrongdoing.
At least six other countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, have launched investigations into 1MDB's dealings. 
But after reaching the DPA in 2020, Goldman itself is unlikely to face any material damage from Ng's trial, said Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove. Chief Executive David Solomon has revived the bank's fortunes since his appointment as CEO in October 2018, delivering record annual profit in 2021.
""No one is going to come after David Solomon over what this guy did in Malaysia years ago,"" Bove said. ""I'm sure that there will be a lot of incendiary information that comes out, but from the standpoint of Wall Street, these pieces of information will be nothing but an embarrassment and annoyance.""
While Solomon in 2018 blamed the scandal on employees who ""broke the law"" and said the company's compliance was strong, he said at the time of the October 2020 settlement that there were ""institutional failures"" at the bank. 

That shift could make it hard for Ng to argue he is simply a scapegoat, said former federal prosecutor Bruce Searby. 
The argument ""doesn't take any responsibility away from Roger Ng,"" said Searby, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Washington, D.C.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Thursday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains ahead of the release of key consumer inflation data and with the earnings season in full flow.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.4%.
The major indices had a strong session Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ending over 300 points, or 0.9%, higher, the broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, rising 2.1%.
Investors have decided to bank some of those gains Thursday, despite more strong corporate earnings after Wednesday’s close, ahead of the release of the monthly inflation report which could provide clues over the pace of Federal Reserve tightening.
The January U.S. consumer prices release is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and the headline CPI is seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year in January, the highest number since 1982.
The weekly jobless claims number is also due at the same time, and is expected to show 230,000 people claiming benefits last week, marginally down from the previous week.
Earlier Thursday, the EU's executive arm said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro would grow 4.0% this year, a drop from its forecast of 4.3% growth in November, while inflation this year will be 3.5%, well above the European Central Bank's target of 2.0%, and much higher than its own forecast from November of 2.2%.
Back to the corporate sector, Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock traded over 7% higher premarket after the entertainment giant’s fourth-quarter results late Wednesday revealed strong subscriber growth in its streaming services and more people returning to its theme parks.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock also climbed 5% premarket after the ride-hailing company reported its second operating profit for a quarter while its food delivery business delivered its maiden profit at the basic operating level.
There are more earnings due Thursday, including the two beverage giants PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), the fintech company Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), online travel agency  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), and online real estate marketplace  Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z).
Oil prices edged higher, boosted by data from the Energy Information Administration showing that U.S. crude inventories fell the most for a week since October 2018.
The crude market has been pressured over the last couple of sessions by the resumption of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks that could result in the Persian Gulf country adding supplies to the global market.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $90.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $92.23.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – ADRs of Unilever (NYSE:UL) fell 2% in premarket trading Thursday after the company said it will take two years for it to regain the profitability levels it saw last year 2021, as it responds to rising input price pressures.
The consumer goods giant expects “very high input cost inflation in the first half of over 2 billion euro” ($2.3 billion). The hit should ease to $1.5 billion in the second half, it said. High costs for marketing and advertising are expected to compound other operational issues. 
Unilever said it expected margins to be ""restored after 2022, with the bulk coming back in 2023 and the rest in 2024.""
Unilever makes hundreds of products, ranging from floor-cleaner Domestos and Dove soap to Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, exposing it to multiple sources of inflation. Competition is intense and price hikes above a certain threshold risk consumers opting for cheaper alternatives. In the fourth quarter, pricing accounted for all a 4.9% rise in underlying sales. Volumes were flat, by contrast.
The company expects 2022 underlying sales growth to be 4.5%-6.5%, with the operating margin eroding by 1.4 to 2.4 percentage points.
Competition, margins and new markets were the focus when CEO Alan Jope launched the $68-billion bid for GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) consumer health business, a pursuit the company quickly gave up under shareholder pressure. It's ruling out any further big M&A for now and, in order to assuage investor concerns, it is now proposing to buy back shares worth up to 3 billion euro in next two years.

PARIS (Reuters) -Pernod Ricard is more optimistic about its outlook for fiscal year 2022 after strong demand in the United States, China and Europe helped the French spirits maker beat first-half profit and sales forecasts, lifting its shares by over 3%.
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which owns Martell cognac, Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka, said it now expected ""strong"" sales growth in its 2022 fiscal year, which ends on June 30, despite potential disruptions tied to the COVID-19 virus.
Previously it had guided for ""good"" sales growth.
The world's second-biggest spirits group said sales growth would drive operating margin expansion, although this would moderate from the first half due to increased investments.
Resilient consumption by people staying at home, the reopening of bars and restaurants and a gradual recovery in travel retail would fuel sales growth across regions, it said.
Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard told Reuters, however, that it was too early to make a quantitative guidance for sales or profit growth in fiscal 2022.
""We are giving a qualitative guidance. A key unknown is the performance during the Chinese New Year this month,"" he said in a phone interview.
""We will have more visibility in mid-March, though we remain very confident over growth momentum,"" he added.
Ricard later told analysts there was a ""slightly softer start"" to Chinese New Year when compared to last year.
The strong first half reflected a 9% jump in sales in the United States, Pernod's top market, with growth driven by Jameson whiskey which benefited from strong demand in bars and restaurants. In China, sales growth was 14% with very good demand during the Mid-Autumn festival.
With recurring free cash flow of 1.4 billion euros ($1.60 billion) as of the end of December, Pernod Ricard also increased its share buyback programe by 250 million euros in the first half.
Shares in Pernod Ricard, which have slipped 9% this year after rising 35% in 2021, were up 3% in morning trade.
Alexandre Ricard told Reuters the group would also continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions, notably to beef up its fast-growing Specialty brands portfolio.
""Although guidance remains non-quantitative, we note more positive language, 'strong' versus 'good' sales growth, with margin expansion, plus an incremental 250 million euros in buybacks for FY22 on top of the 500 million euros already announced,"" Trevor Sterling from Bernstein wrote in a note.
Profit from current operations in the six months to Dec. 31 reached 1.998 billion euros, an organic rise of 22% that was more than analysts' expectations for a 16.7% rise.
Sales totalled 5.959 billion euros in the first half, representing an organic rise of 17%, compared with analysts' expectations for a 15.1% rise.

Last month, rival  Diageo  (LON:DGE) reported first-half sales up nearly 16%, buoyed by high-end spirits for home use while bars increased orders as they reopened after lockdowns.

The company's spending on advertising and promotions, closely watched by investors, grew over the second half of the year. That weighed on the annual operating margin which came in at 19.1%, slightly missing the consensus cited by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts ahead of the results. 
The stock was down 2.5% at 1057 GMT, among the worst performers on France's blue-chip CAC 40 index. Analysts at Evercore pointed to second-half profits lagging sales, resulting in a 50-basis-point contraction of the operating margin. 
""This lack of operating leverage, and arguably, modest return on the hike - which in turn translated into sales growth in-line with peers - could be indicative of diminishing returns on incremental marketing (overspending),"" they said in a note to clients.
L'Oreal Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus defended the increase in a call with analysts.
""In this year of rebound, we rebalanced a little bit to allow (the consumer products division) to invest more strongly in their brands and it paid off"", he said, citing an acceleration of the division's quarter-on-quarter growth and compared to the overall market.
The advertising investments were ""a very large step-up on a much bigger sales basis,"" analysts from Bernstein noted, while those at UBS flagged that L'Oreal spent nearly 2 billion euros more on marketing than in 2020, a 190-basis-point increase as percentage of sales.
Hieronimus added that the active cosmetics division, the only other division that posted a slight decline in operating profit margin, showed ""major improvement"" in absolute value.
Credit Suisse analysts cited concerns about a slowdown in China coming to ""fruition,"" although the company said in a statement on Wednesday that growth in the region was still 50% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.

Hieronimus told the call that performance in China slowed in the second half of the year due to a high comparison base and headwinds from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, but added the mid-term outlook was very good.
Fuelled by demand in North America, the beauty giant's fourth-quarter sales of 9.09 billion euros ($10.40 billion) beat analysts' forecast.

Concern has mounted over the possible disruption of energy supplies from Russia following the buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine and heightened tensions between Moscow and the West.
""Our main crude supply come from the Middle East through term contracts while we buy Russian crude in spot markets whenever it's economically profitable,"" Soichiro Tanaka, Eneos' senior vice president, told an earnings news conference.
""So even if it becomes difficult to procure Russian crude, we'll be able to easily buy alternatives in spot markets,"" he said.
Global investors are closely watching the outcome of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks which resumed this week. A deal could lift U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil and ease the tightness in global supply.
Tanaka was not aware of any consideration being made at Eneos over resuming oil imports from Iran, he said.
Eneos' net profit for April-December jumped nearly five-fold to 331.83 billion yen ($2.9 billion) from a year earlier as surging oil prices caused a hefty appraisal gain on its inventory and higher earnings from oil and gas assets.
Stronger copper prices also bolstered gains at its metals unit. 
But Eneos stuck to its profit forecast of 280 billion yen for the year to March 31, citing restructuring charges, lower output at the Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile and declining petrochemical margins in this quarter.
Its refinery's run rate, which improved to 75% in October-December from 68% the previous quarter, will maintain a decent level this quarter as there is no system trouble, Tanaka said. 

Eneos also announced its executive vice president Takeshi Saito will become the president from April 1, replacing Katsuyuki Ota who will become the vice chairman.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Uber stock (NYSE:UBER) traded 5.7% higher in premarket Thursday after the ride-hailing company reported its second operating profit for a quarter while its food delivery business delivered its maiden profit at a basic operating level.
The company reported the most active users in its history at a time when Covid-related disruptions led rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) to report a quarterly drop in ridership. Monthly active platform consumers reached 118 million, up 27% year-on-year, a metric also helped by higher number of airports ramping up operations after the pandemic. Airport rides are among the most profitable routes for Uber.
After some impact on the business in late December, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said mobility is starting to bounce back with gross bookings up 25% month-on-month in the most recent week. However, the company's forecasts for the current quarter were below market expectations, seeing revenue only at $26 billion rather than $27.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA around $115 million, rather than the $151 million consensus.
Gross bookings in the fourth quarter grew 51% year-over-year to nearly $26 billion, split into over $11 billion from mobility and more than $13 billion from delivery. Mobility gross bookings approached pre-pandemic levels, the company said. The company also has a freight business where revenue topped $1 billion in the fourth quarter.
Trips during the quarter grew 23% to 1.8 billion, or around 19 million trips per day, compared to 18 million trips daily in the third quarter.
Revenue in the key mobility business jumped 55% to $2.3 billion. Higher volumes offset fatter driver incentives and helped deliver a better EBITDA margin on adjusted basis.
Delivery revenue rose 78% to $2.4 billion. The company cut back on incentives in the business, that along with higher volumes, helped it report its first adjusted operating profit.
Total revenue grew 83% to $5.8 billion.
Net income in the quarter was $892 million, reflecting one-off unrealized gains from stakes in  Grab Holdings  (NASDAQ:GRAB) and self-driving company Aurora Innovation (NASDAQ:AUR), both of which have fallen sharply since the end of the last quarter.

OSLO (Reuters) -DNB reported a 17% rise in fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, in line with forecasts, as a relaxation of coronavirus restrictions boosted Norway's largest bank.
Net profit rose to 6.16 billion crowns ($698 million) for the October-December quarter from 5.27 billion a year earlier, in line with the 6.15 billion expected by analysts in a poll compiled by the bank.
""Once again large parts of the business sector are going at full speed,"" CEO Kjerstin Braathen said in a statement.
DNB proposed a dividend of 9.75 crowns per share for 2021, up from 9 crowns the previous year but below the 9.94 crowns expected by analysts.
The bank will also ask its owners to sanction a plan for share buybacks as a way to boost shareholder returns, the CEO told analysts and reporters.
The Norwegian Competition Authority has rejected DNB's plan to acquire smaller rival Sbanken, and unless the decision is overturned on appeal this could leave DNB with even more excess capital, analysts have said.
DNB's net interest income rose 8.5% to 806 million crowns, and while its return on equity of 10.7% in 2021 fell short of its target of above 12%, it said it would deliver this by the end of 2023, helped partly by rising interest rates.
Norway's central bank started raising its key policy rate in September last year after a series of cuts in 2020 had left it at an unprecedented zero percent. Currently at 0.5%, the central bank aims for three hikes in 2022.
While DNB's net interest income and overall earnings were stronger than forecast, the bank's costs also rose more than expected and the dividend fell slightly short,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note to clients.

DNB's shares traded down 1.1% at 1022 GMT, lagging a rise of 0.6% in European banking stocks.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) said on Thursday that operating profit rose nearly fivefold in its first quarter, as its two biggest divisions - steel and materials trading - benefited from significantly higher steel prices.
Larger rival ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) also pointed to tailwinds from higher selling prices thanks to a recovering global economy and higher demand for steel.
Thyssenkrupp's adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 378 million euros ($432 million) in the October-December period, the first three months of the group's fiscal year, up from 78 million a year earlier.
Free cash flow before M&A, however, was a negative 858 million euros due to a rise in working capital related to ""ongoing bottlenecks in the supply chain with the resulting delays in customer call-offs,"" the company said.
""We had a good first quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Klaus Keysberg said. ""But we're still not where we want to be which is why we're not letting up and continue to work at full speed on implementing our plan.""
The group, which makes everything from car parts to submarines, continues to expect full-year adjusted EBIT of 1.5-1.8 billion euros and free cash flow before M&A to break even.
Shares in the company fell as much as 3%, giving up earlier gains as supply chain fears and concerns over the negative free cash flows outweighed positive results.
Adjusted EBIT at the group's steel division, which could be spun off at some point but not this year, increased sixfold to 124 million euros, as higher selling prices offset a strong rise in raw materials and energy costs.

Meantime, Thyssenkrupp's automotive technology unit struggled with an ongoing shortage of semiconductors, causing operating profit to fall by two thirds in the period.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), the world's second largest steelmaker, said on Thursday it would increase its dividend and announced a new $1 billion capital return for the first half of the year after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.
The uplift brings the capital returns announced by the company since September 2020 to $7.2 billion. It will seek further authorisation to repurchase shares at its annual general meeting. It raised its dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.38, a 27% increase.
Meanwhile, the company's net debt increased to $4.03 billion from $3.87 billion, 15.3% above ING analysts' expectations. Shares were down 2.93% to 28.52 euros as of 0941 GMT.
ArcelorMittal said it expects steel consumption, excluding China, to grow between 2.5% and 3% and sees its own steel shipments rising by 3% in 2022. It sees a positive medium to long-term outlook for steel with inventories now replenished and demand recovery continuing, particularly if the automotive supply chain constraints ease.
The group also said the global steel industry would benefit from structural changes occurring in China, including: China's focus on decarbonisation and the removal of VAT‐rebates on steel exports. 

Fourth-quarter core profit (EBITDA), the figure most watched by the market, was $5.05 billion, almost five times the year-ago figure. That was slightly higher than the average forecast of $4.95 billion in a company poll.
The company expects strong EBITDA and free cash flow generation in 2022.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Disney  stock (NYSE:DIS) jumped 6.7% in premarket trading Thursday after its fourth-quarter results revealed strong subscriber growth in its streaming services and more people returning to its theme parks.
The company added 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers in the first quarter, easily eclipsing Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) 8.3 million additions in its recent quarter. Those subscribers were drawn in by Marvel’s ‘Hawkeye’ and the new TV series ‘The Book of Boba Fett’ under the Star Wars franchise on the platform. They also paid more compared to last year.
As of January 1, Disney+ Hotstar had nearly 130 million subscribers. That compares to Netflix’s nearly 222 million.
The company is pouring billions into ramping up its content, spending heavily on programming, marketing and technology. This also means its Direct-to-Consumer business is still bleeding heavily. The unit's operating loss rose 27% to $593 million.
Meanwhile, operating income at ESPN and ABC, Disney’s legacy TV units, fell 13% to $1.5 billion as higher programming costs offset rise in advertising and fees from cable TV distributors.
That, however was largely offset by the explosive release of pent-up demand at its theme parks as concerns about Covid-19 ebbed.
Disney Parks, Experiences and Products revenue doubled to $7.2 billion in a quarter when most of its parks operated without Covid restrictions. 
The products business suffered due to closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe, the company said.
Total revenue rose 34% to nearly $22 billion. Adjusted profit per share was $1.06 and easily beat estimates.

LONDON (Reuters) -Zurich Insurance expects continued revenue and profit growth in the next two years, its chief financial officer said on Thursday, after the Swiss insurer reported its biggest annual profit since the financial crisis.
Insurers were gloomy about the outlook when the pandemic took hold in early 2020, but have remained profitable after excluding COVID-19 from many policies and raising premiums.
Zurich, Europe's fifth-largest insurer, reported an above-forecast 35% increase in 2021 operating income to $5.7 billion, its highest level since 2007, helped by a strong showing from its commercial business and lower COVID-19 claims.
Operating profit was forecast at $5.5 billion, a company-compiled consensus forecast showed. 
""You see growth in both revenue and earnings. It will continue through 2022 and I expect at this stage it will continue at least in 2023."","" CFO George Quinn said on a call with reporters after Zurich said it expected to meet or exceed its 2022 financial targets.
Zurich's shares were little changed at 0905 GMT versus a 0.33% rise in European insurance stocks. Vontobel said it retained its ""hold"" recommendation on the stock, given ""elevated valuation multiples versus European and U.S. peers"". 
The insurer set out three-year targets https://www.reuters.com/article/zurich-ins-group-investors-idUSL8N27U179 in November 2019, including raising its target for business operating profit after tax return on equity to more than 14% from the previous goal of more than 12%. Return on equity came in at 14% for 2021.
Zurich plans to sell more books of life insurance which are closed to new customers, after it said last month it would release about $1.2 billion of capital by selling its Italian life and pensions back book to Portugal's GamaLife.

Zurich has already had interest in some of its German closed life books, but was not yet at final offer stage, chief executive Mario Greco told Reuters, adding that a deal would take some months to complete but would be ""much bigger"" than the Italian sale.
Zurich proposed a dividend of 22 Swiss francs per share, a rise of 10% on the previous year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) unveiled the latest versions of its flagship Galaxy S smartphones on Wednesday which feature enhanced camera functions and a faster processor chip, hoping the upgrade will revive sales after two weak years.
The S22 series will directly compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 13 launched last September. Samsung (KS:005930)'s two-track premium mobile strategy has it launching flagship models in the first half of a year and Galaxy Z foldable phones in the second.
Aimed at appealing to consumers who are fussy about video and photo quality, Samsung said the S22 phones' camera offers clearer low light and night shots as well as automatic framing that can track up to 10 people, ensuring they are all in the frame and in focus. 
The most expensive version, the S22 Ultra, comes with a stylus - a signature feature of Samsung's large-screen Galaxy Note model which many fans and analysts now believe to be discontinued.
While Samsung saw sales of smartphones drop off during the pandemic, arch-rival Apple logged sales gains.
The Galaxy S suite of products usually sells more than 30 million units annually. But it logged less than 25 million in 2020 and a little less than 30 million last year, hampered in part by component shortages, said Jene Park, a senior analyst at research firm Counterpoint. 
""We believe that Samsung will ship more than 15 million units of the Galaxy S22 family in the first half of 2022. If the initial sell-through is good we can expect it to reach 30 million units in 2022,"" he said.
A global semiconductor shortage is expected to continue into this year but analysts predict Samsung will fare better than many rivals thanks to its huge buying power and strong grip on its supply chain.

Samsung said the S22 Ultra, S22 Plus and S22 will be widely available starting Feb. 25. 
In the United States, the Galaxy S22 will be priced from $799.99, the S22 Plus at $999.99 and the S22 Ultra at $1,199.99.

PARIS (Reuters) -Societe Generale struck a confident note for 2022 on Thursday after the French bank's profit hit 1.79 billion euros ($2.05 billion) in the fourth quarter on lower pandemic-related charges and a retail banking and equity trading rebound.
France's third-largest listed bank after BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) also said it expected to improve profitability in the coming years.
""The group is entering 2022 with confidence,"" Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said in a statement, adding that 2021's earnings were the ""best financial results"" in SocGen's history.
SocGen said it expected its underlying cost-to-income ratio, a key profitability metric, to be between 66% and 68% this year, from 67% in 2021 and 74.6% in 2020 and beyond 2022, the ratio will decline year after year.
Shares in Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) rose by 3.92% to 37.03 euros, their highest since October 2018.
""CIB (corporate and investment banking) turnaround is on track and French retail top line is also surprising positively,"" analysts at JP Morgan said in a note.
The bank's quarterly net income jumped to 1.79 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from 470 million euros a year ago, with a cost of risk, reflecting provisions against bad loans, down by 87.5%.
RISK COST
SocGen expects the cost of risk in 2022 to be below 30 basis points (bps), which compares with 13 bps in 2021 and 64 bps in 2020 when the worst of the coronavirus crisis and lockdowns prompted banks to set aside huge amounts of money to deal with loans that could turn sour.
In the last quarter of 2021, revenue was up 13.4%, helped by an 11% rise in French retail banking, and sales in equity trading rising by nearly 23%.
SocGen also said its financing and advisory business delivered its ""best historical annual performance"" last year, with record revenue of 814 million euros in the fourth quarter.
SocGen and Dutch rival ING said last week they were discussing the possibility of serving ING's online banking customers in France via SocGen's Boursorama, after ING's decision to quit the French market.
SocGen has streamlined operations in recent years to boost returns and financial solvency, notably with the sale of businesses in Central and Eastern Europe and by refocusing its corporate and investment banking. 

The bank also planned to cut 3,700 jobs between 2023 and 2025 as it merges its two French retail banking networks.

Beazley, which provides casualty and property, cyber and political risk insurance, had a combined ratio - a key measure of an insurer's profitability - of 93% compared to 109% a year earlier. A level below 100% indicates an underwriting profit.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd reported a 57% jump in third-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by higher revenues that offset an increase in costs due to supply chain disruptions and semiconductor shortages.
The company, chaired by Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra, said it also saw a sharp rise in exports of automobiles and tractors in the October-December quarter. 
Carmakers are seeing a pickup in demand compared to pandemic-hit 2021, but production has come under pressure from a global chip shortage and rising commodity prices. Several major Indian carmakers raised prices last year to pass on some of the excess costs to customers.
""Our auto business has done well despite supply side challenges, while our farm business has shown market share increase despite a slowdown in the market,"" Anish Shah, managing director at Mahindra said in a statement to the stock exchange.
Mahindra's revenue from the auto sector grew 15% during the reported quarter and it said the auto business was continuing to see a strong booking pipeline with more than 155,000 pending orders for its vehicles.
Consolidated net profit from continuing operations rose to 19.87 billion rupees ($265.11 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from 12.68 billion rupees a year ago.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - French automaker  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY) has backed a moratorium on deep-sea mining, the company told Reuters on Wednesday, committing to exclude seabed metals from its supply chain in a blow to the nascent industry.
In October, French President Emmanuel Macron identified deep seabed exploration as an investment priority for France, highlighting the potential of gaining access to ""rare metals"" as well as a better understanding of marine ecosystems. The French government is the top shareholder of Renault (PA:RENA), holding 15.01%.
The decision by Renault - one of France's two leading carmakers - adds to pressure on the fledgling deep-sea mining industry which aims to extract battery metals like cobalt, nickel, and manganese from potato-sized nodules on the seabed.
Companies that hold exploration licences on the seabed, including The Metals Company, GSR and UK Seabed Resources - a subsidiary of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s UK-based arm - hope to eventually sell seabed metals to carmakers.
A Renault spokesperson said its call for a moratorium was aligned with the government's stance because France ""plans to invest in seabed exploration in order to identify potential solutions for sustainable extraction"".
Macron had stopped short of backing seabed mining, with a nod to the controversy around the nascent industry which critics say could wipe out as-yet-undiscovered species.
""I can already hear the debate coming, I am not talking about exploitation for the moment, I am talking about exploration,"" he said in a speech in October to launch a ""France 2030"" investment plan.
France holds an exploration contract, through the Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), for an area of 75,000 square kilometres in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast stretch of seabed in the North Pacific rich in polymetallic nodules.
The French government and IFREMER did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Renault's logo appeared on a deep-sea mining campaign website listing the companies that have backed the moratorium, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930) SDI and BMW Group. 
A spokesperson for Renault said the logo was added on Tuesday, and the decision was taken as part of the carmaker's sustainability strategy.
U.S. electric carmaker Rivian also joined the call for a moratorium on Wednesday.
""Rivian shares the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition's goal of protecting our oceans,"" the company told Reuters in an email.
Companies that have signed the moratorium commit to excluding such metals from their supply chains and not financing deep seabed mining. 
The moratorium calls for a clear demonstration, before any deep-sea mining occurs, that it can be managed in a way that ensures the protection of marine habitats. 
""Governments should listen to these companies and agree on a moratorium to allow for independent science and invest in circular economy solutions to take the pressure off our ocean,"" Jessica Battle, lead at WWF's No Deep Seabed Mining initiative, said. 

The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a United Nations body, is drawing up regulations governing seabed mining in the high seas - areas outside any national jurisdiction.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, boosted by strong earnings from German industrial giant  Siemens  ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data.
By 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded 0.1% higher and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1%.
The quarterly earnings season has been the focus of trading in Europe so far Thursday, with Siemens (DE:SIEGn), the largest industrial manufacturing company in Europe, leading the way. Its stock soared 7% after it reported a jump in industrial profit in the first quarter of its fiscal year, based on an “extraordinary” surge in orders from its customers. 
The banking sector was busy Thursday, with  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) stock rising 1% and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) stock rose 3.8% as both French lenders posted strong fourth-quarter numbers, helped by lower pandemic-related charges.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) bucked the trend, with the Swiss bank’s stock falling 4% after it posted a fourth-quarter net loss of 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 billion), hurt by provisions to settle its investment bank's legal costs after a turbulent 2021. 
ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) stock fell 4.1% with investors fretting about the world’s largest steelmaker forecasting slower global steel demand growth for this year even as the company reported its biggest annual profit in more than a decade.
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR) stock fell 2% after the consumer goods giant forecast lower margins this year as it grapples with soaring inflation, while Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) stock slumped 16% after the German online takeaway food company forecast another year of losses after finally breaking even last year.
Still, Thursday gains are relatively small with investors reluctant to push the boat out ahead of the release of the monthly U.S. inflation report later in the day, as this should offer new clues on how aggressively the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy this year.
The January U.S. consumer prices release is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with the headline CPI seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year, which would be the highest level in almost 40 years. Analysts warn that the figure continue to be distorted by the weight given to certain items of only limited relevance to living costs, notably used car prices.
Oil prices edged higher, boosted by data from the Energy Information Administration showing that U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.76 million barrels during the week ended Feb. 4, the most for a week since October 2018.
The drawdown was triple that projected by industry analysts and marked the second straight weekly drop in crude stocks.
The crude market has been pressured over the last couple of sessions by the resumption of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks that could result in the Persian Gulf country adding supplies to the global market.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $90.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $91.81.   
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,832.65/oz, while EUR/USD edged 0.1% higher to 1.1428.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 01:31AM ET</span>",France's Credit Agricole beats profit target a year early,"LONDON (Reuters) -Credit Agricole SA beat its 2022 profit target a year early as lower costs for troubled loans and rising revenues across business lines boosted fourth-quarter results beyond consensus, France's second-biggest listed bank said on Thursday.
The lender said it would present a new strategic plan for 2025 on June 22 after underlying net income came in at about 5.4 billion euros ($6.17 billion) for 2021, well above its 5-billion target for this year.
Other key 2022 targets, such as a cost-to-income ratio below 60% and a return on tangible equity of more than 11% were met, with 2021 figures standing at 57.8% and 13.1% respectively. 
The group, which has a policy of paying half of profits to shareholders, said it would propose a 2021 dividend of 1.05 euro per share which includes a 20 cents catch-up for the 2019 dividend which could not be paid.
The European Central Bank restricted dividend payments in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis to beef up lenders' balance sheets but with those restrictions lifted, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) intends to add a 20 cent payment to its 2022 dividend to compensate shareholders. 
Speaking to reporters, Credit Agricole's CFO Jerome Grivet declined to comment further on the group's payout policy, explaining any change would be divulged during the presentation of the new strategic plan in June. 
""At this stage, we don't plan to start further buyback"", he added.
Rebounding economic growth and rising interest rates have prompted other European banks to raise shareholder returns.
Shares in Credit Agricole touched a session high of 14 euros on Wednesday, their highest level since 2018 after bouncing back nearly 150% since the coronavirus crash in March 2020.
Fourth-quarter profit jumped to 1.428 billion euros from 124 million euros a year earlier when a 778 million euros goodwill impairment for its Italian operations hit its results.
Like-for-like cost of risk, reflecting provisions against bad loans, fell by 34.5% over the quarter to 328 millions euros. 
French and international retail banking, asset servicing, investment banking, insurances and asset management all saw double-digit increases in net income in the last three months of 2021. 
Overall, revenue rose to 5.8 billion euros, up more than 10% from the same period in 2020. 
Low customer demand was blamed for lower revenue in capital markets, which fell 8% due notably to an 11.8% drop for fixed income, currencies and commodities.

Credit Agricole's listed asset management unit Amundi reported on Wednesday a strong rise in earnings helped by its retail business and expansion in Asia.

""The talks on Kumtor are nearing their conclusion. We are settling the matter with Centerra Gold,"" Japarov told an energy conference, the Interfax news agency said.
Centerra kicked off arbitration in May 2021 after the former Soviet republic took over the country's biggest mine for allegedly posing a danger to human lives or the environment. The company has denied all the allegations.
Last month, Centerra Gold confirmed it was in talks with the Bishkek government for an out-of-court settlement of the dispute, saying it should receive about 26.1% of its common stock held by Kyrgyzstan.

The iPhone assembler will build a factory on 200 hectares (494.21 acres) of an industrial zone in Batang in Central Java to make battery cells, cathode precursor and telecommunication spare parts in addition to the vehicles, Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia told a forum on Wednesday.
The minister said the investment would reach $8 billion, though Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way clarified to reporters in Taipei on Thursday that the figure was the expected total investment by the five parties in the EV partnership and not just by his company. Liu did not give a breakdown of the investments. 
Foxconn last month said it would partner with Indonesia's investment ministry and state-owned Indonesia Battery Corporation, energy firm PT Indika Energy and Taiwanese electric scooter vendor Gogoro for a wide scope of investment on EVs, including battery manufacturing.
Foxconn has expanded EV activities in recent years, announcing deals with U.S. startup Fisker Inc and Thai energy group PTT. 
Indonesia has been trying to court Foxconn's investment for years but a previous deal agreed in 2015 collapsed.
""Foxconn's (investment) didn't happen because it had asked for land and tax holiday incentive before. So I got orders from the president to find a way to get Foxconn,"" Bahlil said.

""Now the government has provided cheap land in an industrial zone ... close to a toll road and railway,"" he added. 
Top nickel producer Indonesia has ambitious plans to process its rich supplies of nickel laterite ore used in lithium batteries and eventually become a global EV production and export hub.

(Reuters) -National Australia Bank Ltd, the country's No. 2 lender, posted a bigger-than-expected jump in first-quarter profit on Thursday as a robust property market brought a flurry of new businesses, sending its shares 4% higher.
The result caps a reporting season for the country's so-called Big Four lenders where investors have looked past wafer-thin profit margins - due to fierce competition for mortgages - and focused on the benefits as interest rates start rising, possibly this year.
Melbourne-headquartered NAB said cash earnings, a key measure of bank performance that only includes ongoing business, leapt 9.1% to A$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion) in the December quarter, from the year-ago period, topping a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimate of about A$1.6 billion.
""NAB has started the 2022 financial year well,"" Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said in a statement alongside the limited trading update. ""Asset quality remained benign and good momentum has continued across our business despite the environment remaining competitive.""
Like its three main rivals earlier this month, NAB said its loan margins thinned due to competition and a shift to fixed-rate loans - which are less profitable - as customers sought to protect themselves against rising rates.
But NAB's margin narrowed the least - by five basis points, compared with 14 basis points at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) - and investors cheered its cost controls and positioning for when rates rise.
NAB shares rose 4.3% against a flat overall market by the afternoon. Other banking stocks were also flat.
""A bit of pressure in the net interest margin: that's fine. What a lot of them are doing is competing for market share and building their book moving into higher rates,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Funds Management, which holds stocks of leading banks.
""Historically rising rates are a good time for banks.""
After the initial economic upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia's banks have flourished as emergency-level interest rates and a shift to working from home fuelled an eye-popping property market rally.
Many economists had forecast a pandemic-fuelled drop in house prices, yet they soared 22% in 2021 nationwide, adding pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to start raising rates as soon as August.
That may also benefit banks, since higher rates allow them to pay people with deposit accounts lower interest than what they charge for mortgages and business loans.

In the December quarter, NAB said Australian home and business lending rose 2.6% and 3.4%, respectively, and loans in New Zealand grew 2.2%. Revenue from home and business lending, including fees, rose 5%.

""The board would like to update shareholders that, following consultation by the company with the Securities Industry Council(SIC) regarding the termination right, the SIC has ruled that it has no objections to the company's exercise of the termination right,"" SPH said in a statement late on Wednesday.
Conglomerate Keppel, which counts state investor Temasek Holdings as a major shareholder, said its fully-owned unit did not agree with SPH's move and it filed an arbitration notice with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
Keppel made an offer in August to buy SPH's global portfolio of property assets, student accommodation and elderly care homes.
But Cuscaden - a consortium of billionaire property tycoon Ong Beng Seng's Hotel Properties and two independently managed portfolio companies of Temasek - came up with a rival offer.
The rare bidding war between two groups linked to Temasek then resulted in Cuscaden making a higher offer that was backed by SPH's independent directors in November.
""With the latest SIC ruling, SPH and Cuscaden can move forward expeditiously to table the Cuscaden Offer for SPH shareholders to vote,"" Christopher Lim, Group Executive Director of Hotel Properties Limited and spokesperson for Cuscaden, said in a statement.

Cuscaden had offered around S$2.40 per share, or S$3.9 billion, while Keppel offered S$2.351 per share, or S$3.74 billion.

Evergrande, with more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion international bonds deemed to be in default, has been struggling to repay creditors, suppliers, and deliver homes.
Shares gained as much as 7.2% to HK$1.79, their highest since Jan. 25. That compared with a loss of 0.3% in the benchmark Hang Seng Index and a rise of 2.5% in Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index.
China Evergrande needs to clear its debt by fully restoring construction and sales activities and not by selling assets on the cheap, its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, told an internal meeting, vowing to complete half of pre-sold homes this year.
Hui said the firm aimed to fully resume construction work across China this month, compared with 93.2% at the end of last year, with a goal of delivering 600,000 apartments in 2022.
Evergrande started having trouble repaying its suppliers and creditors in June as a bloated real estate sector suffered from deleveraging, triggering massive selloffs in its shares and bonds.
During the early days of the firm's debt crisis, its CEO, Xia Haijun, cashed out his bond holdings for a total of $128 million between July 27 to August 17 at prices of 35.88 cents to 52.38 cents, stock exchange filings on Wednesday showed.

The prices compared to Evergrande's bonds trading at around 15 cents on Thursday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, even after U.S. counterparts closed their best day in the month to date. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was on a downward trend ahead of U.S. data that could impact how fast the Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy.

In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.02%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.23%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.07% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.63%.
U.S. futures floundered after the S&P 500 extended a broad rally and the Nasdaq 100 jumped over 2% on Wednesday. Shares in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. gained in late trading, thanks to strong earnings. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stabilized, boosted by a strong auction.
The U.S. inflation data, including the consumer price index, is due later in the day.
“The market is being somewhat sanguine about what will happen in the second half of 2022,” Franklin Templeton Fixed Income chief investment officer Sonal Desai said in a note.
“There is an expectation that inflation will decline sharply. I think that might be optimistic because a lot of the factors driving inflation will still be with us. The Fed is already behind the curve.”
Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester, alongside Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic, signaled all options are on the table for the size of policy makers’ first interest-rate increase in March 2022, but Mester does not see a “compelling case” for a 50-basis-point hike.
The duo indicated they would like the central bank to begin monetary tightening soon, with markets pricing in more than five Fed hikes in 2022.
Some investors, including Bokeh Capital Partners Chief Investment Officer Kim Forrest, remained skeptical about such bets, arguing that inflation could ease as monetary policies are tightened.
Five to seven Fed hikes “is just so crazy, it’s a lot driven by bond people here who really just want to get that 10-year to the 3% rate, and I don’t know that’s possible,” said Forrest, who expects maybe two Fed rate increases in 2022.
The euro was up, boosted by reports that more European Central Bank policymakers were losing confidence in the central bank’s current forecasting and emboldened a shift towards interest rate hikes later in 2022. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will also speak later in the day."

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), however, will continue with its investigation into the company's public disclosures made after it was listed, Nuix said.
In an e-mailed response to Reuters, ASIC corroborated the announcement from Nuix, but declined to comment further. 
ASIC had suspected Nuix of lying in its prospectus ahead of the A$953 million ($684 million) initial public offering, according to a Reuters report last June citing court documents. 
Two months later, the company posted a worse-than-expected half-yearly loss. Last year, Nuix's shares also fell below half their IPO price of A$5.31 a share.
The regulator has completed its probe into the company's pre-IPO financial statements and prospectus, Nuix said in a statement on Thursday. 
Macquarie, which owns 30% of Nuix, has said it regretted the impact of the forecasts on shareholders and that it had no reason to believe the company could not meet them.
Macquarie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nuix shares rose 11.6% to A$1.685 in early trading, against a 0.5% gain in the broader Australian market.

Barclays found 21% of the retailers it surveyed cut ties with suppliers in the last year because they were not meeting required standards.
The most common reasons for cancelling contracts with suppliers were the use of unsustainable materials, unfair working hours and lack of membership of a trade body that monitors ethical and sustainability standards.
British retailers are grappling with international supply chain delays that are being compounded by labour shortages in domestic transport and warehousing networks.
However, Barclays also found that almost four in five retailers believe a long-term strategy to improve their ethical and sustainable credentials is more important than overcoming short-term supply chain disruption.
""We are seeing a marked acceleration and shift among retailers towards prioritising sustainable and ethical standards in every part of their business operations,"" said Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking.
""That is now starting to take its toll on retail suppliers with billions of pounds worth of contracts being cancelled every year.""

Johnson added that retailers must continue to improve their ethical and sustainability standards if they are to appeal to younger demographics.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 07:40PM ET</span>",Manulife and Sun Life earnings rise on asset management growth,"By Nichola Saminather and Sohini Podder
(Reuters) - Canadian insurers Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) and Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF) narrowly beat quarterly earnings expectations on Wednesday, driven by strong growth in their asset management units, but Sun Life warned that the spread of the Omicron variant will impact first-quarter earnings.
Government stimulus and pandemic savings over the past year have sparked a boom in the wealth and asset management businesses of Canadian insurers, helping offset the impact of claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The chief executive of Manulife, Roy Gori, said in an interview that during the quarter ""Asia saw the challenges associated with ... COVID, but over the full year, it had a tremendous performance."" 
Manulife's 27% increase in global wealth and asset management earnings helped offset declines in profits in Asia, Canada and the U.S.
Core earnings in the three months through December rose to 84 Canadian cents per share, up 13.5% from a year earlier and compared with analysts' expectations of 82 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Manulife, Canada's biggest life insurer, also saw new business growth across all markets. 
""Manulife came in ahead of expectations on the back of ongoing growth in its Asia platform,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst John Aiken said in a note. ""The recovery in profitability from the third quarter, increase in its book value, and outlook for 2022 should help support its valuation moving forward.""
Smaller rival Sun Life reported underlying profit that was largely in line with estimates, thanks to 15% growth in its asset management unit, to C$382 million. That, combined with increases in profits in Canada and Asia, helped offset a 51% decline in the U.S. business and lifted overall earnings 4%.
""The death rate in the working age-group was significantly higher in the fourth quarter in the U.S.,"" related to the Delta variant, CEO Kevin Strain told Reuters. ""Omicron has high numbers of infections, which is becoming a higher number of hospitalizations and deaths, and we see Omicron having an impact on the first quarter.""
Growth in Asia was partially offset by COVID-19-related mortalities of C$12 million, mostly in the Philippines. 

Sun Life's underlying quarterly profit grew 4.2% to C$898 million from a year earlier, or C$1.53 per share, compared with analysts estimates of C$1.52 per share.

According to the company's current assessment, there would be a shortage of at least 6.5 exabytes in flash storage availability. One exabyte equals one billion gigabytes.

Western Digital is working closely with Kioxia to implement necessary measures that will restore the facilities to normal operational status as quickly as possible. 
Kioxia, one of the biggest producers globally of flash memory and solid-state storage, is a key supplier to Western Digital. The two companies were in merger talks last year but they reached a standstill.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 07:06PM ET</span>",Treasury wants to stir up U.S. alcohol market to help smaller players,"By Andrea Shalal and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday flagged concerns about consolidation in the $250 billion annual U.S. alcohol market and outlined reforms it said could boost competition and save consumers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
New merger and acquisition scrutiny, different tax rates and lifting regulatory burdens to new entrants in the wine, beer and spirits market would make the market fairer for new brewers and cheaper for consumers, Treasury said in a 63-page paper.
The long-awaited report is part of a July executive order on competitiveness. Its focus on the beer industry, in particular, marks the latest push by the Biden administration to fight what it calls excess consolidation in industries from meatpacking to shipping.
Treasury, responding to over 800 public comments on the issue, suggested stiffer Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission oversight, tougher enforcement of existing rules and development of new ones in the report, which was first reported by Reuters.
""American consumers, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and workers should not have to suffer under the thumb of a highly concentrated beer industry,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter. ""Enforcement and regulatory authorities should have the courage to learn and the fortitude necessary to enforce the law and protect competition.""
The U.S. market for beer, wine and spirits has spawned thousands of new breweries, wineries and distilleries over the past decade.
But a web of complicated state and federal regulations, some dating back to the end of Prohibition in 1933, coupled with ""exclusionary behavior"" by massive producers, distributors and retailers means small entrants can struggle to compete and flourish, U.S. officials said.
""We're determined to protect what has been a successful, vibrant industry with a lot of small businesses entering it,"" while tackling issues that ""lead to excessive prices for consumers,"" said one senior U.S. official. 
The two largest brewers selling beer in the United States - Anheuser Busch InBev and  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) - account for 65% of U.S. beer revenues.
The Beer Institute, which represents those two companies and other brewers, said it was disappointed by what it called a ""mischaracterization"" of the beer industry and said beer prices had remained low despite rising inflation and a drop in demand.
But the American Craft Spirits Association welcomed the report's focus on the concerns of small independent distilleries, and said it should spark ""a fresh look at antiquated alcohol laws that are working against small businesses and curtailing access to our products.""
The report cited studies that showed so-called ""post and hold"" laws, which restrict price competition, mean beer consumers alone pay $487 million more a year than they should, could drive up the cost of a bottle of wine by up to 18% and a bottle of spirits by over 30%.
The DOJ and FTC, who share the work of antitrust enforcement, should take a closer look at proposed acquisitions of smaller players by bigger ones, Treasury said, noting that price benefits promised in past deals had failed to materialize.

The report also called for the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to change labeling rules to protect public health and to limit the impact of lobbying. As of 2017, alcohol companies reported 303 lobbyists in Washington.
U.S. states - which control the bulk of oversight - should examine the anticompetitive impact of regulations and franchise rules on small producers, Treasury said.

(Reuters) - Wall Street jumped on Wednesday, closing sharply higher as megacap growth stocks powered up thanks to a pause in rising interest rates, and upbeat earnings reports also encouraged investors to buy.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from multi-year highs hit in the previous session, helping steady sentiment across global markets and boosting demand for growth stocks.
Meta Platforms surged more than 5%, ending four sessions of deep declines that saw it lose almost a third of its value. The biggest boosts to the S&P 500 came from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), up 2.2%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 6.4%.
All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by a 2.45% jump in real estate. 
""The bond market basically is saying there's a cap or a limit to how much the Fed is likely to raise rates, and that is very positive for stocks in general, and especially for growth stocks that tend to be valued higher,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. 
Hit by worries about rising interest, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% so far this year after gaining nearly 21% in 2021. The S&P 500 is down about 4% year to date.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.86% to end at 35,768.06 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.45% to 4,587.18. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.08% to 14,490.37.
Investors will watch consumer price data on Thursday for clues on the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates. An unexpectedly strong jobs report last week raised concerns of a more aggressive move by the central bank.
Inflation is forecast at a four-decade high of 7.3%.
The U.S. economy may be nearing a slower pace of inflation, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Wednesday, though he added he is still leaning toward a slightly faster pace of interest rate increases this year. 
Of the 316 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date, 78% reported above analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data. 
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) surged 10% after beating profit and sales estimates, while KFC parent Yum Brands Inc rose 2.2% after sales beat estimates.
Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) Inc jumped 12% on upbeat results, lifting other solar stocks, with SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) Corp and  SolarEdge Technologies Inc  (O:SEDG) up 6.6% and 6.9%, respectively.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) slipped more than 5% after its earnings forecast for 2022 fell short of Wall Street expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 56 new lows.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 06:37PM ET</span>","Disney+ streaming growth, park revenue boost shares","By Helen Coster and Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -Walt  Disney  Co's Disney+ subscriber growth restored faith in the future of streaming video and strong attendance at U.S. theme parks added luster to its quarterly results, lifting shares 8% after hours Wednesday.
Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said he still believes the streaming service, home to hits like ""The Mandalorian"" and ""Black Widow"", will have 230 million to 260 million subscribers by 2024. The company added 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers in the first quarter.
And the company forecast stronger subscriber growth in the second half of its year than in the first half.
U.S. parks and resorts delivered revenue above pre-pandemic levels, but Disney expects international parks to be impacted by COVID for weeks to come. 
The company's overall revenue rose 34% to $21.82 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 1, topping analysts' estimate of $20.91 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Disney+, the company's two-year-old streaming service that is not yet profitable, kept revenue flowing when the pandemic disrupted its legacy theme parks, resorts and cruise operations. Its subscribers have grown 37% in the past year.
Now, the relaxing of government restrictions and pent-up demand has led to strong attendance at domestic theme parks as Omicron fears have receded. 
Excluding items, Disney earned $1.06 per share, blowing past Wall Street's estimate of 63 cents.
“This marks the final year of the Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Company’s first century, and performance like this coupled with our unmatched collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities, and unique place in the culture give me great confidence we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years,” said Chapek.
Revenue in the parks, experiences and products segment more than doubled to $7.23 billion in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, operating income in the segment stood at $2.45 billion, versus an operating loss of $119 million a year ago.
Disney+ subscribers stood at 129.8 million at the end of the first quarter, compared with Factset estimates of 129.2 million.
Investors are watching the streaming service’s growth trajectory as it relates to its ability to reach fiscal 2024 guidance. 
Disney has poured billions into creating new programming to grab a share of the online video market dominated by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), staking its future on a direct-to-consumer strategy.
Its much-anticipated ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" series will launch on Disney+ on May 25, Chapek said.
During the first quarter, Disney+ released the first episode of “The Book of Boba Fett,” about the Star Wars bounty hunter; “The Beatles: Get Back” documentary series from filmmaker Peter Jackson, and “Hawkeye,” about the Marvel superhero.

Disney announced in November that it would offer a bundle of its three streaming services, Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, for $13.99 per month. 
In January, Netflix forecast weak first-quarter subscriber growth, which sent shares down nearly 20% and erased most of its remaining pandemic-fueled gains from 2020.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 06:15PM ET</span>","Uber posts quarterly profit as ride demand recovers, delivery remains strong","By Tina Bellon and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday reported its second quarterly operating profit as demand for its ride-hailing service approached pre-pandemic levels and its food delivery business turned profitable for the first time.
Shares were up nearly 6% in after-hours trading.
The company's first-quarter outlook fell short of Wall Street expectations as the Omicron coronavirus variant dampens travel, but Uber (NYSE:UBER) Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said business had started picking up into February.
""While the Omicron variant began to impact our business in late December, mobility is already starting to bounce back, with gross bookings up 25% month-on-month in the most recent week,"" Khosrowshahi said in a statement.
Uber's earnings release came shortly before the company's first-ever investor day, to be held on Thursday in New York. Executives on Wednesday said they would provide more details on their long-term strategy and how Uber could expand its current business.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, Uber reported $5.8 billion in revenue.
The California-based company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, of $86 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, significantly ahead of analyst expectations for $62 million. 
That compared with a loss on the same basis of $454 million a year ago. It marked the company's second profitable quarter since it first reported positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter.
Uber's delivery unit, largely made up of its Uber Eats restaurant service, posted its first adjusted EBITDA profit of $25 million, showing Uber's ability to scale the once loss-making operation against strong competition.
Steady delivery bookings signal that the rebound in rides has not come at the expense of food delivery, with consumers sticking to the service even as the economy reopens.
Uber executives told investors on a conference call that the company was increasingly able to gain new customers for its Eats platform through its ride-hail business since the company merged its services into one app.
""The diversification is really coming into play,"" Khosrowshahi said, adding that its business remained resilient even during the Omicron wave thanks to delivery orders.
Khosrowshahi said the company had to improve its restaurant base in the U.S. suburbs to catch up with larger delivery rival DoorDash.
Rides recovery in the fourth quarter was driven by strong demand for airport trips, which tripled compared to last year. Airport rides are among the most profitable routes for Uber.
Uber also posted net income of $892 million, as it revalued its stakes in Southeast-Asian Grab and self-driving company Aurora Innovation Inc, just a quarter after it reported a $2.42 billion net loss driven by its stake in Chinese ride service Didi and stock-based compensation. 
The company significantly increased its marketing spend in the fourth quarter, upping sales and marketing expenses by 36% on a quarterly basis. Uber launched several large Uber Eats advertising campaigns in the U.S. market at the end of last year.

Uber forecast lower-than-expected adjusted profit in the first three months of 2022, as the Omicron coronavirus variant dampened travel demand in January. Smaller U.S. rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) issued a similar warning on Tuesday.
Uber forecast first-quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $100 million and $130 million, compared with analysts' estimates for nearly $150 million.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 05:12PM ET</span>",Mattel forecasts full-year earnings above estimates as toy demand holds strong,"By Deborah Mary Sophia and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) forecast full-year profit above estimates on Wednesday, with the company confident robust demand for its Barbie dolls and other toys will help it weather rampant supply chain disruptions, sending its shares up about 6% in extended trading. 
Demand for toys has surged to a record high over the last year thanks to homebound parents looking to keep their children entertained indoors during the pandemic, helping toymakers such as Mattel raise prices to counter surging costs without fear of much consumer pushback. 
Mattel's holiday-quarter revenue jumped 10% to about $1.80 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $1.66 billion, despite factory closures and supply disruptions caused by the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Even as supply chain bottlenecks and surging raw material costs show no signs of easing, Mattel Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz told Reuters he was confident the company had enough options to navigate the issues, including potentially raising prices further.
""We are not necessarily expecting supply chain disruptions to go away, but we do expect to be able to navigate further disruption if it comes,"" he said.
Earlier this week, rival  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) warned of a hit to its profit margins this year, due to surging supply costs. 
Mattel expects adjusted 2022 profit of $1.42 to $1.48 per share, above estimates of $1.39 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. It forecast net sales to rise between 8% and 10% on a constant currency basis.
The toymaker also lifted its 2023 net sales growth forecast to high single digits from a previous outlook of mid-single-digit growth.

An added lift to sales in 2023 will likely come from Mattel winning back the lucrative rights to make dolls based on Disney Princesses, with Kreiz saying he expects revenue from the toy line to grow past current levels.
Hasbro, which has held the Disney Princess license since 2016, has on average generated about $250 million in revenue per year from the business.

(Reuters) -  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) said on Wednesday it has created an artificial intelligence agent called Gran Turismo Sophy (GT Sophy) that was able to beat world's best drivers of the PlayStation racing simulation game Gran Turismo.
To get GT Sophy ready for the game, different units of Sony brought in fundamental AI research, a hyper-realistic real world racing simulator, and infrastructure for massive scale AI training, the company said in a statement.
The AI first raced against four best Gran Turismo drivers in July, learnt from the race and outperformed the human drivers in another race in October. 
""It took about 20 PlayStations running simultaneously for about 10 to 12 days to train GT Sophy to race from scratch to superhuman level,"" said Peter Wurman, director of Sony AI America and the leader of the team who designed the AI.
While AI had been used to defeat humans in the games of chess, Mahjong and Go, Sony said the difficulty in mastering race car driving was the many decisions that need to be made in real time. 
Sony's rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which recently bought Activision for $69 billion, has been using games to improve AI by offering up new challenges for AI models to solve.
Gran Turismo, a racing simulation video game, made its debut in 1997 and has sold over 80 million units. 

Sony wants to apply the learnings to other PlayStation games.
""There are a lot of games that pose different challenges for AI and we're looking forward to starting to work on those problems,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Consumers should brace for years of high energy prices, heads of top oil and gas companies said, in what would pile pressure on governments struggling with spiralling inflation.
Oil and gas prices have rocketed in recent months as a result of a rapid recovery in global economic activity as COVID-19 restrictions have eased, as well as a drop in investment in new energy supplies.
While oil and gas companies reported bumper earnings in 2021, consumers, particularly in Europe, have faced sharp rises in petrol, heating and electricity bills, which in turn have led several governments to introduce subsidies to ease the pressure.
""I've no good news to deliver, oil prices will remain high"", Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of France's TotalEnergies, told RTL Radio.
TotalEnergies will hand out a 100-euro ($114.20) voucher to help some of its lower-income clients deal with high energy bills, Pouyanne said.
European natural gas prices have more than tripled over the past year, after hitting record highs late last year amid low seasonal inventories.
""What we can expect is volatility over the coming months and years,"" BP (NYSE:BP) CEO Bernard Looney told Reuters on Tuesday after the British company reported its highest annual profit in eight years, prompting calls for the government to impose more taxes on oil and gas companies to help deal with energy bills. 
Oil markets could see supplies tighten more this year and further support prices which remain above $90 a barrel, their highest since 2014, Looney said.

TIGHT MARKET
Equinor , Europe's second-largest pipeline gas supplier after Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), posted record quarterly profits on Wednesday.
Its Chief Executive Anders Opedal said he expected the European gas market to remain tight, with demand to remain strong this year as below-normal storage needed replenishing.
""We expect a tight gas market going forward and we expect volatility in power price development,"" Opedal told a news conference. 
Europe's top energy companies plan to shift their businesses away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy and renewables and have slowed down investments in new oil and gas projects in recent years, partly contributing to current supply shortages.

Equinor expects its total oil and gas production to increase by 2% in 2022. BP's production is expected to remain flat this year compared to 2021.

Investing.com -  Doximity  Inc (NYSE:DOCS) shares rose 25% in Wednesday trading after the medical doctor digital platform posted strong earnings after-hours Tuesday and announced an acquisition.
Doximity reported revenue of $97.88M, a 67% increase from a year ago, and more than $10M ahead of guidance. The company also posted GAAP income of $.26/share and non-GAAP income of $.29/share, ahead of estimates for $.12/share.
The company also raised full-year guidance to $338.9-$339.9M, a more than $10M increase. Their Q1 guidance (the company's fiscal Q4 2022) was in-line with analyst expectations.
On top of that, the company announced the acquisition of Amion, which provides scheduling and messaging tools to nearly 200,000 physicians, for $53.5M plus up to $29M in earn-outs over the next four years. Doximity estimated that Amion had $5M of revenue in calendar year 2021.
“We had a strong Q3 led by our existing clients as our net revenue retention rate hit 171%,” said Jeff Tangney, co-founder & CEO at Doximity. “Our telehealth platform grew to 350,000 active providers and we agreed to acquire Amion which powers nearly 200,000 physician schedule. It’s our life’s work to build the physician cloud – a digital platform to help physicians save time, so they can provide better care for patients.""
The company also provided initial FY 2023 guidance (for the year starting in April), which entailed 33% revenue growth and 40% Adjusted EBITDA margins before factoring in any Amion impact.
Analysts looked at the beat positively, even though two bullish analysts - Raymond James and Needham and Company - lowered price targets, perhaps in reflection of the subdued climate for growth companies. As reported by StreetInsider, Needham's analyst Scott Berg wrote, ""Doximity reported its biggest revenue outperformance to date...Overall sales metrics remained positive including NRR of 171% (versus 173% in 2Q), $100k plus customers growing 50% Y/Y and spend at its top five customers up 90% Y/Y. While the (Amion) acquisition is primarily a product acquisition, we like the acquisition strategy as it continues to focus on expanding functionality to drive higher physician engagement which ultimately can drive higher marketing solutions revenues.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said on Wednesday it was bracing to pay as much as $3.6 billion in cash and medicine to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging it and other drug companies fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic.
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, this week reached a settlement worth $225 million with Texas, comprising $150 million in cash and $75 million in products.
Chief Executive Kåre Schultz told Reuters that based on that settlement, as well as a proposed nationwide settlement with three large drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) worth $26 billion, Teva would likely pay $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion spread over 15 years. 
Under that formula, the cash portion for Teva would likely amount to about $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion. 
""The Texas model is a good one because it satisfies the need for cash ... while still maintaining a significant portion of the settlement as products that really can help the people suffering from substance abuse,"" he said after Teva issued fourth-quarter profit that beat estimates.
Schultz said he was confident a deal could be reached in the next year. 
""It's difficult to predict when there might be a breakthrough,"" he said, but the Texas settlement is a ""good framework to use nationwide.""
Teva has long sought to resolve the opioid lawsuits by state, counties and municipalities it faces, offering in 2019 to donate $23 billion in opioid addiction treatment drugs and to pay $250 million over 10 years. 
Lawyers for some of the plaintiffs at the time questioned the true value of the drugs. On Wednesday, some plaintiffs' expressed scepticism about basing any national deal on the Texas settlement.
""Global extrapolation from a one-off settlement, particularly with an entity that didn't even file a lawsuit, is not always that clear-cut,"" said Paul Geller, a lead plaintiffs' attorney for local governments at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd.
Teva's New York-listed shares were up 8.02% at $8.96.
The drugmaker projected a flat to slightly better 2022 than 2021, as long as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
Boosted by gains in North American sales of Huntington’s disease treatment Austedo and migraine product Ajovy, the company earned 77 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the October-December quarter, up from 68 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell 8% to $4.1 billion amid a 25% decline in U.S. generic drug sales. 
Analysts had forecast Israel-based Teva would earn 73 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $4.29 billion, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.
Teva forecast 2022 adjusted EPS of $2.40-$2.60 and revenue of $15.6 billion-$16.2 billion, compared with adjusted EPS of $2.58 and revenue of $15.9 billion in 2021.
North American sales of Ajovy rose 49% to $53 million in the quarter, while Austedo sales jumped 52% to $282 million. Ajovy sales in Europe rose 121% to $29 million as the drug continued to be rolled out in many countries.
Teva projects global sales of about $1 billion for Austedo in 2022, up from $808 million in 2021, while Ajovy sales are forecast to grow to $400 million from $313 million, with both drugs expected to drive growth this year as revenue from multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone declines due to competition.

Schultz added Teva expects U.S. regulatory approval in mid-2022 to launch Risperidone LAI, a treatment for patients suffering from schizophrenia, and that over time, it will reach a double-digit market share.
Teva, Schultz said, is also interested in producing a generic version of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s Paxlovid COVID-19 medicine.

BOSTON (Reuters) -New York's state pension fund will sell $238 million worth of stock and debt it holds across 21 shale oil and gas companies including Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK),  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) and  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), saying they have not shown they are ready to move to a low-emissions economy.
However, the fund will keep another 21 shale companies including ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), CNX Resources (NYSE:CNX) Corp and EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) according to material reviewed by Reuters from New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees retirement assets. 
""To protect the state pension fund, we are restricting investments in companies that we believe are unprepared to adapt to a low-carbon future,"" DiNapoli said in a statement sent by a spokesman. A review found the companies being sold continue to invest heavily in high-risk and high-cost assets, a spokesman for DiNapoli's office said via e-mail.
Asked about DiNapoli's decision, a ConocoPhillips spokesman referred to recent statements the company has made about its environmental efforts, including that it has a focus on low emissions intensity.
The other companies did not respond to messages seeking comment.
A U.S.-pioneered method of pumping water, sand and chemicals into shale rock formations releases trapped oil and gas. Shale discoveries in recent decades have made the U.S. the world's largest oil producer and a top natural gas exporter.
The $280 billion New York State fund is not a major holder of shale companies, but as the third-largest U.S. state pension fund its decisions are closely followed as other institutions weigh whether to move away from fossil fuel stocks.
Last year DiNapoli said the fund would sell $7 million worth of securities in Canadian oil sands companies and start its shale companies review. Next it will review whether to take similar steps for big integrated oil companies. 
Some activists have pressured for more complete divestment and won over universities and institutions including New York City retirement funds. Maine state pension officials are developing plans to sell fossil fuel stocks as required by a new law. 
Several climate groups praised DiNapoli's action but said they hope for more share sales. In an e-mailed statement Jordan Dale of Divest NY called DiNapoli's action ""an example that other institutions can learn from.""
But the top pension fund, the $500 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), is not ready to broadly divest, said Simiso Nzima, its managing director of global equity, in an interview on Tuesday.
""When you divest you don't solve climate change, you don't solve the issues,"" he said. Rather, Calpers will likely vote against more company directors this year over topics like the environment or boardroom diversity, Nzima said.

In addition, some Republican state officials have opposed investor efforts to pressure fossil fuel companies.
New York will sell the shale stocks in ""a prudent manner and timeframe,"" according to the statement.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian bank UniCredit plans to sell around 2 billion euros ($2.29 billion) in impaired debts to bad loan specialist Prelios after halting a process to hire a debt recovery firm for the portfolio, three sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.
The deal will beef up assets managed by Prelios just as the group evaluates a possible initial public offering or a tie-up to allow its owner - U.S. investment fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management - to cash out, bankers said.
New York-based DK took Prelios private in 2018 after launching a buyout offer for the Milan-based group, which is one of Italy's leading bad loan managers.
Some 250 billion euros in impaired loans offloaded by the country's lenders in the past few years have turned Italy into Europe's biggest market for distressed bank debt.
A sale would lower UniCredit's impaired loans close to 3.1% of total lending, based on Reuters calculations, compared with 3.6% at the end of December when they totalled 16 billion euros. That compares with 61 billion euros in mid-2016 when UniCredit embarked on a restructuring.
Both UniCredit and Prelios declined to comment.
The portfolio comprises ""unlikely to pay"" (UTP) loans, which are not yet in default but are unlikely to be repaid in full, with an average size below 5 million euros each, the three sources said.
In December Reuters had reported UniCredit had sent out teasers to select a debt recovery firm for a UTP portfolio worth around 1 billion euros.
The sources said the selection process, known as Project Tiger, had been halted and the sale of the bigger portfolio to Prelios agreed.
With around 30 billion euros of impaired debts under management, Prelios specialises in UTP loans. In 2019, the company struck a landmark UTP partnership with rival banking heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY).
Intesa last week said it could strengthen that partnership as it works to whittle down its problem loans under a new strategy to 2025.

Recovering UTPs is more complex and costly than liquidating defaulted loans, often entailing debt restructuring, turnaround plans and new investment to return businesses to health.

481,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>","Even If This Is a Bond Bear Market, Things May Not End Badly","(Bloomberg) -- The question of the day is whether we’re in a bond bear market. After all, we don’t even know what one looks like. 
I was on record a month ago saying 2022 would see a prolonged downturn. So, I think the answer is yes, we seem to be in a bond bear market. That means there are two important episodes to keep in mind now: The 2013 “taper tantrum,” and the bond market massacre of 1994.
My interpretation of the taper tantrum is that bond markets were getting in front of an anticipated tightening in U.S. monetary policy, causing yields to spike and the weakest emerging markets to suffer. But, in 2021, when the Fed first started talking about tapering, it explicitly said there was no discussion around rate liftoff. So front running hikes via a “taper tantrum” didn’t make sense.
That changed late last year. In early December, I said that a taper tantrum was on the table for 2022, centered in credit and emerging markets. And we have already seen the initial selloff in credit. But, despite all the headlines and angst, things are tame so far. We’ve seen worse, even in the last few years, namely in December 2018 and March 2020. It will only become a “tantrum” if the Fed further accelerates rate hikes.
Then there’s 1994.
That year was a lot worse for developed markets than the taper tantrum. The Fed was more secretive back then, and totally surprised markets by jacking up rates soon after the slow, so-called “jobless” recovery ended. Friends of mine found offers from investment banks were suddenly rescinded. And people were getting sacked in droves on Wall Street and in the City of London. It was a very ugly period in bond markets and for job security.
But, if you look at Treasury markets, the ten-year path tells four stories. 
First, just like in 2020, there was massive monetary easing as 1991 began. Commercial property and high-yield markets languished, and the clean-up after the disastrous Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis was underway. Ten-year Treasury yields dropped three percentage points during that time.
Then -- just as in 2022 -- in 1993, policy changed overnight. But back then, the Fed didn’t telegraph forward guidance, causing ten-year yields to move up almost back to early 1991 levels. That’s a massive amount of tightening and not analogous to the taper tantrum.
Third, bond market carnage doesn’t mean recession. The Fed subsequently pivoted and yields came right back down. By 1996, we were 2.5 percentage points lower on the ten-year. That set the stage for five back-to-back years of 20%+ gains for the S&P 500 Index, and then for the equity bubble that later grew out of those gains.
Lastly, if you look at spreads, despite the decline in yields after 1991, there was a massive curve steepening. That helped banks rebuild capital, which aided recovery via credit supply. But notice that, when the Fed crushed the bond market in 1994, duration spreads collapsed and didn’t recover for the rest of the decade.
The moral of the story is that, while we’re having another bond bear market in 2022, it doesn’t have to end in a big crisis or recession. The taper tantrum was less destructive for developed markets than what occurred in 1994. And even in 1994, the U.S. avoided recession and went on to stellar growth for the rest of the decade. But of course, not all bond bears are created equal.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 01:55PM ET</span>",Biden faces Republican opposition in trying to fill key FCC position,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's nominee for a key seat on the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) faced extensive Republican criticism at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.
Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler when he was chair of the FCC under President Barack Obama, faced tough questions from Senate Republicans at a second confirmation hearing. 
Some Senate Democrats said that some companies and critics want to prevent the telecommunications regulator from acting on key issues. ""It is part of an effort to deadlock, disarm and disable the FCC,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said.
More than a year after Biden took office, the FCC remains split 2-2 between Republicans and Democrats -- preventing action on key issues including restoring landmark open internet neutrality regulations repealed under former President Donald Trump.
Biden waited more than nine months to designate FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel as the agency's permanent chair and to nominate Sohn.
Republicans have questioned Sohn's role as a board member of a nonprofit that operated a transmission service called Locast that was ordered shut down after four broadcast networks filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. A court filing said the networks were awarded $32 million in statutory damages, but Sohn and documents later made public show that the networks agreed to settle for $700,000.
If confirmed, Sohn has voluntarily agreed to recuse herself on some matters involving retransmission consent and TV broadcast copyright.
Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the committee, who sought Wednesday's second hearing, said, ""The public deserves a regulator they can trust to be impartial in all matters.""

Sohn said opposition to her nomination is ""about stopping the FCC from ensuring that the media is diverse and serves the needs of local communities....A deadlocked agency helps almost nobody, save for a few huge corporations. But most importantly, it hurts the American people who need the FCC to make hard decisions.""
The Senate committee is divided 14-14 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic U.S. Senator Ben Ray Lujan was recently hospitalized after suffering a stroke and is expected to make a full recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp on Wednesday announced a new set of principles for its app store, including open access to developers who meet privacy and security standards, as it began a push to win approval for its blockbuster acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard-deal-687-billion-2022-01-18 Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI).
The $68.7 billion purchase, announced last month, was the biggest gaming industry deal in history. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will file for approval of the deal in 17 jurisdictions, the company's president, Brad Smith, told reporters on Wednesday. 
Smith said he had previewed the app store policies with U.S. lawmakers and received ""a positive reaction."" He did not identify the lawmakers.
""Our goal is to build what's called a universal store for games,"" he added. ""In other words, a store that anyone can access on any device on any platform to purchase or download any game that a developer chooses.""
Rules for the app store were modeled on antitrust legislation under consideration by the United States and other countries, Microsoft said in a blog post.
""We have developed these principles in part to address Microsoft's growing role and responsibility as we start the process of seeking regulatory approval in capitals around the world for our acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"" the company said in the posting.
Other commitments made by Microsoft in the blog post were that its own apps in its store would be held to the same standard as apps from competitors, and that it would not use non-public information from its app store to compete with rivals.
It also committed to refraining from ""unreasonable preferencing or ranking"" of Microsoft apps over others.
Congress is now considering bills that would ban Big Tech platforms like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others from giving preference to their own products. Another measure would bar big app stores, like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s, from requiring app providers to use the platform's payment system and prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices through another app store or payment system.

Smith was in Washington on Wednesday along with Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella and Sarah Bond, vice president of the game ecosystem for Xbox.
With the Activision deal, Microsoft will take on industry leaders Tencent and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY). Sony Interactive Entertainment recently said it would buy Bungie Inc, creator of the ""Halo"" videogame, in a deal valued at $3.6 billion.

485,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",CVS forecasts COVID vaccine business drop of up to 80% in 2022,"By Leroy Leo
(Reuters) -CVS Health Corp on Wednesday said it expected a 70% to 80% drop in the number of COVID-19 vaccines its drugstores will administer this year and said 2022 profit would be driven by its health insurance and pharmacy benefit management businesses.
Shares of the company fell more than 4% to in early trading after the company left its 2022 earnings forecast unchanged despite beating profit expectations in the fourth quarter.
CVS made the comments during a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results, which exceeded Wall Street estimates for profit and sales.
The company, which operates one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, manages pharmacy benefits for employers and health plans and owns the Aetna health insurer, also forecast a 40% to 50% fall in COVID-19 testing at its stores. It said it expects ""modest full-year volume growth"" in over-the-counter test kits.
CVS said it administered COVID-19 vaccine booster doses during the fourth quarter that it had previously expected to provide in 2022, helping drive a near 13% increase in sales at its retail stores. That was also a factor in not raising the 2022 forecast, it said.
While some countries such as Israel have begun giving out fourth vaccine doses, CVS is not counting on booster shots boosting its business.
""Our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster,"" Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said on the call. 
""As such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year.""
Demand for COVID-19 vaccines at CVS stores shot up to more than 20 million during the fourth quarter from around 11 million in the preceding quarter as the U.S. booster shot campaign gathered steam.
The company administered over 8 million COVID-19 tests, largely similar to what it recorded in the third quarter. 
CVS' sales and profit beat in the quarter was ""more pronounced, due to stale and overly conservative estimates that didn’t align with guidance,"" said Baird analyst Eric Coldwell. 
Excluding items, CVS earned $1.98 per share, beating analysts' estimates by 5 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

Sales in its pharmacy services unit, which includes the pharmacy benefit management business, rose to $39.34 billion in the quarter from $36.36 billion.
Total revenue rose 10% to $76.60 billion, topping estimates of $75.67 billion.

Fuelled by North America - the fastest-growing region for L'Oreal - and mainland China, the world's largest cosmetics group's sales rose 11.2% on a like-for-like basis over the last three months of 2021 to 9.09 billion euros ($10.40 billion), beating the 8.74 billion euros forecast of analysts in a Refinitiv poll. 
""L'Oreal was firing on all cylinders in 2021,"" said Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive officer of the beauty giant, noting it outperformed the market which almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. L'Oreal sales grew 11.3% compared to 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak.
As sporadic lockdowns in China and surging Omicron cases in the U.S. disrupted traditional retail channels, online shopping grew to account for nearly a third of sales.
L'Oreal, which has been shifting resources to boost digital channels, touted record sales on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Tmall platform during China's Singles Day shopping bonanza in November.
In North America, where it gained market share in all divisions over the year, L'Oreal cited its new Maybelline Sky High mascara and Ralph's Club fragrance under the Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) label as performance boosters.
The company's spending on advertising and promotions, closely watched by investors, grew slightly over the second half of the year, resulting in an annual operating margin of 19.1%, a tad below the consensus cited by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts ahead of the results.

This year, the group behind brands like Kiehl's and Vichy expects to outperform the market, as well as grow sales and profits.

The move would result in 200 job losses and impacted titles also include EatingWell, Health, Parents and People en Español, Dotdash Meredith Chief Executive Officer Neil Vogel said on Wednesday in a memo to staff that was seen by Reuters. 
The job losses represent less than 5% of the company's workforce and the April issues of all six magazines would be their final print editions, the company said.
Dotdash had acquired the magazines in October in its $2.7 billion deal for  Meredith Corp , bringing titles such as People, Allrecipes and Investopedia under one umbrella. 
""Buying Meredith was about buying brands, not magazines or websites,"" Vogel said in the memo. ""We are very serious about investing for growth - in 2022 alone we will be investing over $80 million in content across our brands.""
Newspaper and magazine publishers have faced pressure in recent years from a decline in print-advertising revenues, while tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have pocketed most of the ad dollars in the digital space. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the industry's woes as it accelerated a shift to online news platforms, bringing newsstand sales to a halt.
Dotdash - the digital media arm of IAC - reaches about 100 million online consumers monthly and its collection of 14 media brands in health, finance and lifestyle are among the fastest-growing online media brands.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday Air China (OTC:AIRYY) agreed to pay a $143,000 fine over excessive tarmac delays in 2018 at U.S. airports.
The department said Air China had failed to ensure it would not permit an international flight to remain on the tarmac for more than four hours without providing passengers an opportunity to deplane. The department said under its $300,000 civil penalty order Air China must pay $143,000 within 30 days and must pay $143,000 if it violates the order within a year. The airline was credited with paying $14,000 for compensation to passengers.
The Transportation Department said Air China disagreed with how it calculated the civil penalties but said it has agreed to this settlement in the interest of avoiding litigation.
""DOT will hold airlines and ticket agents accountable when they treat consumers unfairly,"" said U.S. Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg.
USDOT said Air China allowed two international flights to remain on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York for over five hours without providing passengers an opportunity to deplane.

Last month, the department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers -- including Air China -- following the Chinese government's suspension of the same number of U.S. carrier flights after some passengers later tested positive for COVID-19.

The Treasury Department had said earlier it would consider dropping the use of ID.me, the private provider of facial-recognition technology, for identity verification.
All ID.me users will be able to delete their selfies or photos at account.ID.me beginning March 1, the contractor added.
ID.me has said its digital identity services are used by 10 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans affairs, and 30 U.S. states.
The Treasury Department initially began relying on ID.me and other third-party services due to the lack of funding to modernize IRS information technology systems.
""We have listened to the feedback about facial recognition and are making this important change, adding an option for users to verify directly with a human agent to ensure consumers have even more choice and control over their personal data,"" ID.me founder and Chief Executive Officer Blake Hall said.

(Reuters) - U.S. investors are snapping up funds that invest in dividend-paying stocks as they search for stable income from alternatives to bond markets, which are being roiled by the prospect of rate rises.
According to Refinitiv Lipper, investors bought $6.9 billion in U.S. dividend funds in January, the highest net purchases since October 2006.
 
Flows into U.S. dividend funds - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/lgpdwxqlyvo/chart.png
 
The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF and SPDR S&P Dividend (NYSE:SDY) ETF led inflows, receiving about $1.7 billion each last month, while First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF obtained $1 billion.
There has been elevated volatility in global equity markets this year on concerns over higher yields and inflation levels, which tend to squeeze corporate profit margins.
 
U.S. dividend funds with highest inflows in Jan. - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/xmvjojqrkpr/chart.png
 
Dividend funds are seen as safe and offering some stability in that scenario, as they hold well-established companies that have better pricing power and a track record of providing stable income.
""As a total return manager, we do look for capital appreciation when markets are doing well and rely on income from dividends to help when markets become volatile or negative,"" said Ryan Fause, a portfolio manager at Pinnacle Associates based in New Jersey.
""As we see growth stocks struggle and prevailing interest rates still somewhat low, we do find comfort in owning dividend stocks as a core part of most portfolios.""
Dividend funds' higher inflows were also due to the recent investor shift towards what are called value stocks, and away from the growth stocks, the latter referring to equities with higher potential which had outperformed during the initial rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Economists predict moderate growth this year, prompting investors to look back at stocks trading at affordable levels, or value stocks, which often also offer higher dividends.
Sectors such as energy and banks, which have high dividend yields, are expected to enjoy revenue growth this year, benefitting from higher interest rates and inflation levels.
""Value has been a strong performer as economic growth and earnings growth are starting to settle back down toward longer-term growth rates, and companies that are cheaper will do better than companies that are highly priced,"" said Gina Sanchez, chief market strategist at Lido Advisors in California.
Bond markets have been choppy after the Federal Reserve indicated a faster pace of monetary tightening and tapering of its asset purchases this year.
According to Lipper data, net sales of U.S. bond funds rose to $20 billion in January, the biggest outflow since March 2020.
""Virtually no bond funds look attractive right now. Investors looking for safety and yield are turning to stocks with low volatility and consistent dividends,"" said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Zuma Wealth in Los Angeles.
""Do we think this is a good direction? We say yes.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations, helped by increased usage of the futures exchange operator's interest rate hedging tools as investors prepare for central bank tightening. 
With the U.S. economic recovery in full swing and inflation surging, markets are pricing in more than a 70% chance of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and a nearly 30% chance for a 50-basis-point hike when policymakers meet in March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. 
That outlook has helped CME, which saw its average daily volume rise 26% from a year earlier to 20.5 million contracts, mainly driven by a 56% increase interest rate futures contracts, a 16% rise in energy futures contracts, and 15% growth in equity index products.
""We've got now five tightenings priced into the curve for the coming year. That's the first time I've seen that in a very long time,"" Sean Tully, senior managing director at CME, said on a call with analysts. ""Every single Fed meeting could be in play.""
The Chicago-based company said its net profit rose to $625.2 million, or $1.71 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $424 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.
Stripping out one-time costs, the company earned $1.66 per share, 2 cents above the consensus estimate of analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
CME shares hit a record high after the results were released, and were last up 6.32% at $256.68.

Total quarterly revenue rose 4.5% to $1.1 billion.
For the current quarter, CME said its daily activity in January was up 28% from a year earlier at 24.6 million contracts, with equity index and interest rates continuing to lead the way with year-over-year growth of 56% and 33%, respectively.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 11:52AM ET</span>","Private fund advisers to spell out fees, performance under new U.S. SEC proposals","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday voted to propose heightened regulations meant to scrutinize how private fund advisers charge fees to investors and measure fund performance.
The rule changes, which must undergo public consultation before they can be adopted, would require private fund advisers, such as private equity firms and hedge funds, to disclose to investors quarterly details about their fees and expenses, in a bid to shed light on the rapidly growing market sector.
An SEC-registered fund adviser, under the proposal, would also have to obtain annual audits for each private fund under management, as well as disclose so-called ""fairness opinions"" that summarize certain business relationships. 
The measures would also seek to bar advisers from activities the SEC deems ""contrary"" to the public interest and investor protection, while also prohibiting preferential treatment unless disclosed to current and prospective investors, it said.
Such contrary behavior includes an adviser seeking reimbursement or limitation of its liability for a breach of fiduciary duty and granting preferential treatment for certain investors regarding information about portfolio holdings or exposures, among other behaviors, the SEC said.
Armed with billions of dollars, such firms took advantage of what had been a record 2021 for mergers and acquisitions.
Private equity buyouts surged 133% to $818 billion in the first nine months of 2021 as investment firms rushed to deploy cash, often paying rich prices to take assets off the public markets, according to Refinitiv data.
Some firms banded together into ""club deals,"" in what some market watchers said could be a growing trend.
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said investors should have more insight into such mega deals. The SEC voted 3 to 1 in favor of the proposed rules at a Wednesday open meeting.
New rules are essential for private funds -- like hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds and liquidity funds -- because better visibility must match their growth in size, complexity and number, Gensler said of the sector that has nearly $18 trillion in gross assets.
""Beyond their size, though, these funds matter because of what, or who, stands on either side of them...the advisers, through the funds they manage, touch so much of our economy. It's worth asking whether we can promote more efficiency, competition and transparency in this field,"" he added.
FASTER SETTLEMENTS
Wednesday's agency meeting will also see commissioners vote on a potential rule change that would reduce the time between the execution of a securities transaction and its settlement from two business days after a trade date to one business day. The proposal would also mandate new recordkeeping and contract transparency between broker dealers, investment advisers and their clients.
The move would be the Wall Street regulator's most direct response yet amid a range of possible policy changes meant to address last year's frenzied meme stock trading.
Also, the agency will also bring to the table a rule proposal that requires advisers and funds to adopt and implement written policies to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Drew Maloney, who leads the American Investment Council, dubbed the SEC's proposals ""unnecessary"" and warned of the effect.
""We are concerned that these new regulations...will not strengthen pension returns or help companies innovate and compete in a global marketplace,"" said Maloney, adding that the private-equity industry ""works closely with investors to ensure they have the information they need to make the best investment decisions.""

497,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 11:46AM ET</span>",Unilever under pressure to show sustainability focus is good for business,"By Richa Naidu and Ross Kerber
LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Criticised by a major investor for focusing on sustainability more than financial performance, Unilever (NYSE:UL) CEO Alan Jope will be under pressure at the consumer goods group's quarterly results on Thursday to show the two can go hand in hand.
Unilever says on its website its 400 brands from Magnum ice cream to Sunsilk shampoo ""are on a global mission to do good."" Many back social or environmental causes, like recycling plastics in the case of Hellmann's mayonnaise. 
In 2019, months after taking over as CEO, Jope said ""brands without a purpose will have no long-term future with Unilever.""
But the company's sales growth and margins have been lagging rivals and its shares have fallen about 13% in the past year. That, coupled with a failed 50 billion pound ($68 billion) bid for GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer health business, has prompted some investors to question its strategy.
Last month Terry Smith, CEO of Unilever's ninth-biggest shareholder Fundsmith LLP, accused management of being ""obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business.""
Reuters spoke with a dozen Unilever investors ahead of its results. While most praised it for putting environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues front and centre for its brands, half said they hoped Jope would provide greater clarity on how it would balance this with financial performance. 
Jope has yet to respond publicly to Smith's comments. 
But the pressure could be building. 
It was reported last month that activist shareholder Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners had built a stake in Unilever. Trian has not confirmed this and, like Fundsmith and Unilever, declined to comment for this story. 
MIXED RESULTS
Madeline Wright, a deputy portfolio manager at No. 4 investor Lindsell Train, told Reuters that Unilever had managed to ""get their messaging right"" and ""radically increase"" the value of its brands. 
She was one of two investors to highlight Dove soap, saying the brand was worth over 4.5 billion euros, versus 2 billion euros in 2004 at the start of a body-positive campaign featuring women of various ethnicities and sizes.
But success across key brands has been mixed, according to the latest available data from Euromonitor International. While Dove soap's market share grew to 10.8% in 2020 from 10.5% in 2019, Hellmann's portion of the mayonnaise market shrank to 17.5% in 2021 from 18.3% in 2020, the data shows. 
Unilever is expected to report a 3.8% rise in fourth-quarter underlying sales, little changed on growth a year earlier, and lower full-year margins amid rising raw material, labour and transport costs.
Its exposure to certain foods and emerging markets - where inflation is surging - has put it at a disadvantage to rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) (P&G) and Nestle, according to some analysts. Unilever in late January announced a restructuring https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-cut-1500-management-jobs-strategic-overhaul-2022-01-25 of its business and plans to axe 1,500 managers.
It is difficult to know if Unilever's ESG initiatives have driven profit because the company has not spelled out how much they have cost, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Celine Pannuti said.
At an industry conference in February 2021, Jope said a commitment to sustainability was ""a driver of superior financial performance and lower risk,"" though he told Reuters Breakingviews in November that Unilever tried to stick to things ""close to our own business operations.""
But that hasn't prevented controversies. 
In late 2021, at least six U.S. pension systems - from New York State to Illinois - cut or limited their stakes in Unilever after its Ben & Jerry’s ice cream brand said it would stop sales in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, in a protest against Israeli settlements. 
Jope so far has supported Ben & Jerry's right to ""take decisions about its social mission,"" as a Unilever press release once put it. 

Dan Kern, chief investment officer of TFC Financial Management in Boston, which has about $2 million worth of Unilever shares, said the company needed to show it can keep its ESG focus while emulating P&G and Nestle, which he said had done a better job cutting costs and picking brands on which to focus.

(Reuters) - KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc reported quarterly comparable sales that beat estimates on Wednesday, driven by strong online demand for its tacos and fried chicken as well as new offerings across its restaurants.
To attract more customers, Yum recently launched special menu items, such as a crispy chicken sandwich taco at Taco Bell, a Detroit-style pizza at Pizza Hut and a plant-based imitation of its fried chicken at KFC.
Yum also bought three firms that focus on digital ordering, consumer insights and automation of the kitchen flow over the past few months.
""The (strong digital numbers are) evidence that those investments are paying off,"" said David Gibbs, chief executive officer, on an earnings call.
Yum nearly doubled its digital business from pre-pandemic levels, saying the growth suggests a ""more permanent shift to digital channels"". Comparable sales jumped 5%, topping estimates of 4.5%, according to Refinitiv data. 
""Taco Bell remains the crown jewel in Yum's portfolio,"" Cowen analysts said in a note. 
Same-store sales at Taco Bell increased 8%, while that of KFC rose 5% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting them to increase 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively.
Taco Bell has performed the best because the chain has been the most aggressive of Yum's top three brands in adopting digital technology, said Sam Zeitz, CEO of self-ordering technology provider Grubbrr.
Yum shares rose 3.5% to $129.30.
However, Yum's adjusted earnings per share stood at $1.02, below estimates of $1.09. 

Restaurants have been hit by higher costs due to record inflation and a labor shortage in the United States. Yum's total net costs and expenses rose 10% to $1.39 billion.
Chief Financial Officer Chris Turner warned general and administrative expenses would pressure profit in the first six months of 2022 before abating in the second half.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor, Domino's and other companies have found themselves in a diplomatic fracas after their Pakistani partners tweeted support for disputed Kashmir, irking Indians and highlighting the risks of operating in the region.
Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and arch rival Pakistan, each of which controls only parts of the Himalayan territory but makes claims to it in full. 
The row erupted after several companies posted messages on social media to mark Kashmir Solidarity Day, commemorated annually by Pakistan on Feb. 5 to honour the sacrifices of Kashmiris struggling for self-determination. 
The posts on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram outraged Indian social media users, who demanded apologies from the companies and urged boycotts of their products.
Others caught in the furore include Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) , the world's biggest automaker, Suzuki Motor, majority owner of India's top carmaker Maruti Suzuki, Honda Motor, Isuzu Motor, South Korea's Kia Motors and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM)' KFC.
The affray highlights the risks global companies face while navigating sensitivities amid rising nationalism in South Asia, and spurred some of them to tighten their social media policies.
POSTS WERE 'UNAUTHORISED'
While issuing an apology, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia said the posts by their Pakistani partners were unauthorised and misused their brands. The carmakers also put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.
Suzuki said it would advise business associates to comply strictly with its communication policy, which avoids any alignment with political or religious groups.
""In a flat world where social messages travel across borders, companies have to build in clauses and guardrails on what partners can speak about,"" said Amit Narayan, head of India and South Asia at risk adviser Control Risks.
Social media guidelines are usually for employees but companies will now need to set guidance and oversee how their partners represent their brand to minimise any risks, said Narayan.
India, compared with Pakistan, is a bigger market for companies and one where losing business can be painful. 
POTENTIAL LOSS TO BUSINESS
Hyundai, facing the most severe backlash, is India's No. 2 car seller. It sold nearly half a million vehicles last year and exported more than one million, making it India's largest car exporter. 
Hundreds of Indian social media users sought an apology over its Kashmir posts, and dozens said they would cancel their car orders. Even though the company apologised, it led to a rare diplomatic escalation between South Korea and India. 
Earlier on Wednesday, members of the youth wing of India's opposition Congress party protested outside a Hyundai showroom in the western city of Ahmedabad.
More than concerns about the government, global companies worry about how their social media communication in one country can affect their affiliate in another, said a communications manager working for a multinational in Pakistan. 

If there is a protest in India or a factory closure, it is a business loss, while the government can be won back at a later stage, said the person, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
""We can afford to hurt government but cannot afford to hurt an affiliate,"" he said.

Investing.com -- Shares of KFC-parent Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) traded 4% higher Wednesday after the restaurant chain beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates, driven strong demand for its tacos and fried chicken at its restaurants.
Total revenue increased nearly 9% to $1.9 billion as the pandemic-fueled consumption of fast food maintained its momentum. The company opened around 1,700 new restaurants in the quarter.
Quarterly same-store sales at KFC rose 5%, while those of Taco Bell were up 8%. Pizza Hut same-store sales rose 3%.
China was the lone market to see quarterly revenue fall from a year ago as the country ordered shutdowns in several cities amid measures aimed at containing the pandemic. Sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut fell in China, the biggest and the second biggest market for the two brands, respectively.
Yum has been experimenting with its menu, launching special menu items to keep fickle consumers interested. It has launched a crispy chicken sandwich taco at Taco Bell, a Detroit-style pizza at Pizza Hut and Beyond Meat’s plant-based faux chicken at KFC.
Taco Bell and KFC restaurants saw operating margins shrink, reflecting the industry-wide impact due to costlier inputs and higher costs of freight, packaging and labor. Pizza Hut's operating margin expanded by just 0.5 percentage points, eroded by higher inflation. As a result, at $1.02 per share, Yum!’s earnings fell behind estimates.

(Reuters) -Spotify's chief content officer Dawn Ostroff told advertisers at a conference on Wednesday that the backlash around popular U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan's podcast had been a ""real learning experience"" for the streaming service.
""We do feel that we have a responsibility to support creator expression, but also balance that creator expression with safety for our users and for our advertisers,"" said Ostroff, who has been a key driver in Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s work to turn the platform into a top podcast hub, speaking at an Interactive Advertising Bureau annual conference in New York.
The streaming giant has been under fire after Rogan, who signed a $100-million deal with Spotify in 2020, aired controversial COVID-19 views on his show and drew protests from artists Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and India Arie. Young said Spotify had ""become the home of life-threatening COVID misinformation.""
Last week, Rogan apologized and Spotify said it would add a content advisory to any podcast episodes on its platform with discussion of the virus. On Saturday, Rogan apologized again for using racial slurs after a montage video surfaced showing him repeatedly saying the N-word.
""We have been speaking to Joe Rogan and to his team about some of the content ... of his shows, particularly his history of racially insensitive language, and Joe decided to take episodes off of our platform,"" Ostroff said. She said Spotify does not have editorial control over ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast but that it supported this decision. 
Spotify's Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said in a recent letter to staff seen by Reuters that he condemns racial slurs and other comments made by Rogan but would not be removing him from the platform.
The controversy marks the latest instance of a major tech company facing furor over its content moderation practices. Social media platforms such as Meta Platforms Inc’s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), video sites like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have all come under scrutiny over the material they allow on their services.
Ostroff called ""the dilemma of moderation versus censorship"" the biggest challenge facing ""every single platform today."" She said there was no silver bullet but that Spotify's team was always looking to see how it could do better.

She also urged advertisers to participate and help in the company's evolution, saying ""we really want to be able to be good partners.""
Spotify has invested over $1 billion in the podcasting business. Last week, it posted higher than expected fourth quarter revenue and reported 406 million active monthly users, up 18 percent from last year, though its subscriber forecasts for the current quarter came in lower than Wall Street estimates.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Italy's UniCredit has backed out of a potential acquisition in Russia and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International has set aside risk provisions for possible sanctions on Russia.
What the region's banks now fear most is that Russia gets banned from a widely used payment system, bankers told Reuters, with one describing such a move as an ""atomic bomb"" for the industry because it would prevent the repayment of debts.
Here's what is at stake for Europe's banks as the crisis shows no signs of abating:
WHICH COUNTRIES' BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED TO RUSSIA?
Banks in Italy, France and Austria are the world's most exposed international lenders to Russia. Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.
(Graphic: Bank exposure to Russia, https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/zjpqkaowapx/chart.png) 
WHICH BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
European banks with subsidiaries in Russia are most at risk of sanctions, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) research. The investment bank's study pointed to a handful of banks, including UniCredit, RBI, France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), and ING of the Netherlands, as having notable exposure to Russia.
RBI said its exposure was manageable, while ING said it was well prepared. Societe Generale said it was closely monitoring developments and confident about its Russia business. UniCredit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
WHAT SANCTIONS CURRENTLY EXIST?
In reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and in the following years, the United States and European Union imposed sanctions that include blacklisting specific individuals, sought to limit Russia's state-owned financial institutions' access to Western capital markets, imposed bans on weapons trade and other limits on the trade of technology, such as that for the oil sector. 
Over that period, foreign bank exposure to Russia has more than halved, BIS data show. 
WHAT NEW SANCTIONS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
European banks are closely watching U.S. legislation to sanction Russia. A Senate bill would target the most significant Russian banks and Russian sovereign debt.
Meanwhile, in Europe, negotiators say they are ready to impose ""massive"" economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, but officials and diplomats say the threat depends on complex negotiations involving 27 member states that are far from complete. Negotiations are being held secretly.
In addition to widening the circle of Russian financial institutions that would be affected, measures are most likely to include efforts to keep Russia's energy sector from expanding, as well as blacklisting people and companies allied to President Vladimir Putin, according to Paul Feldberg, partner in the investigations, compliance and defence group at Jenner & Block.
""We are likely to see many more individuals and entities designated than we have seen before,"" Feldberg said.
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS?
A major worry is that Russia gets cut off from the SWIFT global payment system, which handles international financial transfers and is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. There is a precedence for such a move: Iran was banned a decade ago.
Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance expert at Frankfurt's Goethe University and adviser to the German finance ministry, said the short-term consequences of a ban are opaque, and might backfire. Long-term, it could lead to the buildup of a parallel system that would be ""a loss for the global system, and also facilitate conflicts further down the road as opportunity costs vanish"".
Heinrich Steinhauer, who represents the German lender Helaba in Moscow, said such a move would be tantamount to a giant debt forgiveness program by prohibiting payments, describing it as a ""sort of atomic bomb"". ""For many this would be a catastrophe. For many in the European Union and Russia, and less so for the U.S. because economic ties are fewer,"" he said.
WHAT ELSE IS POSSIBLE?
Financial institutions involved in swaps, futures, forwards and other derivatives that trade with Russian counterparties could also become subject to sanctions rules, according to Jonathan Moss, partner at the law firm DWF. 
A prohibition of trading of Russian bonds in the secondary market would mean that holders of Russian bonds might be forced to sell, Moss said. 
European banks oppose including Russian bonds in a sanctions package, said one person with direct knowledge of their stance.
WHAT ACTIONS HAVE EUROPEAN BANKS TAKEN SO FAR?
Last week, RBI said it had earmarked 115 million euros in provisions for possible sanctions on Russia, underscoring risks for European lenders as tensions flare. 

In late January, UniCredit dropped a potential bid for Russian state-owned Otkritie Bank due to the Ukraine crisis.
ING of the Netherlands disclosed last week that it has 4.7 billion euros in exposure in Russia, but only around 25% of that is onshore. Its CEO said the bank plans to remain in Russia and would act accordingly if any new sanctions arose.

Hui Ka Yan told staff in a Sunday meeting that the firm aimed to fully restore construction work across China this month, compared with 93.2% at the end of last year, with a goal of delivering 600,000 apartments in 2022, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter and media reports. 
Evergrande declined to comment.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer with over $300 billion in liabilities, has been struggling to repay creditors, suppliers, and deliver homes to buyers, epitomising a bloated industry suffering from the Chinese government's deleveraging campaign.
Hui said it currently had around 50 billion yuan ($7.9 billion) of pre-sale funds in escrow accounts to pay for construction, and a total of 170 billion yuan of cash yet to be collected from sales, as well as saleable resources to keep construction going. 
""This is not a chicken and egg question; it has to be first we fully resume work, and then we can restore operation, then we can repay different debt, and then we can get out of the woods,"" Hui said. 
He also said he was against fire sales to repay debt.

In 2021, Evergrande recorded contracted sales of 443 billion yuan, down 39% from the previous year. Hui's goal for December was delivering 39,000 apartments, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months.

Volkswagen shares rose as much as 7.2% while those in Porsche SE, which holds a 31.4% stake in the carmaker, were up as much as 8.3%, taking the top two spots in Germany's benchmark blue-chip DAX index.
They also outperformed a 3.7% gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index.
Traders pointed to a Reuters story fuelling hopes there could be news on a potential listing of Porsche AG at Volkswagen's annual press conference scheduled for March 15.
""That's when management will hopefully show their colours,"" a company source familiar with the deliberations about a listing told Reuters earlier.
""The situation is coming to a head,"" another person familiar with the matter said.
Volkswagen and Porsche SE, which will holds its annual news conference on March 29, declined to comment.
Volkswagen is still considering a potential partial listing of Porsche AG and has not made a decision, according to people familiar with the matter.

Sources told Reuters last year the Porsche and Piech families, who control Porsche SE, were weighing taking a direct stake in Porsche AG as part of a possible listing of the luxury carmaker.
""The move can't be about raising cash"" as this would be a sign of financial weakness, said Arndt Ellinghorst, automotive expert at data firm QuantCo, adding a spin-off of Porsche AG would be a ""much more elegant"" way to list the asset compared with a partial initial public offering.

(Reuters) -Bunge Ltd reported a stronger-than-expected 17.1% jump in adjusted quarterly profit on Wednesday as large oilseed crops in North America and Europe and strong demand for processed meal and oil bolstered its core agribusiness unit.
That strength would carry into 2022, the global farm commodities trader forecast, amid rising demand for food and biofuel and tightening crop supplies, although the segment would likely not match last year's record performance.
Shares firmed about 1% in early trading.
""We're carrying some good momentum in from Q4,"" said Chief Executive Gregory Heckman. ""While we don't see Q1 being quite as strong as last year, which was really extraordinary, we are off to a very good start.""
 Bunge  (NYSE:BG)'s results offered the latest look into how multinational grain companies have weathered shifts in demand and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bunge and rival agribusinesses are now benefiting from improving demand for food and renewable fuel as some pandemic restrictions are easing.
Traders, however, are facing higher raw materials costs as crop prices have surged due to a South American harvest shortfall, while energy costs hover near multi-year highs.
Forecasters have been slashing harvest estimates for Brazil, the world's top soy exporter and major corn supplier, due to adverse weather. Drought in Argentina has reduced harvest prospects there.
Bunge expects 2022 adjusted earnings of at least $9.50 per share, which the company said would be the second-highest in the its recent history.
The company posted adjusted net income of $533 million, or $3.49 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $455 million or $3.05 per share, a year earlier.

That topped a consensus analyst estimate of $2.87 per share, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Revenue totaled $16.683 billion, up from $12.61 billion a year earlier and above an analyst estimate of $15.167 billion.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 08:57AM ET</span>",Greece's fledgling tech scene starts to take off,"By Karolina Tagaris and Renee Maltezou
ATHENS (Reuters) - After years in which Greece was almost as well known for its financial woes as it was for its beaches, recent deals have highlighted a small but thriving startup scene that has grown up since the crisis.
JP Morgan's acquisition of a minority stake in fintech Viva Wallet last month valued the payments company at over $2 billion, giving Greece its first tech ""unicorn"" after a steady buildup of the sector over the past seven years.
That deal is expected to be followed up this month by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta's acquisition of Accusonus, a startup founded by a pair of engineers and amateur musicians whose audio software is used by the likes of Bob Dylan and Shakira.
Funding for Greece-based tech startups soared to nearly $1 billion last year, according to a report by Marathon Venture Capital, more than double in 2020 and nearly 10 times that raised in 2015, when Greece faced bankruptcy and a chaotic exit from the euro zone.
The deals have given a boost to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who has built on the work of previous governments and the EU with tax breaks and funding reforms aimed at diversifying an economy dominated by tourism and shipping.
""Greece is not just a country that relies on tourism and its wonderful beaches,"" he said as he toured Viva's offices last week, adding the government was optimistic that technology would be an ""increasing part"" of the country's GDP.
The Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV) estimates the startup sector overall stands at 6 billion euros, or 3 percent of GDP, without saying how much of that is accounted for by tech startups. It has set a goal for the technology sector to reach 10% of GDP within the next decade, Markos Veremis, co-chair of its innovation committee, said last month.
Despite the optimism, Greece still languishes near the bottom of the European Commission's 2021 Digital Economy and Society Index, scoring low on connectivity, internet use and digital public services.
Nowhere near other European startup hubs like London, which raised a record $25 billion in funding in 2021 according to a report by Dealroom, it also faces stiff competition from other southern European countries like Portugal, which hosts Europe's biggest technology conference, Web Summit.
But there is an increasingly active network of entrepreneurs and investors as well as employees with experience working abroad during the crisis years.
""What started as an underground movement of small nerdy communities is now front and centre in Greek society,"" said George Tziralis, partner at Athens-based Marathon, who sees technology growing to match shipping's 7% contribution to the economy over the next few decades.
MOMENTUM
When Viva was founded in 2000 under the name Realize, startups were virtually unheard of. Since then, what began as a software house grew into a fintech operating in 23 European countries.
""There is a great deal of momentum for the burgeoning Greek economy and Greek startups ought to take advantage,"" Makis Antypas, Viva Wallet's co-founder and Chief Information Officer, told Reuters.
The decade-long crisis that began in 2008 forced many young Greeks who expected to work for the state or family businesses to either leave for wealthier northern Europe or innovate.
Successful Greece-based startups now range from taxi-hailing app Beat, e-commerce platform Skroutz, and market research startup Pollfish.
Greece had ""raised generations of people who dreamed of working in government, or declaring themselves successful entrepreneurs by squandering public money,"" Panos Zamanis, vice-chairman of the Hellenic Startups Association, said. It took a crisis to shatter those stereotypes, he added.
""We are not yet in the position we deserve ... but we must not forget that our country was slow to enter the map of innovation and suffered from a dramatic economic crisis.""
Since taking office in 2019, a year after Greece exited the biggest financial bailout in history, Mitsotakis's conservative government has made digital transformation a priority. It has introduced corporate tax breaks and reforms to simplify setting up a company and issue stock options.
The improved environment has been reflected in high profile foreign investments including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s decision to build a data centre hub in Greece, and there are hopes for more.

Tom Smith, founder of GWI, an audience targeting startup which opened offices in Athens in 2018, said payroll taxes and national insurance were ""still way too high"" but he welcomed moves to make Greece more attractive. 
""When you combine changing sentiment, increased investment, changing tax policies and amazing lifestyle, it's a very compelling offer,"" he said.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 08:57AM ET</span>",Top European shippers warn freight costs to stay high,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Two top European shippers warned on Wednesday freight costs were likely to remain high well into this year, offering no relief to customers including the world's biggest retailers, though they said bottlenecks should ease later in the year.
Pandemic-related disruption and a surge in consumer demand drove up prices for shipping goods around the world last year, boosting profits for both container shipping group Maersk and freight forwarder DSV.
""Freight rates remain very high, volumes are strong and lots of shipping capacity is still tied up outside ports,"" Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou told a press briefing after the Danish company confirmed record profits for 2021.
Efforts to speed up the movement of goods have yet to solve the bottlenecks, causing severe delays at major U.S. ports with knock-on effects around the world.
""As the pandemic eases and more people return to work, the ships will be handled quicker in ports, which will free up capacity,"" Skou said. ""At some point during the year, we will see a more normal situation."" 
This view was echoed by DSV, the world's third-largest freight forwarder behind DHL Logistics and Swiss-based Kuehne & Nagel.
""A gradual reduction of the congestion could start in the second half of the year,"" said CEO Jens Bjorn Andersen.
He predicted that while shipping costs would have to come down, because low reliability due to congestion and delays did not match current high prices, they would not fall to the same level as before the pandemic.
""The high level of freight rates we have now is not sustainable for our customers. The quality and service we deliver as an industry is not good enough,"" he said.
Maersk said high shipping costs had prompted more customers to prefer longer-term contracts instead of relying on the securing container capacity in the spot market. 
""In the extraordinary market situation last year, we've had to prioritize customers who sought a longer-term relation with us,"" Skou said. For those relying on the spot market, ""the last year has not been fun."" 
Maersk, which handles about one in five containers shipped worldwide, expects operating profit at around $24 billion this year, similar to last year, but slightly below the $24.4 billion expected by analysts.
Its shares were trading 2.8% higher at 1108 GMT, but are down 11% since reaching an all-time high in mid-January.
Maersk hiked its dividend payout to shareholders to a total of 47 billion Danish crowns ($7.20 billion), or 2,500 crowns per share, versus 330 crowns per share a year earlier.

The company reiterated preliminary fourth-quarter results published on Jan. 14, when the company said a fall in ocean-going container volumes by 4% was more than offset by freight rates surging 80% compared with a year earlier.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor will pay out $10 billion to shareholders this year after it reported record fourth-quarter pretax profits, joining European rivals in cashing in on a boom in oil and gas prices and sending its shares to a new high.
Adjusted earnings before tax leapt to $15.0 billion in the October-December quarter, up from $756 million a year earlier and beating the $13.2 billion predicted in a poll of 23 analysts compiled by Equinor.
Thanks to high energy prices and disciplined spending, Equinor generated $25 billion of free cash flow last year - equivalent to Senegal's GDP in 2020, according to World Bank data.
""We are capturing value from high prices for gas and liquids with excellent performance and increased production,"" CEO Anders Opedal said a in statement.
The oil and gas industry saw a massive turnaround last year as markets overcame the pandemic-driven slump of 2020, with the price of European natural gas quadrupling and North Sea crude rising more than 50%. 
Governments across Europe are rushing to announce measures aimed at softening the blow of soaring energy costs on households.
Majority state-owned Equinor, which celebrates 50 years this year, said it would raise its regular quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.18 previously, and pay an additional extraordinary dividend of $0.20 for a period of four quarters, with overall payments amounting to $5 billion this year.
The company also plans to increase its share buybacks in 2022 to $5 billion from $1.3 billion in 2021, up from a previous plan of $1.2 billion, taking the total cash flow shareholders will receive this year to $10 billion.
European oil industry peers have also posted soaring profits in recent days, with BP (NYSE:BP) promising to increase its share buybacks and Shell (LON:RDSa) saying it will raise both dividends and stock purchases.
""Equinor delivers a set of results well ahead of expectations, especially in terms of shareholder remuneration,"" Jefferies, which has a buy rating on the stock, said in a note to clients.
""The planned $10 billion shareholder distribution for 2022 represents a 10% yield, which sets Equinor at the very high end of the IOC (international oil companies) sector range.""
Shares in Equinor were up 0.9% at 258.6 crowns at 1307 GMT, in line with the Oslo benchmark index but down from an all-time high of 271.25 crowns earlier in Wednesday's trading session.
Equinor's quarterly petroleum production stood at 2.16 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2020.
The company expects its oil and gas production to grow by 2% in 2022. 
Equinor also said it would sharpen its climate ambitions for the next decade, reducing net group-wide greenhouse gas emissions from its global operations - so-called scope 1 and scope 2 emissions - by 50% by 2030.
The previous target was for operations in Norway only and was a cut of 40%.
Some 90% of the new cuts will be absolute, Opedal said, meaning they cannot be offset. 
""The new ambition is aligned with the Paris agreement and a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. This is a significant step that will demand a great effort,"" Opedal said.
Equinor's shares have risen 68% in the last 12 months, more than double the rise in the European oil and gas index.

The company said it expected capital spending to reach $10 billion this year, versus the $9-10 billion seen previously. 
It cut the 2023 capital spending forecast to $10 billion from $12 billion, but kept the 2024 estimate unchanged at $12 billion and said it would remain at that level in 2025.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – CVS Health stock (NYSE:CVS) traded 2.3% lower in premarket Wednesday as the company repeated its annual guidance while trimming its expectations for cash flow, notwithstanding a strong close to 2021.
The pharmacy chain cut the botttom end of its forecast range for cash flow from operations this year by $500 million to $12 billion, but kept the higher end of the range unchanged at $13 billion. That equates to a central forecast of $12.5 billion, rather than the $12.75 billion previously estimated.
For the year, CVS administered over 59 million Covid-19 vaccines and more than 32 million tests to detect coronavirus. That effort allowed the drugstore chain to close the year with $8.4 in adjusted profit per share. The market expected the company to build on it since Omicron still lingers but CVS is sticking to its EPS guidance of $8.2 at midpoint of the range.
The company had in December warned of a decline in Covid vaccinations and testing in 2022 and executives told an analyst call that it now expects to administer 70% to 80% fewer COVID-19 vaccines in 2022 compared with last year. In-store diagnostic testing could fall 40% to 50%.
Total revenue rose 10% to nearly $77 billion on higher demand for Covid-19 tests and vaccinations.
The company administered over 8 million Covid-19 tests and over 20 million coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. during the quarter.
Pharmacy services revenue rose 8% to cross $39 billion on processing more claims, partially offset by pricing pressures.

(Reuters) - A nearly three-month long labor strike at Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s U.S. cereal plants is expected to dent profit margins already under pressure from steep costs driven by global supply logjams.
The strike kicked off in October at four U.S. plants that produce Froot Loops, Corn Flakes and other cereal brands, constraining the company's production capacity and forcing it to hire temporary workers.
""We believe the impact of the strike could well persist for several months or longer and require sizeable investment to repair,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Andrew Lazar said in a note.
Kellogg is slated to report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
Most packaged food companies are struggling with supply chain disruptions and inflation, but Kellogg faces the additional challenge of regaining momentum in its key U.S. cereal business, Lazar said.
THE CONTEXT
The strike accounted for nearly 20% of the cereal maker's business and saw around 1,400 workers demand better pay and enhanced benefits in a tightening labor market.
""(Kellogg) is now emerging as the company facing the highest input cost pressures in our coverage,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said.
Margins at packaged food makers including  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc have also taken a hit in recent months from rising costs of transportation, packaging and raw materials such as wheat, corn and edible oils.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that due to Amazon's increasing activity in the UK grocery sector it must now comply with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice.
The code applies to retailers with an annual turnover of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) in grocery sales.
Amazon does not break out figures for its UK grocery sales, so its designation under the code publicly confirms for the first time that its sales have crossed the 1 billion pound threshold.
The code ensures grocers treat suppliers fairly. It restricts firms from making changes to supply contracts at short notice and also requires retailers to give an appropriate period of notice if they no longer want to use a supplier and provide reasons for ending the contract.
All of Britain's major supermarket groups, including market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, are subject to the code.
“Households across the UK are increasingly using Amazon to buy food and other essential items,"" said Adam Land, senior director, remedies, business and financial analysis at the CMA.
""Today’s decision to designate Amazon helps to ensure a level playing field for companies active in the groceries sector as people’s buying habits evolve.""
Compliance with the code is managed by the independent Groceries Code Adjudicator.
A spokesperson for Amazon said it strived to build successful, long term relationships with its suppliers and looked forward to working with the Groceries Code Adjudicator. 
""We are proud to work with thousands of suppliers and offer a great shop window for their products in the UK and around the world.""

Amazon's UK expansion in 2021 included its first 17 physical stores in the UK - 15 Amazon Fresh food stores and two Amazon 4-star retail stores.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The negative impact of currency fluctuations on North American companies' third-quarter 2021 results fell from the quarter before and was at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2018, data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba showed on Wednesday.

The overhaul left analysts divided over whether Barry McCarthy’s appointment as chief executive officer will increase or decrease the likelihood of a sale, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Barclays analysts saying Peloton shares were at “day 0 of factory reset.”
The deal most comparable to Peloton is  Lululemon Athletica 's  (NASDAQ:LULU) $500 million deal for Mirror in 2020, according to special situations research firm United First Partners, which was priced at 3.9 times Lululemon’s projection of the target’s 2021 revenue. At that multiple, Peloton would fetch about $51 per share, United First said Tuesday. That’s 37% above Tuesday’s close of $37.27 and more than double the price Friday before the reports of M&A interest.
Still, that would be a big comedown from the stock’s 2021 high above $167. Peloton was a darling of investors during the pandemic when fitness fans, cooped up at home, flocked to its sleek gadgets and subscription services. The shares tumbled 86% from the peak as the outbreak eased, sending customers back to their reopened gyms. The stock recovered some ground this week after reports that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) were interested in a potential acquisition. 
“You think you know what things look like, but then that will change on a dime with the latest headline,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “How do you invest on that?”
In another similar deal, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) paid a roughly 70% premium for Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), which would imply a price of more than $40 a share for Peloton based on Friday’s closing price.
The rally of the past two days probably was driven in part by short sellers buying back stock after the reports of M&A interest. Almost 13% of the shares available for trading had been sold short as of Monday, according to IHS Markit Ltd. 
Peloton now sells at less than 3 times estimated sales, cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 4.6 times. A majority on Wall Street still remain bullish on the stock, with more than half of analysts tracked by Bloombeg rating the company a buy and the average price target of $42.81 implying a 15% gain from current levels.
Still, price targets are all over the place. Mario Lu at Barclays lowered his forecast Wednesday to $60 from $90, while Telsey Advisory Group’s Dana Telsey raised hers to $40 from $30. Peloton’s second-quarter revenue missed estimates and the company again lowered its forecast for 2022.
The stock gained another 2.8% to $38.30 in premarket trading Wednesday.
Tech Chart of the Day 
The recent underperformance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has supressed the valuation premium of the index relative to the S&P 500 Index. Still, the Nasdaq 100 remains pricey trading at a 27% premium to the S&P 500, well above its five-year average.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 07:46AM ET</span>",Toyota and Honda upbeat on profits as customers pay more for scarce cars,"By Satoshi Sugiyama and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and Honda Motor were upbeat about their full-year profit prospects on Wednesday as tight vehicle supplies caused by a chip shortage allowed Japan's two biggest automakers to charge their customers more.
The Japanese carmakers are also benefiting from a weaker yen that raised the yen value of their overseas earnings.
Toyota and Honda like other car makers are cutting output because they cannot find enough semiconductors amid COVID-related supply chain disruptions and competition for the key component from other industries, such as electronics. 
Lower production, however, means their customers are more willing to buy cars with fewer financial incentives that carmakers typically offer to lure them. 
""We are seeing a further 10% reduction in incentives in North America during the second half of the business year after they halved to $1,000 earlier,"" said Kohei Takeuchi, Honda's senior managing executive officer told a news briefing.
Toyota stuck with its full-year profit forecast of 2.8 trillion yen ($24.25 billion), while Honda upgraded its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 by 21% to 800 billion yen.
Still, supply chain disruptions and chip shortages will continue to affect operations, Japan's No. 1 and No. 2 automakers said, prompting them to cut costs in a bid to squeeze out more profit per vehicle. 
""We don't expect the imbalance in chip supplies to resolve quickly and the course of coronavirus pandemic is unclear,"" a Toyota official told reporters. ""We think that uncertainty will continue into the next business year,"" he added. 
Toyota cut its annual production target by a half a million more to 8.5 million vehicles, while Honda kept its 4.2 million target, though that was below the 4.85 million it was aiming for at the start of the business year.
Toyota's 784.4 billion yen operating profit for the three months to Dec. 31 was higher than an average forecast of 716.8 billion yen based on the estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data shows. 
Meanwhile, Honda reported 229 billion yen in operating profit for the quarter, also above an average forecast of 166.2 billion yen based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitive data shows.

On Tuesday, Japan's No. 3 automaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor reported its third quarter operating profit almost doubled to 52.2 billion yen as shrinking incentive payments helped it squeeze more profit out of fewer cars.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Lyft  stock (NASDAQ:LYFT) traded 4.2% lower in premarket Wednesday after its passenger numbers fell in the December quarter, overshadowing a first ever annual breakeven at the basic operating level.
The company reported 18.7 million active riders in the quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter, as the winter wave of Covid-19 again turned people off non-private transport, while the onset of colder weather hit demand for its bikes and scooters.
On a year-on-year basis, that was still up 49%, but ridership remains 30% below pre-Covid levels, according to Reuters.
On a year-on-year basis, revenue climbed 70% to $970 million, reflecting both higher user numbers and average revenue per ride. Revenue per active rider jumped 14% to nearly $52, an all-time high. According to Bloomberg, co-founder and President John Zimmer attributed this to improvement in the mix of shorter rides and generally pricier airport trips, which doubled from last year.
Lyft has raised its prices recently, not least to fund higher incentives for drivers, whose availability has dwindled during the pandemic.
Lyft closed the year with its first annual profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other adjustments. That totalled $93 million, a reversal from a loss of $755 million in the previous year. However, its bottom line remains firmly in the red, at $259 million - albeit that it substantially narrower than the loss of $458 million a year earlier.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) may not last for long, according to Deutsche Bank strategists.
A basket of these megacap growth and technology stocks trades at a 60% premium to the rest of the S&P 500 Index even though their earnings are growing no faster than the others, strategists led by Binky Chadha said in a note. The bank’s model suggests the premium should be about 40% based on the companies’ earnings growth, leverage and payout ratios, they said.
Tesla shares trade at 86 times and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. at 48 times forward earnings, scanning as the most expensive among the cohort of dominant technology companies in the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.
Chadha said he expects those valuations to dip either via faster relative earnings growth or price underperformance. He noted that average analyst expectations so far don’t point to growth beating the rest of the market in 2022.
Indeed, last week Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) both gave revenue projections below estimates. Those results met with contrasting extreme reactions: Meta stock saw a record plunge, while Amazon registered the biggest one-day market value gain for a U.S. company after sales in its cloud computing business beat Wall Street estimates and the company raised the price of Amazon Prime subscriptions.
Apple, Amazon and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are down less than 4% for the year even as a surge in U.S. Treasury yields dented stock prices of pricier technology companies. The industry rout this year follows an extended period of outperformance related to both pandemic-era growth and low rates.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 07:06AM ET</span>","Tesla recalls 26,681 U.S. vehicles over windshield defrosting software","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is recalling 26,681 vehicles in the United States because a software error may result in windshield defrosting problems, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Wednesday.
Tesla told U.S. regulators the error may cause a valve in the heat pump to open unintentionally and trap the refrigerant inside the evaporator. Tesla will perform an over-the-air software update to address the issue.
The recall covers some 2021-2022 Model 3, Model S, Model X, and 2020-2022 Model Y vehicles that may not comply with a federal motor vehicle safety standard. It is the latest in a string of recent recalls for the Texas-based EV manufacturer.
Tesla said it was not aware of any injuries or crashes related to its latest recall but NHTSA said it could reduced windshield visibility in certain conditions, which may 
increase the risk of a collision.
The company said it was prompted by complaints from customers in December over loss of heating performance in extreme cold weather conditions. 
Tesla on Jan. 15 released a software update to address the issue as a precautionary measure. After discussions with NHTSA and Transport Canada, tests were conducted to assess the compliance of new vehicles delivered with the software command.
Under scrutiny from U.S. regulators and some lawmakers, Tesla has been issuing a number of recalls in recent months, including many for software issues.
Tesla has issued at least nine U.S. recalls since October as it faces government investigations into its driver assistance system Autopilot and an in-vehicle game feature.

In January 2021, Tesla agreed to recall 135,000 vehicles with touchscreen displays that could fail after NHTSA took the unusual step of formally seeking the recall.
The agency said touchscreen failures posed significant safety issues, including the loss of rear view or backup camera images, exterior turn-signal lighting, and windshield defogging and defrosting systems.

(Reuters) -Britain's GSK forecast growth in 2022 after racking up 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in COVID-related sales in 2021, beating quarterly forecasts in its first earnings report since rejecting Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s bid for its consumer arm.
The results underscore a comeback for GSK in the race to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic after it failed to bring a vaccine to the market so far. The spin off of the consumer venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has also put the future in focus as boss Emma Walmsley faces pressure from activist investors.
""We have ended the year strongly, with another quarter of excellent performance ... and we enter 2022 with good momentum,"" Walmsley said. ""This is going to be a landmark year for GSK.""
The drugmaker is pressing on with the spin off of its consumer arm, home to brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkiller, after turning down Unilever's 50 billion pound buyout offer for the unit in December.
Some activist investors had called on GSK to give more consideration to a potential sale of the unit. They have also questioned the ability of top management to boost the success rate of drug development, where GSK has long lagged peers.
The company said sales in 2022, after the consumer unit spin-off, were expected to grow 5% to 7% and adjusted operating profit was forecast to rise 12% to 14%. This includes the boost from a settlement with Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) but not sales of its COVID-19 products.
Analysts had forecast group earnings of 120.8 pence per share, or a rise of about 8% from 2021, on sales of 36.28 billion pounds.
The company said it expected pandemic-related sales in 2022 to be at similar levels to 2021 but said these would contribute less to profit at ""New GSK"" due to lower margins on its antibody treatment, knocking off profit by 5% to 7%.
GSK shares were up 0.2% at 0845 GMT.
PANDEMIC AND BEYOND
Excluding the Gilead deal, which secured royalty payments from an HIV drug, from the 2022 outlook ""suggests a modest trim to consensus underlying operating profit, albeit management's guidance at the beginning of the year is likely to include a degree of conservatism,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
GSK's sotrovimab, developed with Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), is one of the few COVID-19 treatments shown to have worked against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, spurring demand. It was amongst GSK's top selling offerings in 2021. 
GSK has secured orders for 1.7 million doses of sotrovimab, including from the United States, Canada and the European Union.
Sales of sotrovimab, branded Xevudy, stood at 828 million pounds in the fourth quarter, up from 114 million in the third quarter and above market expectations of 774 million pounds.
Revenue from shingles vaccine Shingrix, a key earnings driver over past quarters, slipped 7% to 597 million pounds but still surpassed consensus of 548 million pounds. 
Adjusted earnings for the group stood at 25.6 pence per share for the three months to Dec. 31, while turnover rose 13% to 9.53 billion pounds at constant currency rates, topping a consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus of 23.8 pence apiece on sales of 9.49 billion pounds.
GSK said it expected key trial results in 2022 on up to seven future growth drivers including a long awaited read-out on a vaccine for the elderly against the common respiratory syncytial virus before the end of June.

Walmseley told a media call the consumer arm's performance this year was expected to be in line with the previously stated medium-term target for annual currency-adjusted sales growth of 4% to 6%. GSK will unveil more details at a Feb. 28 investor event.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 06:11AM ET</span>",Fed denies release of correspondence on pandemic trades made by policymakers,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request by Reuters, said there are about 60 pages of correspondence between its ethics officials and policymakers regarding financial transactions conducted during the pandemic year 2020.
But it ""denied in full” to release the documents, citing exemptions under the information act that it said applied in this case.
The disclosure of trading by two regional reserve bank presidents during the pandemic led them to resign last fall, and prompted Fed chair Jerome Powell to overhaul Fed ethics rules and request the central bank's inspector general to investigate.
The FOIA responses to Reuters for the first time quantify how much back and forth may have occurred over policymakers’ personal trading in a year when markets first cratered, then rebounded on the basis of both massive federal fiscal stimulus and an aggressive rescue effort by the Fed. 
Reuters requested release under the information act of any 2020 communication ""regarding the propriety of individual financial transactions"" exchanged between the Fed's general counsel or ethics staff and members of the Board of Governors, then Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan, or then Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren.
Fed FOIA officer and deputy board secretary Margaret McCloskey Shanks responded  to Reuters that staff had identified ""approximately 47 pages of information"" involving Fed board members and around 13 pages involving either Kaplan or Rosengren. However release of the documents was denied.
""The responsive documents contain predecisional and deliberative information, as well as information that is subject to attorney-client privilege,"" she wrote. There was, she said, nothing in the documents that was ""reasonably segregable"" and not exempt from release under FOIA.
Demands for more disclosure from the Fed about the ethics controversy has been widespread, with public interest groups and elected officials including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, calling on the central bank to release more details about policymakers' stock trading and the guidance or opinions provided to them by ethics officials.
Gunita Singh, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA exemption cited by the Fed is meant to ""protect agency candor"" so U.S. government staff and officials can discuss issues freely as decisions are being made. 
The response from Shanks did not detail what current discussions or deliberations warranted withholding the information. 
The inspectors general’s investigation of Fed trading during the pandemic is still underway. The Fed is also still finalizing the procedures and rules for the new ethics regulations adopted because of the controversy.
The Fed has released the substance of one email sent from its ethics office to policymakers at the height of the crisis. In late October, after a New York Times report, the Fed released a March 23, 2020, email from its ethics officer which noted that Fed rules were meant to avoid even the appearance that officials used their access to market moving information for personal profit.
Policymakers were advised to ""consider observing a trading blackout and avoid making unnecessary securities transactions for at least the next several months,"" or until Fed meetings and decisions moved back to normal from the emergency footing of that spring.    

The ethics scandal blindsided the Fed last fall after reports in the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg about Kaplan's active trading in stocks during the pandemic and Rosengren's investment in real estate securities. 
That activity was noted in the annual financial disclosure reports that Fed policymakers are required to file. Both officials initially responded that their trades complied with Fed ethics rules, but said they planned to divest nevertheless. They eventually resigned.

NEW YORK/MILAN (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms is struggling to stop counterfeiters from pushing fake luxury goods from Gucci to Chanel across its social media apps, according to research and interviews, as the company barrels into ecommerce.
Its platforms have emerged as hot spots for counterfeit offenders who exploit their range of social and private messaging tools to reach users, according to interviews with academics, industry groups and counterfeit investigators, who likened brands' attempts at policing services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as a game of ""whack-a-mole.""
""Facebook and Instagram are the key marketplaces where counterfeit goods get sold to members of the public. It used to be eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) 10 years ago, and Amazon five years ago,"" said Benedict Hamilton, a managing director at Kroll, a private investigation company hired by brands hurt by counterfeiting and smuggling. 
Research, led by social media analytics firm Ghost Data and shared exclusively with Reuters https://ghostdata.io/report/Upd-Meta-Counterfeit-Empire1221.pdf, showed counterfeiters hawking imitations of luxury brands including Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Chanel. 
It identified more than 26,000 active counterfeiters' accounts operating on Facebook in a June-October 2021 study, the first time its counterfeit research had focused on Meta's flagship app, and it found more than 20,000 active counterfeiters' accounts on Instagram, up from its count the previous year but down from a 2019 peak when they identified about 56,000 accounts. About 65% of the accounts found in 2021 were based in China, followed by 14% in Russia and 7.5% in Turkey.
Ghost Data is an Italian analytics firm founded by cybersecurity expert Andrea Stroppa, who is also a data analyst consultant for the World Economic Forum. The firm has a track record of exposing the use of social media by counterfeiters, Islamic State supporters and for digital propaganda.
A Reuters search of keywords identified dozens of Instagram accounts and Facebook posts that appeared to promote counterfeit goods, which Meta removed for violating its rules after Reuters flagged them.
Online commerce is a key priority for Meta, which has pushed new shopping features that could help grow its revenue as it faces pressures like ads tracking changes and sputtering user growth https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-forecasts-q1-revenue-below-estimates-2022-02-02, and has signaled a hard stance against counterfeiters. Instagram said luxury brands like Dior, Balenciaga and Versace had adopted shopping features on its app and said some like Oscar De La Renta and Balmain were using in-app checkout.
But users exploiting its platforms to sell fake goods present a persistent problem for the company, which also faces scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators about its content moderation. 
""The sale of counterfeits and fraud is a problem that has always persisted with new technology,"" said a Meta company spokesperson in a statement. ""We are getting better every day at stopping these sales and cracking down on fraudsters,"" the person added.

Most buyers know they are not getting the real deal when they pay $100 for a handbag that retails for over $5,000. But harms include hits to brands' sales and reputation, potential safety issues of unregulated goods, and ties between counterfeiting and organized criminal activity, experts said. 
Meta has joined ecommerce sites and online marketplaces in grappling with the sale of counterfeit goods. But unlike public listings on sites dedicated to shopping like eBay and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), social platforms also provide offenders multiple channels to post in closed spaces, send private messages and use disappearing content like Instagram Stories, experts said.
""They're creating a lot of unique opportunities for counterfeiters to hide,"" said Lara Miller, vice president of corporate strategy at the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition. ""We're all playing catch-up."" 
Counterfeiters took advantage of features like WhatsApp product catalogs, which are unencrypted and available through the app's ""business profile"" option, to show their wares, the Ghost Data report said.
Ghost Data's Stroppa said he had seen an increasing trend of whole counterfeit transactions occurring on the company's platforms, rather than linking out to external sites. 
Some high-end labels remain wary of the ability of a broad spectrum of major online platforms, from ecommerce sites to social apps, to deal with counterfeiters. 
In 2020, Chanel, Lacoste and Gant left a European Commission initiative aimed at increasing cooperation between brands and sites including eBay,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Facebook's Marketplace to fight counterfeiting, saying it was not effective.
Chanel finance chief, Philippe Blondiaux, said in an interview last year that Chanel, which only sells cosmetics and perfume online, did not believe Facebook or Instagram were ""the right environment to sell luxury items,"" adding the brand wanted a ""very protected"" and intimate environment for its customers. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which estimated the global trade in counterfeit products was as much as $464 billion in 2019 https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/74c81154-en/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/74c81154-en, has said a boom in ecommerce in 2020-21 led to massive growth in the supply of online counterfeit goods. Academics said the fraud had mushroomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, while legislation in the United States and European Union remained unable to combat it.
Chanel, Gucci and Prada said their fight against counterfeiters resulted in hundreds of thousands of social media posts taken down last year, but did not comment specifically on Meta's services. Vuitton and Fendi owner LVMH, which in a filing said it spent $33 million to fight counterfeiting in 2020, declined to comment.
According to a lawsuit Meta filed with Gucci last year, the platform has struggled since 2015 to shut down a woman in Moscow accused of selling fake goods on is services via a network of more than 150 accounts. 
BATTLING COUNTERFEITERS 
Meta having more user shopping data https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/facebook-expands-shops-whatsapp-marketplace-commerce-updates-2021-06-22 could help with ad targeting, filling an information vacuum left after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started letting owners of its devices block companies from accessing user information. 
Meta legal directors told Reuters that cracking down on counterfeiters was key as its commerce plans ramped up. ""As commerce has become a strategic priority for the company and as we've been building new shopping experiences, we've recognized that we want to make sure those experiences are safe and trusted for brands and for the users,"" Meta's director and associate general counsel for IP Mark Fiore said last summer.

Meta, which says it has 3.59 billion monthly active users across its apps, in October launched an updated tool for brands to search and report counterfeits in posts, ads or commerce features, and says it typically responds to complaints of such infringements within 24 hours.
In a recent report https://transparency.fb.com/data/intellectual-property/notice-and-takedown/facebook, the company said it removed 1.2 million pieces of counterfeit Facebook content, including accounts, reported to it from January to June 2021 and about half a million on Instagram. The company said in this period it also proactively removed 283 million pieces of Facebook content violating counterfeit or copyright infringement rules and about 3 million on Instagram, either before they were reported by brands or before they went live.

The FT said the investors were concerned about Schwan leading pharmaceuticals and diagnostics group Roche, where he is chief executive, while at the same time acting as the vice-chair of Switzerland's second largest bank.
Some investors, who were among the 10 biggest shareholders in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said they will try to block any move to extend the tenure Schwan, who has been vice chair at the bank since April 2017, the FT said, without naming them. 
Both Credit Suisse, which is due to report its results on Thursday, and Roche declined to comment on the report.
Over the course of Schwan's time at Credit Suisse its share price has slumped by 64% after the bank became embroiled in a string of scandals and losses.
Schwan, who joined the board of Credit Suisse in 2014, is also the lead independent director and had intended to leave before the bank's annual meeting in April, the newspaper said, citing three people familiar with the matter.
But he has been asked to stay by other board members to maintain stability under new chair, Axel Lehmann, who took charge last month after the abrupt exit of Antonio Horta-Osorio over breaches of coronavirus quarantine rules.
""If he's up for election there will be a fight,"" one top 10 shareholder was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
""His role as Roche CEO does not benefit Credit Suisse . . . he should (leave Credit Suisse) and go on to another board,"" another top 10 shareholder was quoted by the FT as saying.

Schwan told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger in January that he was undecided whether to stand for re-election at Credit Suisse's annual shareholder meeting on April 29. 
""The task now is to stabilise the bank, and I am happy to support the new chairman in this,"" he added.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Xpeng stock (NYSE:XPEV) traded 5.2% higher in premarket Wednesday on inclusion of the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares in a trading link to mainland China known as the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.
The move should expand the company’s investor base as mainland Chinese investors will now have easier access to the shares of the maker of electric vehicles. Those shares closed 8% higher in Hong Kong.
“The inclusion will not only further expand and diversify our investor base but also provide the opportunity for our customers, partners and EV and technology investors in China to participate in our exciting growth story,” President Brian Gu said in a statement.
The company went public in the U.S in 2020, and within a year of that, listed in Hong Kong as well. The Hong Kong shares of the company are fungible with its ADRs.
It competes with Nio (NYSE:NIO) in the Chinese market. Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is the third player in the world’s largest market for EVs, where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are also active.
Xpeng sold 12,922 vehicles in January, a 115% rise year-over-year. As such it overtook Nio, whose sales grew by only 34% to 9,652 vehicles in the same period."

""The result for the quarter is the best in the 150-year history of the bank,"" CEO Carina Akerstrom told a news conference. 
Operating earnings rose to 6.37 billion crowns ($697.43 million) from 5.38 billion a year earlier.
""However, including its Danish and Finnish operations, which the bank is due to exit, the rival of Swedbank, SEB and Finland's Nordea reported an operating profit of 6.53 billion crowns in the quarter, above expectations.
The mean analyst forecast, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, was 6.40 billion.
The bank proposed dividend for 2021 of 5.00 crowns per share, below the 7.28 crowns expected by analysts the data showed.
Shares in the bank were down 1.3% at 0919 GMT, underperforming the European banking index, which was flat. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note that the dividend was a disappointment and would likely weigh on the share price. 
A strong recovery for the Swedish economy from the initial waves of the pandemic was jarred by the onset of Omicron late last year, but booster shots and milder symptoms have allowed authorities to quickly drop restrictions, nearly all of which were lifted on Wednesday.
Handelsbanken, whose main markets are Sweden, Norway and Britain, said its net interest income - including its Danish and Finnish arms - rose to 8.11 billion crowns from 7.86 billion, topping the 7.89 billion expected by analysts.
Commission income, boosted by brisk business and M&A activity over the past year, climbed to 3.47 billion crowns from 2.88 billion and beating the 3.11 billion seen by analysts.

Handelsbanken, whose low-risk, decentralised business model helped it weather the pandemic well, said net credit losses narrowed to virtually zero while spending rose slightly, primarily due to development costs booked in the quarter.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Smurfit Kappa expects to increase prices further this year to recover high costs after bumper demand and a 19% jump in prices charged for packaging products delivered record earnings amid ""unprecedented cost inflation"" in 2021.
Europe's largest paper packaging producer predicted last July that inflation was here to stay and Chief Executive Tony Smurfit told Reuters on Wednesday that it increased prices by 6% quarter-on-quarter from October to December. 
Momentum in price increases will continue into the first half, he added, with energy prices still at ""silly high"" levels and no indication that demand for packaging is slowing down across the global economy.
""If anything, it's the opposite,"" Smurfit said in a telephone interview, referring to the demand that he said will be boosted by continued fiscal stimulus in 2022. 
""The thing that I'm a little bit concerned about is that the supply chain disruptions have not gone away and when there is going to be growth, we're going to see continued disruption to the supply chain."" 
Smurfit, whose customers include Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Nestle, said its product range remains effectively sold out in each of the 36 countries it operates in with the exception of Brazil.
Exceptional demand for packaging used in e-commerce helped push Smurfit's core earnings back above pre-pandemic levels to a record 1.7 billion euros ($1.94 billion), up 13% year on year and above the 1.67 billion forecast by 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Analysts at Davy Stockbrokers said they were raising their 2022 earnings forecast by 4% to 1.95 billion euros, noting the confidence shown by a 10% increase in Smurfit's final dividend.
The Irish group expects its profit margins to improve this year. Its EBITDA margin fell to 16.8% last year from 17.7% in 2020 after the increasing price of recovered fibre - a key raw material in boxes - cost an additional 440 million euros and energy costs rose by 235 million euros.
Smurfit Kappa's share price was 2.2% higher at 47.9 euros at 0830 GMT.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp said on Wednesday there was no link between  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) registering a U.S. share facility and any specific plans to sell down its stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant.
SoftBank's shares jumped almost 6% in Tokyo, while Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares were up almost 7%. 
""The registration of the ADR conversion facility, including its size, is not tied to any specific future transaction by SBG,"" SoftBank said in a statement to Reuters.
SoftBank has previously used its Alibaba shares as collateral for loans and trimmed its stake using derivatives to capture upside from any rise in the company's stock price.
After Alibaba last week filed to register an additional 1 billion American Depository Shares (ADS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts had said this might ""suggest potential selling intention by SoftBank"".
In a fresh research note on Wednesday, Citi said Alibaba might have registered in advance a large number of ADS to support future plans of shareholders to convert the company's Hong Kong stocks to those listed in New York.
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told analysts he was ""surprised"" and had not requested the Alibaba filing, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.
Despite its 25% stake in Alibaba being worth about $82 billion, SoftBank is valued at just $84 billion and there has been speculation that the Japanese firm may monetize more of the holding, which began with a $20 million investment in 2000. 
Alibaba's shares have fallen about 60% from highs in October 2020, amid a regulatory crackdown against tech firms in China. 
SoftBank's fund raising plans were dealt a major setback this week after it abandoned plans to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The group is still investing through its Vision Fund unit and buying back shares. 

SoftBank's shares are down by about half from highs in March last year. The group squeezed out a profit in the October-December quarter after an upswing in valuations in Vision Fund's private assets offset falling shares in its listed portfolio. 
The group's loan-to-value ratio is being closely watched after it rose to 22% from 19% three months earlier as the net value of SoftBank's assets fell and debt rose. Son has pledged to keep the ratio below 25% in normal times.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Chipotle Mexican Grill stock (NYSE:CMG) surged 6.5% in premarket trading Wednesday after the burrito chain overcame higher raw material costs and a labor crunch to beat earnings estimates in the fourth quarter.
Total revenue rose 22% to $2 billion, thanks to its ability to pass on higher costs for beef, avocados and freight to consumers. Price increases also helped tackle higher packaging and freight costs, putting Chipotle among the few who successfully navigated those challenges at a time when McDonald’s MCD and Starbucks SBUX missed profit estimates.
Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol as saying there has been ""no resistance"" to higher prices. As such, operating margin expanded by 0.7 percentage point to 20.2% at the restaurant level, according to the company.
Comparable restaurant sales were up more than 15%, while digital channels grew in importance to account for nearly 42% of total sales. Adjusted profit per share was up 60% at $5.58, helped by lower impairment costs compared to last year.
Chipotle expects sales growth to slow to around 8% in the current quarter. However, it raised its medium-term target for opening new locations in North America to at least 7,000 versus 6,000 earlier -- saying it want to expand particularly in smaller towns.

The pan-Nordic insurer reported a pretax profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), compared with a loss of 675 million in the same quarter a year earlier, beating the mean estimate of 998 million euros in a poll provided by the company.
October-December profit before taxes amounted to 452 million euros excluding one-offs from Sampo significantly reducing its holding in pan-Nordic bank Nordea to focus on the insurance business.
Sampo is still Nordea's largest owner with 6.2% of shares and it gave no time frame for the sale of its remaining stake.
The insurer has also yet to announce what it will do with the capital it will get from selling off Nordea.
Sampo said the group's combined ratio for its property and casualty (P&C) insurance business improved 2 percentage points to 81.4% in 2021, beating the mean estimate of 82.8%. A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
""The result was supported by excellent profitability in our largest subsidiary, If P&C, which achieved a combined ratio of 81.3 per cent and underwriting profit of 891 million euros in 2021, representing growth of 15% year-on-year excluding COVID-19 effects,"" Sampo's Chief Executive Torbjorn Magnusson said in a statement.
In December, Sampo increased to 100% its holding in UK-based insurer Hastings, which underperformed in the quarter compared with Sampo's Nordic businesses, which all beat market expectations.
Hastings' fourth-quarter profit before taxes amounted to 11 million euros; analysts had on average expected 36 million.
""Hastings remained disciplined in the face of high price competition in the UK motor insurance market,"" Sampo said. 

Sampo's board proposed a dividend of 4.10 euros per share, including an insurance dividend of 1.70 euros per share.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -ABN Amro shares fell 4% on Wednesday morning, even though the Dutch bank reported higher-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter and announced a 500 million euro ($570 million) share buyback.
Net profit jumped to 552 million euros in the final three months of 2021 from 54 million euros a year earlier, easily beating the average analysts' expectation of 451 million euros.
""ABN reported strong beats on net profit and capital (but) the share buyback of 500 million euros is below our expectations of 800 million and the market's at 900 million to 1 billion,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said in a note.
""500 million euros will allow us to have multiple share buybacks over time"", Chief Executive Robert Swaak told reporters. ""It also allows us to become predictable in the way we return our capital.""
ABN shares traded down 3.9% at 14.65 euros at 0855 GMT in Amsterdam. They are up around 75% from a year ago, but remain slightly below their pre-pandemic level.
Although ABN Amro was re-privatized in 2015, the Dutch state which acquired the bank during the 2008 financial crisis still owns 56% of the shares and hasn't sold any since September 2017.
Finance minister Sigrid Kaag has said she will explore ways to reduce the government's stake in the coming years, without giving further details.
ABN's net profit was helped by the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures in the Netherlands, which improved the financial health of ABN Amro's clients in the last months of last year, while interest income fell less than expected. 
Persistently low interest rates drove net interest income down 1% from a year before in the fourth quarter, taking the drop for the whole year to 11%.

Profit was also pushed up significantly by a 245 million euro net gain on the sale and leaseback of ABN's headquarters in the south of Amsterdam.

Tereos, the world's second largest sugar maker by volume, said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter ending Dec. 31 rose 65% at constant exchanges rates to 223 million euros ($254 million).
It confirmed a goal to reach EBITDA on a 12-month rolling basis of 600-700 million euros by the end of September 2022. For the 12 months ended Dec. 31, EBITDA came to 516 million euros.
The French cooperative expects sugar prices to remain high as it sees the world market remaining in deficit for a third year in a row while Europe faces supply tensions.
For its starch business, where increased volumes supported the third-quarter results, Tereos said it would pass on rising cereal and energy costs in sale prices.
Soaring gas prices had a limited impact on the group in recent months due to hedging but are expected to weigh more on its European sugar results from this quarter, Tereos added.
The company said this week that CEO Philippe de Raynal was leaving the group after only a year and would be replaced on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer Gwenael Elies.
De Raynal's team, which made deleveraging the heavily indebted cooperative a priority, undertook a wide-ranging review of its activities. This led to the sale of its starch operations in China, the exit of the malt sector and the launch of a process to close its loss-making sugar business in Romania.
Tereos said its net debt stood at 2.52 billion euros at the end of 2021, a level stable compared with March 31, and down from 2.7 billion euros a year earlier.
Tereos last month raised 350 million euros of senior unsecured notes due in 2027, which it said it would use to repay existing debt.

It reiterated medium-term financial targets for 2024, including net debt below 2 billion euros.

Akzo Nobel added that it expected its pricing to rise by 14-16% in the first quarter of 2022.
The Dulux paint maker reported October-December adjusted operating income of 209 million euros ($238.72 million) while analysts had forecast 212.5 million. 
Revenue rose 9% to 2.40 billion euros in the quarter, while analysts had forecast 2.38 billion.
Akzo Nobel also announced plans to buy back 500 million euros in shares by the first quarter of 2023 and a 1.54 euros per share dividend for 2021.
In a call with journalists, financial officer Maarten de Vries said that the firm was ""getting back to normal seasonality"" after pandemic lockdowns, which have forced people to spend time at home and fuelled a rise in do-it-yourself projects.

The group confirmed its guidance for 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 2 billion euros.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 02:11AM ET</span>",SoftBank's choice of New York for Arm listing deals a blow to London,"By Paul Sandle and John McCrank
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -SoftBank's decision to list British chip designer Arm is good news for New York, bad news for London and the best option left for the Japanese group after the collapse of its blockbuster sale to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Arm, whose technology underpins the global smartphone industry, is most likely to float on the Nasdaq, SoftBank's CEO said, where it will tap into U.S. investor appetite and analyst expertise. 
The move deals a blow to London where Arm traded, with a secondary listing on Nasdaq, from 1998 to 2016 before it was sold to SoftBank for $32 billion.
Jay Ritter, an IPO specialist at the University of Florida, said although tech valuations had fallen worldwide, there was still the belief that U.S. private market and public market investors understood tech companies and were willing to pay top dollar.
""The rationale for why a lot of tech companies list on Nasdaq is a perception that U.S. investors quote-unquote, understand technology, and are willing to pay a higher price for companies with compelling growth prospects,"" he said.
U.S. listed semiconductor stocks have been on a ""tremendous run"" in recent years, led by Nvidia, which just overtook Meta to become the seventh largest U.S. company by market value, said Richard Clode at Janus Henderson Investors.
The jump in Nvidia's share price increased the value of its cash and share offer for Arm from an original $40 billion to as much as $80 billion, a valuation far in excess of what it is likely to achieve on the public market.
However, the United States remained the best option, Clode said.
""Growth semiconductors in the U.S. now enjoy valuations well ahead of similar growth semiconductor franchises in Europe or Asia like ASML and TSMC,"" he said. 
Following disappointing London listings for food delivery platform Deliveroo and the more comparable peer, Alphawave, Clode said you could understand the appeal of a U.S. listing even if London investors were clamouring for a tech business of the quality of Arm. 
Nasdaq led U.S. IPOs for the third consecutive year in 2021, hosting 752 IPOs, including nine of the top 10 largest U.S.-based market debuts by capital raised, with $181 billion in capital raised in total, the exchange operator said.
Electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which raised over $12 billion in its November listing, making it the largest U.S. IPO since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014, and chip maker GlobalFoundries Inc, which raised $2.6 billion.
Arm, Britain's tech champion which licenses its processor blueprints to more than 500 companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), was sold with the minimum of scrutiny to SoftBank in 2016.
The deal came days after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, and the government seized on it to show the country remained open to international investors. 
Since then Britain has tightened its takeover rules, while London has also changed its listing rules to try to attract more tech companies, for example allowing a founder to retain additional voting rights. 
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that London had enjoyed record IPOs last year and it was confident the UK remained a great place for tech companies. 
Tech makes up just 1% of the FTSE 100 index, compared with more than 20% for financials and 17% for consumer goods.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said recent efforts by the UK government to make London more attractive seemed not to be cutting it. 
""If the UK's largest home grown tech firms shuns London for New York it will be a major blow to London's ambitions and will pile pressure on the government to speed up reforms,"" she said.

Hermann Hauser, a co-founder of Arm, said he would like to see the company listed in London because it was very much a national champion.
""Arm of course had a dual listing in London and in New York before it was bought by SoftBank. And that's really my hope: If we can't get a London listing, at least a dual listing between London and Nasdaq,"" he told Reuters.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Wednesday on a busy day for corporate earnings, but investors are still keeping a wary eye on the tense situation in Ukraine ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data later in the week.
By 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7%.
The corporate sector has been in focus Wednesday, on a busy day for quarterly earnings. 
GlaxoSmithKline (LON:GSK) stock rose 0.5% after beating quarterly forecasts, boosted by hefty Covid-related sales, largely for antibody drug sotrovimab. The British drugmaker said it expected pandemic-related sales in 2022 to be at similar levels to 2021 but said these would contribute less to profit due to lower margins on its antibody treatment.
Norwegian oil company Equinor (OL:EQNR) stock rose 4.5% after the Norwegian oil company posted record pretax profits for the fourth quarter, while Amundi (PA:AMUN) stock climbed 3.2% as the French funds manager posted a strong rise in earnings helped by its retail business and expansion in Asia.
On the flip side, Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock fell 1% after the shipping giant forecast full year earnings slightly below expectations, adding that supply chains are likely to experience disruption throughout 2022. 
ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) stock fell 3.6% despite the Dutch bank announcing a 500 million euro ($570 million) share buyback program, with its fourth-quarter results helped significantly by a hefty net gain on the sale and leaseback of its headquarters in the south of Amsterdam.
Elsewhere, U.K. retailer John Menzies rose 34% after it said it had rejected an unsolicited bid from a Kuwaiti investment vehicle, while fast fashion  Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) fell another 2.4% to a six-year low after an apparent faux pas in the marketing of its new beauty range.
Elsewhere, Thursday’s U.S. consumer prices release is firmly in the spotlight, with the headline CPI seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year in January, probably cementing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in March.
Additionally, the fraught situation on the Ukraine border continues to command attention amid worries an invasion by Russia could inflict economic damage on the entire region.
The European Central Bank is preparing banks for a possible Russian-sponsored cyber attack, Reuters reported Wednesday, while Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International last week announced it has set aside risk provisions for possible sanctions on Russia. RBI is one of the largest lenders in Russia, and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
German exports and imports rose unexpectedly in December, despite continued raw material bottlenecks. Seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.9% on the month, compared with an expected decline of 0.2%, while imports jumped 4.7%, compared with an average forecast for a 1.5% decrease.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stocks, implying healthy demand at the world’s largest consumer.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a drop of 2 million barrels in crude inventories last week, against analyst expectations of a 400,000-barrel increase.
Official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later in the session.
Concerns about a possible Iran nuclear deal that could lift U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil and quickly add supplies to the market have resulted in the market dropping over the last two sessions.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $89.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $91.08.   
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,827.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1421.

555,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 01:25AM ET</span>",France's Amundi beats strategic targets on surging inflows,"(Reuters) - French funds manager Amundi said it exceeded its 2022 strategic targets on Wednesday, as it posted a strong rise in earnings helped by its retail business and expansion in Asia.
Amundi, which largely manages assets in Europe but has a growing presence in China, posted a quarterly adjusted net income up 14% to 328 million euros, bringing its annual figure to up 37% to 1.32 billion euros ($1.51 billion).
""We have now reached and surpassed the targets we laid out in our 2018-2022 strategic plan,"" said Chief Executive Valérie Baudson in a call with journalists.
Baudson said the group would soon announce a new plan with fresh financial targets alongside a publication from its parent company, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY).
The firm said inflows had been especially high from third-party retail distributors in Europe during the fourth quarter, and that it had also benefited from good performances from its Asian joint ventures - notably in China and India.
Amundi's net inflows came in at 65.6 billion euros in the fourth quarter, while the consolidation of ETF specialist Lyxor lifted its assets under management past 2 trillion euros at the end of 2021.
The group expects to integrate Lyxor, which it bought from French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) last year, in the second and third quarters of this year.
It proposed a dividend up 41% from last year, at 4.1 euros per share.
Amundi also said it had surpassed its ESG targets for 2021, as it looks to ramp up its corporate responsibility with a new set of ambitions that would tie its performance to the pay of its senior executives.

A huge variation in scope, definitions and targets have made assessing corporate responsibility exceedingly difficult for investors, and asset managers face a growing pressure to ensure that their investments chime with Europe's ambitions to limit global warming.

556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 01:09AM ET</span>",Europe’s Most Valuable Fintech Unicorn Klarna Faces Risk of Rising Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- Klarna Bank AB is Europe’s most valuable fintech unicorn, a payment pioneer in a booming sector that’s being wooed by London for its potential stock listing. It also has a funding model that’s going to be threatened by the rapidly emerging reality of higher interest rates.
The Swedish “buy now, pay later” company gives out effectively interest-free loans so online shoppers can stagger payments, while it depends on merchant fees and late payment penalties for revenue. It was valued at almost $46 billion after a funding round led by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) last year.
It uses a mix of customer deposits -- it offers conventional bank accounts in Sweden and Germany -- and short-term debt to fund the loans. This is a model that thrives in a low interest-rate world because such debt tends to be very cheap, and rates on deposits are still extremely low.
But things are shifting fast. Bank of England interest rates are already rising, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to follow in March, and there are bets that the European Central Bank could also move this year. Given the model behind Klarna’s rapid growth, the change coming in 2022 has implications for funding costs.
“The whole business model is based on wafer thin margins -- it doesn’t have the buffer of high interests that credit card providers charge on usage,” said John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School and a fintech expert. “Once the environment turns nasty, which it is going to, it falls flat.”
Klarna is among a raft of “buy now, pay later” companies attracting young consumers and investor attention. It says it has 90 million active customers and processes 2 million transactions a day. Others including Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM),  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), In 3 and Afterpay, which was bought by Jack Dorsey’s  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) for $29 billion last year.
The firm’s debt includes 3.1 billion Swedish krona ($297 million) of bonds coming due in the next two years and a 5 billion-krona commercial paper program, a form of short-term debt that’s becoming less popular because of market stress at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. 
In response to questions from Bloomberg, Klarna said that only a small portion of its lending is funded through debt, and estimates that 80-85% comes from customer deposits. “The average maturity of Klarna’s credit portfolio is around 40 days. As such, the maturity profile of the funding overall is longer than that of the assets,” it said.
In a financial report last October, Klarna said that loans to consumers totaled about 52 billion krona. 
Deposits stood at 45 billion krona and debt securities at 8.1 billion krona, about 15% of the mix. While that ratio by itself isn’t a concern, the potential issue relates to the nature of the debt.
“Thanks to the ECB, short-term borrowing costs will remain very low for the next year or so. But eventually, rates will go up and companies using this will have to re-evaluate their model,” said Pierre Boyer, head of short-term debt at Belgian fund manager Candriam. “Will that mean a big change for financial institutions using this? Absolutely.” 
He hasn’t invested in Klarna’s commercial paper, but has positions in similar instruments by other European financial institutions. Klarna’s debt is mostly held by local Swedish investors; Bloomberg attempted to contact a selection of these without success. 
While traditional banks also borrow to lend, Klarna is different because it charges customers little to no interest if they pay on time. It reported a pretax loss of 3.1 billion krona in the first nine months of 2021. 
There’s also the fragility of commercial paper, where maturities typically range from a few days to a few months, which was exposed in the turmoil in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.
Access to commercial paper froze when the pandemic first roiled markets, forcing the Fed and the European Central Bank to step in to stabilize it. Several large corporations have since reduced reliance on it.
“Understandably, companies such as Klarna like to get as cheap funding as possible, but the risks are when that debt turns over and the markets do get volatile or seize up as it did during the pandemic,” said Michael Taiano, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. “We tend to like longer-dated maturities that are, in an ideal world, spread out over a longer time frame.”

The MSCI Asia-Pacific index's forward 12-month P/E ratio stood at 13.49 at the end of last month, which was its lowest since April 2020, Refinitiv data showed.

The MSCI Asia-Pacific index shed 4.4% in January, its worst start to a year in six years. China's Shanghai Composite Index declined 7.6% last month, which pulled down its forward P/E ratio to 10.18, the lowest in Asia.

Shares of tech companies in South Korea and Taiwan also faced big losses due to a spike in bond yields, and their forward 12-month P/E stood at 10.34 and 13.33 respectively. 
On the other hand, Indian shares were the most expensive in the region, with a forward P/E of 20.42. 
However, some analysts said Asian equities look attractive at these levels.
Suresh Tantia, senior investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said valuation of Asian stocks have become less expensive and they have been trading at a discount to global equities.
""With an outlook of over 9% EPS growth this year supported by another year of above trend GDP growth, we still expect positive returns over the medium term,"" he said.
Anthony Raza, head of multi-asset strategy at UOB Asset Management, said the exports in Asia have been very strong, with the economic flows making Asian equities more attractive.
""We have been underweight or neutral on Asia for the past three quarters, but are now back to overweight Asia. We think they are set to catch up given their previous underperformance.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed two charges against a former chief technical pilot for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co accused of deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet, but rejected a request to dismiss the other four counts.
U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas granted part of the request of lawyers for former Boeing technical pilot Mark Forkner, dismissing two fraud counts alleging Forkner made materially false communications concerning a key airplane software feature called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
MCAS is a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane's nose down in certain conditions. It was tied to the two 737 MAX crashes over a five-month period in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounding the plane for 20 months, an action lifted in November 2020.
O'Connor ruled Tuesday the two charges could not proceed because they must involve a tangible airplane part -- rather than the MCAS software feature.
""MCAS is intangible computer code in the aircraft’s flight control software,"" O'Connor wrote. ""MCAS is not an 'aircraft part.'""
O'Connor rejected a request to dismiss the other four counts which allege wire fraud. Forkner was indicted in October on charges of scheming to defraud Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars for Boeing.
The case is currently set for trial in early March.

In January 2021, Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over the MAX crashes, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion.
The Justice Department said on Tuesday in a separate filing that it has not charged Forkner ""with causing the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 or Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and that it does not intend to argue that he caused them.""

(Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia posted a forecast-beating surge in first-half profit and said it would buy back $1.4 billion of stock as a home loan boom offset thinner margins. Its shares soared 6%.
The country's biggest lender outpaced rivals in attracting home buyers, benefiting from its sheer volume of business at a time when ultra-low interest rates and a switch by many borrowers to fixed-rate mortgages are squeezing loan margins.
CBA's loan margin narrowed more than rivals, dropping 14 basis points from the same period a year earlier. But cash profit - the measure banks focus on because it only includes ongoing business - jumped 23% to A$4.75 billion ($3.4 billion).
That compares with an average estimate of A$4.35 billion from four brokerages. A decline in provisions for impaired loans contributed to the profit increase.
""The margin compression was worse than what I was expecting, but...the settings are in place for the bank to do really well when the rates do go higher,"" said Nathan Zaia, an analyst at Morningstar.
""They've demonstrated they can take share and keep processing more and more loans.""
The Australian property market has been on a tear https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/australia-home-prices-boast-bumper-2021-rates-stay-low-2022-01-03 since the introduction of emergency-level interest rates at the start of the pandemic. Nationwide house prices rocketed 22% higher in 2021, with many buyers keen to upsize amid a shift to working from home.
CBA said the margin pressure was likely to continue as more borrowers changed to fixed-rate loans although expected interest rate rises from August 2022 are likely to provide a strong tailwind for profit margins.
The bank sees ""strong underlying momentum"" in Australia ""at least until the end of 2023,"" CEO Matt Comyn told an analysts call, citing hefty savings, wage growth and rising demand for goods.
Also bolstered by the A$2 billion share buyback and an interim dividend hike worth A$3 billion, CBA's shares logged their biggest intraday jump in nearly two years, valuing the lender at A$170 billion.

They may need to in this climate, judging by the experience of Douglas MacKenzie, a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker who has spent decades advising global energy giants on fossil fuel deals since joining Goldman Sachs as an associate in 1985.
""I cover Big Oil. I'm a supermajor guy,"" the 63-year-old said. ""Now all of my clients are focused on the transition."" 
He decided he had to get up to speed with greener energy sources in 2018 and is now EMEA chairman of Citi's new Natural Resources and Clean Energy Transition team, which was launched last March, part of a wider pivot by investment banking towards helping energy clients move away from fossil fuels. 
Oil and gas dealmakers, once the darlings of banking, must plot their own transitions to lower-carbon careers. 
Many are being retrained and repurposed as major banks including Citi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) merge them into bigger teams that include clean power and sustainability specialists. 
""I spend 12 hours a day reading,"" said MacKenzie, whose past deals include BP (NYSE:BP) Plc's $48.2 billion merger with Amoco in 1999.
""As an oil and gas banker I would stay current with geopolitics, get up in the morning and click the BBC website to make sure hostilities hadn't broken out somewhere. But now I'm trying to follow the technology.""
There is still a lot of money to be made in oil and gas, with bankers striking about $290 billion in deals globally in 2021, roughly 10 times the level transacted for renewables, according to Refinitiv data.
A changing of the guard is underway though, with the volume of renewables M&A in 2021 growing more than 11-fold versus five years ago, while the annual number of oil and gas deals is down by a quarter over the same period.
""If you're a renewables banker you are going to be busy for the next 30-plus years,"" said Ralph Ibendahl, head of a new Energy Transition group at RBC Capital Markets in Europe.
""When you are in traditional oil and gas that field is inevitably going to narrow over time with the move to net zero.""
Yet some bankers face dilemmas over when to take the plunge, and risk being left behind in an evolving low-carbon finance arena.
Jason Moore, founder of London-based recruiting firm Harrington Moore, said some seasoned bankers were moving to niche oil and gas boutiques. Many people are racing to learn about new green technologies, though, before the competition becomes too intense, he added. 
""The pivot is not too difficult right now,"" he said. ""They probably have another 12 to 18-month window. The skill set is there already, they know how to structure deals.""
BANKS' BUMPER DEALS
Most investment banks have kept their fingers firmly in both pies. 
Citi topped the global rankings for the value of renewables M&A deals it arranged in 2021, at around $6.3 billion, yet it still advised on oil and gas deals worth $49.3 billion, according to Refinitiv calculations which classify renewables as including businesses active in areas such as renewable fuels, equipment for wind and solar systems, and related services.
Elsewhere on Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) arranged renewables deals worth about $5.2 billion versus $87.7 billion in oil and gas,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) recorded figures of $1.4 billion and $94.6 billion, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) $2 billion and $50.7 billion.
Rob Santangelo, global co-head of energy and transition investment banking at Credit Suisse, said conversations with oil and gas companies reflected both a focus on future developments and current market realities.
""While their development dollars are still majority weighted towards traditional energy, big oil and gas companies are spending most of the time thinking about the transition.""
As banks seek to straddle the gulf between old and new, they are looking to training to ensure their dealmakers can talk a good green game.
Over the past two years, for example, Societe Generale has used online tools including one that promises to condense the essential issues of climate change into three hours, for those who don't have time to read 2,000-page reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
POWER WITH AN OIL ACCENT
European energy companies are leading the way on transition plans. Shell (LON:RDSa), for example, has struck a string of renewables deals, buying companies such as Savion and Inspire Energy Capital at undisclosed prices while also clinching a $9.5 billion deal to sell its assets in the Permian Basin - the heart of the U.S. shale oil industry - to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). 
Yet there has also been movement in the United States, where President Joe Biden's support for combating climate change chimes with investors who are raising questions about how America's oil and gas giants will adapt for the future.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), which was successfully challenged by activist investor Engine No. 1 in 2021 over its climate goals, and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) have both been making small acquisitions and striking partnerships in areas including sustainable jet fuels and hydrogen. Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) is trying to position itself as America's leader in carbon capture and sequestration.
But some long-time oil and gas bankers are cautious about embracing their own institutions' new focus on cleaner energy. One senior U.S. banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described efforts to create new advisory teams as ""window dressing"", noting the meagre prices paid for renewables firms versus the hefty sums in traditional energy tie-ups.
Taking stock of the nascent world of the start-ups developing cleaner technologies may also require a shift for investment bankers on both sides of the Atlantic accustomed to planning fossil fuel mega-deals.
""Some banks are still in a big-project power generation mindset. I think they need to think a bit more flexibly as projects become smaller and solutions more bespoke,"" said Jonathan Maxwell, founder and CEO of London-based fund Sustainable Development Capital.

For MacKenzie at Citi, the career shift has been rewarding.
""I woke up one day and realised that as a banker I had evolved,"" he said. ""I tell my clients I speak power, with an oil and gas accent, but I speak power.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning. Investors are keeping an eye on the tightening monetary policies.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.92% by 10:08 PM ET (3:09 AM GMT). The Bank of Japan sticks to its bond buying plan even yields rose to 0.215%, closer to the central bank’s ceiling.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.67%
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.57%
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 1.86%
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.35% while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.75%. Chinese state-backed funds intervened in the stock market to buy local stocks Tuesday afternoon after the biggest intraday drop of the benchmark index since August 2021. U.S. equity futures advanced. Bond markets remain wary as the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to raise interest rates to restrain inflation.
Investors are keeping an eye on continuous robust corporate earnings against worries about a rapid withdrawal of stimulus measures since the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive liftoff in March as data this week may show a mounting U.S. inflation.
“We’re still in an environment where a lot is going quite well for the economy,” Lauren Goodwin, a multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “It’s still an all-cyclicals story from our perspective.”
Goodwin said the firm is looking at asset classes like small-caps and value stocks while stressing the importance of security selection.
About 76% of S&P 500 firms have reported profits were more than 6% above projected levels.
“Even though the growth rate is slowing, we are still seeing positive revisions going forward,” Erin Gibbs, Main Street Asset Management chief investment officer, told Bloomberg Television.
That and forward guidance suggest companies “clearly think that profit growth is going to significantly outpace inflation for a year so that is another positive sign,” Gibbs said."
563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 09:09PM ET</span>",China State Funds’ Support Gives Hope for Wounded Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese state-backed funds’ intervention in domestic stock markets Tuesday is rekindling hope that a bottom is near for the nation’s battered equities.
The CSI 300 Index ended down just 0.6% at the close on Tuesday, paring an earlier slump of 2.4%, which was its biggest intraday drop since August. State-related funds entered the market to buy local shares in the afternoon session, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter is private. 
Meanwhile, U.S.-listed Chinese stocks gained overnight, with technology names including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. leading the way. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 3.9% on Tuesday. The CSI 300 rose as much as 0.3% in early trading on Wednesday.
The move by state funds was intended to slow the pace of declines, one of the people said. Financial shares including brokerages were among those to have been purchased, the person said. Sub-gauges of cyclical sectors such as energy, utilities and financials posted gains in Tuesday’s session even as the benchmark ended lower.
The people didn’t provide information on the amount purchased or the frequency of such buying. The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn’t reply to a fax seeking comment.
Support from state funds, known as China’s “national team,” came as the mainland’s benchmark gauge looked set to erase its advance from Monday, when local markets reopened following the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. The index plunged into a bear market before the break as worries about a weak economy and the property sector’s debt woes outweighed Beijing’s monetary easing, and efforts from the securities regulator, state media and mutual funds failed to lift sentiment.
National team’s “buying shows that stock prices are already at attractive levels, but the market may need some time to bottom out as investor sentiment recovers slowly,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. 
Since the bursting of the stock bubble in 2015, Bloomberg has reported at least seven occasions of state funds interventions. On average, stocks continued to decline over the next three months, but at a slower pace, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The CSI 300 fell by an average of 2.3% in the month after the reported intervention, compared with a loss of 5.1% in the previous month. The stock market did fare better over the ensuing six-month period, returning 5.5% on average.
Historically, Beijing has supported markets when needed around significant events or dates. The funds stepped in to stem a market rout during the National People’s Congress in March last year. 
Unreasonable fear is detrimental to an economy, so “state-backed intervention to buy stocks makes sense, it is a well-targeted form of easing,” said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds SA in Luxembourg. “The next phase is to convince households and the market that the economy will rebound and China’s record is pretty solid.”
Stocks on the mainland have had a weak start to 2022 as the monetary policy divergence between Beijing and Washington -- touted as one key reason for global brokerages to recently turn bullish on Chinese shares -- has yet to lead to any meaningful gains. Even last month’s cut to a key interest rate failed to excite local traders, with the CSI 300 down 6.7% so far this year.
The gauge’s slump earlier Tuesday was driven by concerns over consumer spending as economic trends during the festive break -- typically a boon for spending and travel -- disappointed investors. While Chinese people traveled more compared with last year, the pandemic and restrictions to control outbreaks hurt domestic tourism spending, which fell from 2021’s already low level.
Consumer spending needs to pick up for China to start to “perform pretty well against the rest of the world,” Sean Taylor, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at DWS, said on Bloomberg Television. For now, people will want to move past the Olympics and seek more guidance from the government about stimulus, he added.
Bear Market
Local traders have followed global peers in dumping expensive stocks as bond yields rise. The tech-heavy ChiNext Index ended 2.5% lower, taking its losses from an August peak to 20% and pushing it into bear-market territory.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. plunged 6.7% in Tuesday’s session, while Kweichow Moutai Co. lost as much as 4.2% before finishing 1.6% lower.
Sino-American tensions could also add to bearish sentiment as the U.S. is said to be losing patience with China after the nation failed to meet its purchase commitments under their trade agreement. Separately, the U.S. Department of Commerce added 33 entities in China, including Wuxi Biologics Cayman Inc., to its unverified list. That drove a group of healthcare stocks to its lowest level in nearly two years.

Even if it’s true, “national team buying is a sign of weakness, not strength,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong. The mainland equities “have clearly peaked” and volatility will continue, he added.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to increase production of electric trucks and Cadillac sport utility vehicles this year by more than six times the previously planned output, according to information shared with suppliers.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors last week the automaker intended to accelerate production of electric vehicles, aiming to deliver 400,000 EVs in North America during 2022 and 2023. She did not give specifics for how quickly production rates would grow.
New details shared with suppliers indicate GM intends to increase production of its electric trucks and a new battery-powered Cadillac SUV to a total of 46,000 vehicles this year, up from a previous plan to build just 7,000 of those vehicles this year, according to information shared with suppliers. 
GM is also expected to re-start production of its Chevrolet Bolt EVs. The Bolt line has been idled https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-extend-production-halt-ev-chevrolet-bolt-through-february-2021-12-20as GM replaces batteries in existing Bolts under a recall.
""As we have said, we have announced battery cell and assembly capacity investments that will give us more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025,"" GM said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We now have teams working to accelerate all of our upcoming EV launches, and our target is to deliver 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022 and 2023.""
GM told suppliers to its electric GMC Hummer EV trucks to plan for production of 21,000 of those vehicles this year at the automaker's Factory Zero in Detroit, up from the previous plan to build 3,800 vehicles.
GM has reservations for nearly 59,000 GMC Hummer EV pickups and SUVs, Barra said last week. The company has reservations for more than 110,000 of the electric Chevrolet Silverado pickups due to start production next year, Barra said. 
GM told suppliers for its Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV to gear up for production of 25,000 of those vehicles this year, up from the previous 3,200 planned, sources said. Barra said last week demand was strong for the Lyriq.
GM is responding not just to consumer demand, but to competitive pressure from long-time rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Ford has said it plans to expand its EV production capacity https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-aims-be-worlds-2-electric-vehicle-maker-within-two-years-coo-2021-12-03 to 600,000 vehicles a year by 2023. Ford began shipping electric Transit vans this week, and is aiming to begin delivering electric F-150 Lightning pickups this spring.

Meanwhile, electric vehicle market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is preparing to start production at its second U.S. assembly complex in Texas. Electric vehicle startups Rivian Automotive Inc and Lucid Group Inc are also ramping up production of their respective trucks and luxury sedans.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it had filed a joint lawsuit with digital banking company Chime against two Nigeria-based individuals who engaged in phishing attacks to deceive people and gain access to their online financial accounts.
The lawsuit, which is the first joint complaint between Meta and a financial services company, alleged that the defendants used Facebook and Instagram accounts to impersonate Chime and lure people to fake branded phishing websites with the aim of obtaining their Chime account login information and withdrawing funds. 
In the suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Meta said the defendants used a network of computers to control more than 800 impersonating Instagram accounts and five Facebook accounts, in order to conceal their activity and evade technical enforcement measures.
Reuters could not immediately reach the defendants for comment. 
""Impersonation scams are a serious challenge, and this action represents a major step forward in cross-industry collaboration against this abuse,"" Meta's director of platform enforcement and litigation Jessica Romero said in a blog post.

Fintech company Chime was launched by former  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) executive Chris Britt and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) alumnus Ryan King in 2012. Reuters exclusively reported last month that Chime had asked Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to help it with IPO preparations. 
Meta said it had taken several previous actions against the defendants since June 2020 for violating its terms, including disabling their accounts, blocking impersonating domains on its platforms and sending cease and desist letters.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 08:20PM ET</span>",Big European nations likely to gain the most from EU chip push,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee
STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission's plan to make the continent more lucrative for investing in semiconductor factories will likely skew the benefits towards larger countries such as Germany, France and Italy, analysts say. 
With billions of euros of public and private investment, along with covering up to 100% of the proven funding gap with public resources, a subsidy race could tilt the balance toward countries with larger resources.
""I don't see how that can be avoided as that's just the nature of the beast ... same as in the U.S. where states give different subsidies to get the companies to build in a given state,""  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) chip analyst Alan Priestley said. 
Chip manufacturing in Europe has dropped from 24% of global production capacity in 2000 to a current 8%, and chipmaker ASML warned that it could fall to 4% if no action is taken.
U.S. firms now have a 47% market share of the chip industry, followed by Asia, with Europe a distant third, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association.
The current European chip legislation helps to address that by providing deeper subsidies and state support to grab a 20% share of the global capacity by 2030. 
Industry sources pointed to more global collaboration with other regions as the chip supply chain spans the world, otherwise it would cost at least 1 trillion euro for a fully autonomous chip supply chain. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has been planning to invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade, said it expects the Chips Act to help its plans to expand its European footprint.
The U.S. chipmaker has been scouting for locations in Germany, France and Italy.
And that exactly is the fear of the smaller countries. They suspect international firms looking at the continent may not consider the smaller ones for setting up factories that cost in excess of $20 billion economy to build.
Analysts said that while subsidies are a major factor, availability of talent, land and research institutes would also be considered before setting up a factory.
Germany, France and Italy had earlier provided state aide for building competency around microelectronics through Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) with a funding budget of 2 billion euros.
The new legislation will also support smaller, innovative companies in accessing advanced skills, industrial partners and equity finance, and several analysts said those firms may choose smaller countries to set up their operations.
""The presence of a next-generation semiconductor fabrication plant in Europe would have positive spill-over effects, driving investment in European supply chains and act as a magnet for scarce talent,"" ING analyst Jan Frederik Slijkerman said. 
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said investments would also come from a second pan-European IPCEI in chips involving more than 100 participants from about 20 EU countries and focusing on AI processors and edge computing.

Asked about TSMC's interest in building a factory in Europe and possible EU aid, she said: ""Europe is also open for business, also for TSMC.""
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker which said last month it was still in the very early stages of assessing a potential fab in Europe, declined to comment on the European chip legislation.

(Reuters) -Lyft Inc's first full-year adjusted profit and a spike in pricey airport trips were overshadowed by a drop in ridership due to Omicron, which management on Tuesday warned would persist into the first quarter and drag down profit. 
The projected hit to first-quarter revenue and profit sparked a 6% drop in  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares in after-hours trading. Shares of larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which reports results on Wednesday, dropped 1.3%.
Lyft said it expected first-quarter revenue of between $800 million and $850 million, a decline of up to $170 million compared with the last quarter of 2021. Analysts on average forecast first-quarter revenue of $984 million.
Lyft also said it expected to report significantly lower adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, in the first quarter. 
Executives, including newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Elaine Paul, prepared investors for between $5 million and $15 million in first-quarter adjusted EBITDA, compared with the nearly $75 million in the fourth quarter. 
""Were it not for Omicron we would be projecting strong sequential quarter-over-quarter ride growth and revenue growth,"" Paul said. She added that Lyft remained committed to being profitable in adjusted EBITDA. 
Asked whether Lyft expected the Omicron situation to improve in coming weeks, Paul said the company was seeing positive signals as mask mandates were lifted in some markets.
""Omicron is still the wild card,"" Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said, adding that recovery remains in question until events and conferences return and offices reopen.
The Omicron warnings cast a shadow over Lyft's first full-year adjusted EBITDA profit, as fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% to $969.9 million from a year ago, beating analysts' estimates of $940.1 million, according to Refinitiv data.
On a net basis, Lyft still lost $1 billion in 2021, although that was narrower than the $1.8 billion loss of 2020. 
Per-rider revenue reached nearly $52 in the fourth quarter - a 13.5% increase from the third quarter and the highest amount in the company's nearly 10-year history. 
Lyft executives attributed the revenue hike to a doubling of costlier airport trips compared with the prior year.
Lyft never generated as much revenue per rider even in pre-pandemic times, and as customers return, Lyft and its larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  have discovered their surprising power to raise prices without alienating riders. 
While riders continued returning to the platform compared with 2020 levels, ridership in the fourth quarter decreased by roughly 1% versus the prior quarter and ridership remains 30% below pre-COVID levels.
Lyft recorded some 18.7 million active riders in the fourth quarter, short of analyst estimates for 20.2 million riders, according to Factset. 
Lyft attributed the drop in ridership to seasonality and fewer bike and scooter riders during the cold weather, but declined to break down the share of ride-hail versus micromobility users. Lyft President John Zimmer also said 2021's New Year's Eve had been less busy than in previous years.
Drivers, many of whom gave up during the pandemic due to a lack of customers and safety concerns, also continued returning to the platform. 
Total active drivers in the fourth quarter were up 34% year-over-year, but Lyft declined to say how driver supply compared with pre-pandemic levels.

The ongoing work-from-home trend, particularly on the U.S. West Coast, and travel patterns shifting away from peak rush hours during the pandemic also proved beneficial, Zimmer said. 
""The commute was never an ideal trip for us ... and so the fact that the commute has changed will be an opportunity for us long-term.""

568,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 07:01PM ET</span>",Boeing deliveries remain low as 787 problems weigh,"(Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Tuesday it delivered 32 aircraft in January as its sidelined 787 Dreamliner program continued to weigh on the planemaker's ability to capitalize on a recovery in air travel.
The company handed over 27 737 MAX jets in January and three widebody aircraft, including a 777 freighter, Boeing (NYSE:BA) said in its closely watched monthly report.
Of the 27 MAX deliveries, seven were to Irish budget carrier Ryanair, while China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) took delivery of one 777 freighter.
Boeing handed over https://www.boeing.com/commercial 38 jets in December and 34 in November. 
The fewer January deliveries reflect a seasonal dip. Boeing delivered 26 aircraft in the same period a year ago.
The 737 MAX and the 787 Dreamliner are crucial to Boeing's ability to recover from the pandemic and catch up with Airbus, having lost out on the delivery race to its European rival for the third consecutive year.
After slashing production mainly due to the pandemic, planemakers are seeing more demand for medium-haul passenger jets and freighters, and are rushing to ramp up production.
However, snags in Dreamliner production have proved costly for Boeing, with the company incurring $4.5 billion in charges in the fourth quarter and paying customers penalties for pushing back deliveries.
Boeing booked 77 orders on a gross basis in January, including for 55 MAX airplanes and 22 freighters. Demand for the cargo planes has been a bright spot for the company, as it continues to dominate sales during an e-commerce surge.
Of the freighter orders, 14 were from Qatar Airways for the 777-8 model. The airline last month handed Boeing an order for 34 new 777X freighters and 25 737-10 MAX jets.
Of the 737 MAX orders in January, 20 were from unspecified customers, with U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co making up the remaining 35.
There were two cancellations for the 737 MAX in January, bringing Boeing's overall net orders to 75.
Airbus delivered 30 airplanes in January.
A $600 million contractual and safety dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways deepened on Tuesday when the European planemaker revoked orders for two A350-1000 jets, days after ripping up an order from the Gulf carrier for 50 A321neos. 

Qatar Airways has sued Airbus for more than $600 million and is refusing to take further delivery of A350s until its regulator receives a formal analysis of erosion to the painted surface and underlying lightning protection on 21 of the jets.
Airbus included the cancellations for 50 A321neos and two A350-1000s in a monthly summary for January, pushing it into negative territory with a net total of minus 16 orders for the month, after receiving 36 new orders.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Tuesday, lifted by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while a jump in Treasury yields elevated bank stocks ahead of a key inflation reading this week.
The benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed early losses and gained in the latter part of the session, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) gaining 2.2%, and Apple and Microsoft both rising over 1%.
The S&P 500 banking index rallied 1.9% after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest level since November 2019 on mounting expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will start tightening monetary policy.
Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all gained over 1%. 
The S&P 500 energy sector index sank 2.1% as investors worried the resumption of indirect talks between the United States and Iran could revive an international nuclear agreement and allow more oil exports from the OPEC producer.
Upbeat comments from French President Emmanuel Macron about his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine crisis also dented oil prices and reduced anxiety on Wall Street, said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Charlotte-based wealth management firm Horizon Investments.
""Today's gain is probably due to some of the Macron headlines, but it's also just recognition of the fact that the economy is in pretty good shape, and we probably overdid it a little to the downside,"" Ladner said.
With Tuesday's rise, the S&P 500 remains down about 5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq has lost about 9%.
U.S. consumer prices data, set to be released on Thursday, is forecast at a four-decade high of 7.3%. The numbers follow strong U.S. labor data last week that added to investor concerns that the Fed will tighten rates faster than thought. 
Concerns around aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. central bank, geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and mixed results from Big Tech have weighed on the major U.S. indexes since the start of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.06% to end at 35,462.78 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.84% to 4,521.52. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.28% to 14,194.46.
Earnings were mixed on Tuesday, with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) down after the drugmaker's full-year sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral pills fell short of estimates. 
 Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) surged nearly 8% after the company announced a buyback of up to $6 billion and forecast earnings would more than double by 2030.
Facebook-owner Meta Platforms fell 2.1% after billionaire investor Peter Thiel decided to step down from the company's board, driving a fourth day of losses in the stock after its bleak forecast last week wiped out billions of dollars in market value.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc soared 25%, despite slashing its revenue forecast as the exercise bike maker said it would replace its chief executive and cut jobs in a bid to revive sagging sales.
Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc jumped 8% after the cosmetics seller raised its earnings forecast for 2022.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 108 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.3 billion shares, compared with a 12.3 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian, in a letter https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1489673518581092355 first reported on Friday by Reuters, asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to place passengers convicted of on-board disruptions on a national ""no-fly"" list that would bar them from future travel on any commercial airline.
Bastian said the action would ""help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft.""
Justice Department spokesman Joshua Stueve said on Tuesday the department ""is continuing to prioritize the investigations and prosecutions of those who engage in criminal behavior that threatens the safety of passengers, flight crews, and flight attendants.""
The Justice Department ""will be referring Delta's letter to appropriate departments,"" Stueve added.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/02/07/delta-airlines-unruly-flight-passengers-no-fly-list-buttigieg-ath-vpx.cnn Monday that ""we need to take a look at"" placing unruly passengers on a federal no-fly list.
Bastian said Delta has placed nearly 1,900 people on Delta's ""no-fly"" list for refusing to comply with masking requirements and submitted more than 900 banned names to the Transportation Security Administration to pursue civil penalties.
The request comes amid a record spike in disruptive passengers reported over the last 13 months.
Delta noted there is currently a no-fly list that is a subset of the terrorism watch list that allows the U.S. government to prohibit persons considered a threat to civil aviation from traveling on airlines.

The Federal Aviation Administration has taken a ""zero tolerance"" approach and referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Delta in September called on other airlines to share their unruly passenger ""no-fly"" list to ensure individuals ""who have endangered the safety and security of our people do not go on to do so on another carrier.""

""The supply chain department has been intentionally strengthened with new and existing leadership,"" the company said in a statement.
""Nikola is focusing its efforts on getting its first BEVs and FCEVs to market and continues to hire strategically for critical roles.""
Electrek had reported that the company had lost almost its entire supply-chain leadership over the last few months and had put a hiring freeze in place. 
Matthew Jenkins, director of supply chain and purchasing; Mike Chaffins, global head of supply chain; and Mike Gallagher, director of purchasing had all left the company, according to the report. 
Reuters verified the news of their departures by checking the executives' LinkedIn profiles.
Nikola, which delivered its first batch of trucks in December, is facing allegations of overstating the capabilities of its electric- and hydrogen-powered trucks. 
Founder and former Chief Executive Officer Trevor Milton, who left the company in 2020, was criminally charged last year for lying to investors about Nikola's products and technology.

The company is facing a $125 million fine from the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle the charges.
Nikola shares lost 35.3% in 2021. They closed up 2.8% on Tuesday.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 06:36PM ET</span>","Pfizer's COVID product sales to top $50 billion this year, investors want more","By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Tuesday it expects 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral pill to top $54 billion, but that fell short of lofty Wall Street estimates and its shares were off about 3%.
Still, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said final sales for its oral COVID-19 antiviral, Paxlovid, could be ""way bigger"" than what Pfizer has forecast since its current outlook only included contracts that have been or are close to being signed. 
Pfizer currently expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment, compared with Wall Street estimates of $22.88 billion. 
""Clearly, this is only a fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture"" this year, Bourla told analysts on a conference call.
The company is selling 20 million courses of Paxlovid to the United States at around $530 a course, but Bourla said that was a special price because of the size of the order. 
The price for most high income countries, he said, would be more or less in line with the price of Merck & Co's rival treatment molnupiravir, which the U.S. government bought for around $700 a course.
Pfizer executives said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to top 120 million courses if needed. 
For the COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), the U.S. drugmaker cautioned that final sales for the year may not top its current forecast of $32 billion, a 13% decline from 2021 levels.
Last year, the company increased its COVID vaccine sales forecast several times as it signed more supply deals around the world.
Analysts have forecast sales of $33.79 billion for the vaccine in 2022, according to Refinitiv data.
Overall, Pfizer expects 2022 sales of $98 billion to $102 billion, also below estimates of $105.48 billion.
""Looking forward is not as good as looking back for Pfizer now and that is why (the stock price) is down on a somewhat decent report,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.
Going forward, ""acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards,"" said Aamir Malik, Pfizer's chief business innovation Officer. 
Some investors have been looking for Pfizer to use its huge cash infusion from COVID products on deals to drive future growth.
Pfizer said it had begun working on a next-generation version of Paxlovid, which is authorized to treat high-risk COVID-19 patients shortly after onset of symptoms. 
Paxlovid performed significantly better in its clinical trials than Merck's rival pill with about 90% efficacy versus 30%. 

But Pfizer may still need an improved version of Paxlovid, according to Davinderpreet Mangat, senior analyst at Informa Pharma Intelligence.
""The door is slightly open, still, for COVID antivirals,"" Mangat said. ""Drugs from other companies may be able to surpass Paxlovid, similar to how Paxlovid surpassed Merck's drug.""

Bradesco's recurring net income, which excludes one-off items, totaled 6.613 billion reais ($1.26 billion), below a Refinitiv analyst consensus of 6.916 billion reais and down 2.8% from a year earlier, as operating costs jumped.
Return on equity was at 17.5%, or 2.5 percentage points down from the previous quarter. 
Despite Brazil's more challenging economic environment in 2022, Bradesco said its loan book is likely to keep growing by double digits.
Amid expectations of flat economic growth this year, or even a recession, Bradesco's credit portfolio should expand between 10% and 14% in 2022, below last year's growth, it said. Net interest income with clients is seen growing between 8% and 12%.
As Brazil's surging inflation has eaten in to consumers' income, Bradesco said its loan-loss provisions are likely to total between 15 billion reais and 19 billion reais, up to 26.6% more than last year.
Despite fiercer competition with fintechs, the bank sees fee income rising between 2% and 6%.
Bradesco's insurance unit is also likely to boost its 2022 profit, as the bank said insurance results will expand between 18% and 23%.
Inflation is likely to drive costs up between 3% and 7%, while in 2021 they stood at 1.1%.
Amid double-digit inflation in Brazil last year, which pushed up salaries, the bank's operating costs rose 12.1% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.
Q4 PERFORMANCE
Cash set aside for bad loans fell 6.2% to 4.283 billion reais. However, the bank's 90-day default ratio rose 0.2 percentage points in the quarter to 2.8%.
Bradesco's loan book grew by 5.1% in the quarter, mainly driven by consumer lending. In all of 2021, it rose by 18.3%

Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 1.8% from a year earlier, to 16.96 billion reais.

(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profits and comparable sales on Tuesday as higher demand and prices for its burritos and rice bowls helped the restaurant chain shrug off a knock from the Omicron variant.
Shares in the company rose more than 8% after the bell.
Surging COVID-19 cases forced many restaurants to trim store hours amid a labor shortage, and rising costs caused other chains including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) to miss profit estimates. 
""We continue to see pressure on wages. We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol said during an earnings call. ""Our restaurants are staffed better than they were pre-COVID.""
Chipotle's move to introduce order-ahead drive-through lanes at more locations, as well as new menu items including smoked brisket, also helped cushion the blow. 
The chain reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.58 versus estimates of $5.25.
Higher-than-anticipated beef and freight costs prompted it to hike menu prices 4% in December, but the company has seen ""no resistance"" to higher prices, Niccol said. 
Digital sales grew 3.8% and made up 41.6% of sales in the quarter.
The company also raised its goal for opening new locations over time in North America to at least 7,000 versus 6,000 previously - particularly in smaller towns.

The burrito chain's comparable sales rose 15.2% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, while analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 14.8% growth.
The company forecast comparable restaurant sales growth in the range of mid-to-high single digits in the current quarter, compared with estimates of 7.6% growth.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc will replace its chief executive and cut about 2,800 jobs, the company said on Tuesday, as the exercise bike maker looks to revitalize sagging sales and win back investor confidence.
John Foley, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)'s co-founder who has led the company for nearly a decade, will step down to become the executive chair. Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), will take the helm from Wednesday. He will be paid a base salary of $1 million and a stock option award to buy 8 million shares of the company's Class A common stock, according to a regulatory filing. 
Foley has drawn the ire of activist investor Blackwells Capital in recent weeks as the company struggled to maintain the breakneck growth that propelled its valuation to $52 billion in early 2021. Shares have since tumbled nearly 80%. 
The investment firm called for his removal and even urged the company to sell itself, blaming the stock's underperformance to ""gross mismanagement"", Foley's poor decision making and a lack of credibility.
In response to Tuesday's announcement, Blackwells said the moves, which included the appointment of two directors to the board, did not address investors' concerns.[L1N2UJ17Z]
""Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or Executive Chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done (on Tuesday),"" Jason Aintabi, Blackwells' chief investment officer, said.
While Peloton has attracted interest from potential buyers including e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), according to media reports, analysts have said the company might be a difficult takeover target as it has two classes of stock, effectively allowing insiders to control it.
Shares surged 28% in midday trading on Tuesday as the company reassured investors on a call that the benefits of the restructuring and pricing changes will be visible in the second half of fiscal 2022.
""Wall Street likes the new Peloton CEO... so the stock is up again today anticipating that the new CEO will streamline the company and cut any waste,"" said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer for Navellier & Associates.
""As Peloton cleans up its balance sheet and cuts costs, it is definitely making itself a more attractive acquisition candidate.""
As part of its costcutting effort, Peloton plans to lay off roughly 20% of its corporate workforce. The company plans to offer ""meaningful cash severance"", health care, career services and 12 months of free Peloton membership, Foley wrote in a letter to staff. All-access membership current costs $39 a month. The company's instructors will get to stay. 
DOWNHILL 
Peloton's sales boomed during COVID-19 lockdowns, with many people snapping up home fitness equipment. But fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.
The company responded by slashing prices to make its bikes more affordable but that did little to stem the slide. 
Peloton will also cut jobs, affecting 20% of its corporate positions, after announcing last month it was reviewing the size of its workforce. 
The reductions will not affect its storied roster of fitness instructors and interactive online content. 

The company on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and slashed its forecast for full-year revenue, saying the lowered outlook was to adjust to changes in demand brought on by the reopening of economies.
Peloton will wind down the development of its planned factory in Ohio, where it was set to invest about $400 million and add more than 2,000 jobs over the next few years.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 05:11PM ET</span>","Purdue Pharma bankruptcy mediator says Sacklers, US states closer to deal over opioid claims","By Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) -A mediator reported on Tuesday that members of the Sackler family that own Purdue Pharma and U.S. states opposed to the OxyContin-maker's bankruptcy exit plan are ""even closer"" to a settlement over claims that the company fueled a U.S. opioid epidemic.
The mediator asked a bankruptcy judge to extend the deadline for negotiations to Feb. 16 from Feb. 7, saying that the two sides need more time to finalize a deal that would involve ""substantial"" additional money from the Sacklers, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. The new settlement would also include non-monetary concessions. 
The Sacklers had previously agreed to pay $4.3 billion in Purdue's bankruptcy case in return for sweeping legal protections that would have shielded the family from future opioid lawsuits. The states that had opposed the deal argued that the Sacklers were not paying enough to address their role in the harms caused by the opioid crisis.
Purdue, the maker of the highly addictive opioid pain drug OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and wealthy Sackler family members who owned the company of helping cause the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing that played down addiction and overdose risks.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing.
Any additional contribution from the Sacklers would be used exclusively for abatement of the opioid crisis, including support and services for survivors, victims, and their families, according to the mediator's report.
Over the next week the mediator, U.S. bankruptcy judge Shelley Chapman, intends to invite additional stakeholders into the negotiations, according to her interim report.
The mediator has already sought input from certain junior creditors of Purdue and representatives of opioid victims who have filed claims in the case, according to the report filed on Tuesday.
The current round of mediation includes representatives for the Raymond Sackler and Mortimer Sackler branches of the Sackler family, as well as eight states including California, Connecticut and Washington. Purdue is based in Stamford, Connecticut.
Purdue said on Tuesday that a settlement that would help alleviate the opioid crisis is ""more needed than ever.""
A representative for the Mortimer Sackler family declined to comment on Tuesday. A representative for the Raymond Sackler family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In December, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon upended the $4.3 billion settlement, finding that the bankruptcy court did not have legal authority to approve the protections for the Sacklers because they had not sought bankruptcy for themselves.

Several members of the Sackler family testified during Purdue's bankruptcy trial that their contribution to the settlement was conditioned on receiving ""global peace"" from opioid litigation. 
Purdue and the Sacklers have appealed McMahon's decision to the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. The 2nd Circuit is expected to hear the appeal on April 25.

The company's guidance for their fiscal Q4 calls for revenue of $204-$206 million, vs. expectations of $204.18M, and a loss of $.19-$.22, vs. expectations of a -$.05 loss.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's largest stock market operator, TMX Group, plans to launch its first cryptocurrency futures product in response to institutional investors' desire to offset the risks of trading in the relatively new asset class, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.
The group, which had 17 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of Dec. 31, aims to release the product on the Montreal Exchange this year, John McKenzie said in an interview after TMX posted fourth-quarter results on Monday. 
""More institutional investors and dealers are... holding more crypto assets within their portfolios or for their clients or in ETFs,"" he said. ""In crypto there's a lot of price volatility so (they're looking at) how they manage that exposure."" 
TMX, the operator of the Toronto stock and Montreal derivatives exchanges, listed the world's first bitcoin ETF almost a year ago.
Cryptocurrency assets have posted steep declines in recent months as investors fled risk assets amid expectations of interest rate increases by central banks. They have recovered some of those losses in recent weeks.
TMX is responding to a broader increase in interest in cryptocurrencies from investors and firms. On Monday, KPMG in Canada added Bitcoin and Ethereum to its corporate treasury, calling cryptocurrencies a ""maturing asset class that investors are increasingly gaining exposure to"" and said it expects them to become ""a regular part of the asset mix."" 
Online trading platform Wealthsimple, which currently offers trading of cryptocurrencies, told Reuters it aims to eventually enable their real-world use.

TMX is not modeling the futures product on any other offering, but existing regulations around futures products should cover it, McKenzie said, adding the company has no current plans to make it available to retail investors.
TMX Group reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of C$1.77 per share from C$1.43 a year ago and increased its quarterly dividend 8% to 83 Canadian cents.

Investing.com - Stocks staged a rally on Tuesday in the face of higher bond yields, with financials and small-caps driving the action and tech companies keeping pace. Tuesday also marked a rare down day for oil, as West Texas Intermediate notched a second-straight down day before the API inventories report came in with a surprise inventory draw.
While the CPI report looms on Thursday, tomorrow's market sees a number of major companies set to report. Here are three that should draw interest both for their own outlooks and for what they say about the broader state of the economy and market.
Disney (NYSE:DIS) is set to report after the bell tomorrow. The media giant is expected to post $20.27B in revenue, nearly 25% ahead of last year’s number, with earnings expected to be $.73/share, well ahead of 2020’s Q4 (fiscal Q1 2021 for Disney). Disney+ will remain in the spotlight, with expectations of 8.5M subscriber adds for the streaming service. Disney faces a tough tape given their muted October quarter, where they added 2.1M subscribers, and Netflix’s similarly muted most recent quarter and guidance.
On the other hand, Disney can hope that the rest of their business, especially theme parks, is starting to pick up or at least seeing light on the other side of the Omicron wave. Disney is trading about 30% off of 52-week highs and about even with late 2019 levels, which was when the company rode its first Disney+ launch momentum, so a twist in the story would be most welcome for shareholders.
Ride share and mobility company Uber (NYSE:UBER) also reports earnings tomorrow after the market close. Uber is expected to report 69% year over year revenue growth and guide for a further 102% revenue growth for Q1 2022. Profits are not yet expected for Uber.
The company’s guidance should shed light on the level of ‘reopening’ activity and thus need for rides and moving people around, and on the other hand how sticky the food delivery (and everything delivery) demand will be in a reopening environment, and a competitive one at that. Uber also has an Investor Day scheduled for Thursday where they are likely to set long-term targets, so there will be a lot for investors to work through.
CVS (NYSE:CVS) reports earnings before market hours tomorrow, with the pharmacy and healthcare company expected to post $75.63B in revenue, 8.7% ahead of last year’s quarter, and earnings of $1.82/share, well ahead of last year’s $1.3/share number.
Given CVS’s position as both a leading pharmacy chain and a healthcare provider via their Aetna unit, their commentary on the current Covid environment on both the cost side for healthcare companies and the demand side will provide a useful read-through for investors."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Cerberus placed 15 million shares in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), a term sheet from the investment bank running the sale showed on Tuesday, making it the second time within a month that the U.S. investment fund sold shares in Germany's largest lender.
The latest sale by Cerberus, which currently holds 1.99% in Deutsche Bank, equates to a stake of around 0.73% and would cut the fund's holding to roughly 1.26%.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the bookrunner, said Cerberus' shares were successfully placed with institutional investors at 14.15 euros per share, a discount of 1.6% to Tuesday's closing price and resulting in proceeds of about 212 million euros ($242 million).
The bank's stock is up more than 30% so far this year.
The sale comes after Cerberus sold a stake of around 1% in the bank in January. Sources have told Reuters that further sales were expected. 

Cerberus has agreed to a 30-day lock-up in Deutsche Bank, during which it will not sell additional stakes, Morgan Stanley said and the placement is expected to settle on Feb. 11, 2022.

Investing.com - Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) shares rose 8.2% in post-earnings trading after the company met revenue expectations and earnings came in well ahead of estimates.
The restaurant operator reported $1.96B in revenue, in line with analyst estimates and 24% growth on last year. Adjusted earnings were $5.58/share, ahead of $5.29 estimates. Diluted earnings were $4.69/share.
The company also posted an impressive 15.2% comparable restaurant sales increase. Digital sales only grew 3.8%, while operating margins grew to 8.1% from a prior 7.3%. Chipotle opened 78 new restaurants in the quarter.
""2021 was an outstanding year for Chipotle, highlighting the strength and resiliency of our brand."" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chipotle. ""Moving forward, we believe expanding access and convenience through our digital ecosystem, accelerating unit growth, and continuing to develop and support our restaurant employees, will put us in a much stronger competitive position.""
The company's 2022 outlook calls for 235-250 new restaurants opening (vs. 215 in 2021). They expect mid to high single digits comparable restaurant sales growth in Q1, and cited Omicron as weighing on comps in both December and in an ""intensifying"" manner in January.
Shares may be getting a charge from Chipotle's longer-term guidance, which includes raising the goal of potential Chipotle restaurants in North America to 7,000 from a prior goal of 6,000. Chipotle is aiming for 8-10% annual unit growth as part of this new guidance. The company currently has 2,966 restaurants globally. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden publicly acknowledged the role of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing on Tuesday, after Chief Executive Elon Musk repeatedly complained about being ignored.
""From iconic companies like GM and Ford building out new electric vehicle production to Tesla, our nation's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, to innovative younger companies,"" Biden said, adding other start-ups and saying manufacturing is coming ""back to America after decades."" 
Biden wants to give union-made, American-built electric vehicles an additional $4,500 tax incentive, setting up a clash between automakers Tesla and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp without U.S. unionized workers on one side, and United Auto Workers-affiliated carmakers in Detroit on the other.
Musk also opposed government funding for subsidizing electric vehicle charging stations.
Last month, Biden met with General Motors (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra, and the White House has repeatedly praised the Detroit automaker's electric vehicle efforts, even though it is selling far fewer EVs than Tesla.
After Biden's met with Barra in January and tweeted a video of the two talking, Musk replied ""Starts with a T/Ends with an A/ESL in the middle"" and then compared Biden to a ""damp sock puppet.
In September, Musk said Biden's electric vehicle policy appeared to be controlled by labor unions. He also criticized Biden in August when he was not invited to a White House event.
""(They) didn't mention Tesla once and praised GM and Ford for leading the EV revolution. Does that sound maybe a little biased?"" Musk said during a panel discussion. ""Not the friendliest administration, seems to be controlled by unions.""

Asked in August whether the White House did not invite Musk because workers at Tesla are not unionized, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""I'll let you draw your own conclusion."" 
When asked about Biden’s Tesla namedropping on Tuesday, Psaki said ""We all know that Tesla is a major producer of electric vehicles,"" and added the White House sees ""huge opportunity” for the United States from the industry overall.

Investing.com -  Lyft  swung to profit in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the rebound in its ride sharing business fell short of expectations following omicron-fueled disruptions.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell 3% in afterhours trading.
Lyft reported Q4 adjusted net income of $32.1 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $185.3 million year-on-year. Revenue rose to $969.9 million from $569.9 million. That compared with analysts estimates for revenue of $940.07 million. 
""Revenue per active rider, contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA all reached new highs in the fourth quarter, driven by improving service levels and higher ride volumes in our marketplace,"" said Elaine Paul, chief financial officer of Lyft.
Revenue per active rider jumped to $51.79 from $45.50 a year earlier as the number of active riders during the quarter climbed to 18.7 million from 12.6 million. That was below expectations for 20.1 million active riders.
The ride-hailing company also reported its maiden adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2021 of $92.9 million, compared with a loss of $755.2 million a year earlier.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 jumped Tuesday, as technology stocks staged an intraday recovery, and financials rode on the coattails of surging Treasury yields ahead of an inflation report later this week.   
The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1%, or 372 points, the Nasdaq added 1.3%.
The United States 10-Year yield briefly jumped to 1.97%, its highest level since August 2019, supported by ongoing bets for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively to curb inflation. 
Expectations for rate hike bets will come under the spotlight later this week, when the U.S. is expected to report Thursday that consumer inflations remains elevated.
The backdrop of rising yields paved the way for banking stocks to rack up gains with  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) leading the charge.
A rising rate environment boosts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Tech stocks were back in demand, led Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter reportedly considering an offer for cybersecurity company Mandiant, according to Bloomberg.
Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, however, struggled to turn the tide of negative bets following a more than 30% decline since reporting quarterly results last week.
Chip stocks also played a role in steadying the broader tech sector, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) paring early-day losses after walking away from its $40 billion deal to acquire UK chipmaker ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), citing “significant regulatory challenges.”
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF), and  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON) also pushed chip stocks higher, with latter rallying nearly 6% after reporting quarterly results and guidance topped Wall Street estimates.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was a major drag on healthcare stocks after it reported fourth quarter results that missed estimates on the top line, while guidance also fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The pharmaceutical giant raised its guidance on vaccine revenue for 2022, by $1 billion to $32 billion, but that still was below analysts’ forecast of $33.79 billion.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), meanwhile, slumped 12% after Reuters reported that the company had only supplied a small number of the 2 billion COVID-19 shots targeted for this year, leading some countries to reassess their planned usage of the vaccines.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) cut its full-year revenue outlook after swinging to a quarterly loss. Shares of the connected fitness equipment company surged 25%, however, after revealing that its chief executive Jack Foley would be stepping down.
The company also announced 2,800 job cuts as part of a restricting program that some see as a move to boost its attractiveness for a sale, with Amazon,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and other suitors rumored to be circling.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Technology industry executive Barry McCarthy is an avid user of a Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) bike and now the stakes for his workouts are rising as he becomes chief executive with a goal to restore the fitness company's lost luster.
McCarthy cemented his credentials in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street when he worked alongside company founders as chief financial officer at subscription-based streaming companies Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology.
Now those skills will be put to the test as he replaces Peloton co-founder John Foley in the top position and tries to recoup billions of dollars in value erased over the last year. 
Investors welcomed his arrival by pushing Peloton's stock price up 30% on Tuesday, more than the gains from news that Peloton was a possible takeover target. 
Dan Rosensweig, chief executive officer of student services company Chegg (NYSE:CHGG), where McCarthy had served as a director, called him a ""perfect choice"" to lead Peloton into its next chapter.
""McCarthy will help right the financial and unit economics, and his background in entertainment, education, music, and fashion will help expand the value of the Peloton consumer base,"" Rosensweig told Reuters, adding that his expertise in subscription models and understanding a company's financials made him an obvious choice for the position.
But McCarthy, who retired as Spotify's chief financial officer in 2019, will face steep challenges in repairing a company whose value had surged to $50 billion during the pandemic and then tumbled to around $9 billion as gyms began reopening and rival companies offered similar products.
Last year, Peloton's stock price tumbled 76% and much of the blame was heaped on Foley, who has been criticized for bloated costs and poor decision making.
Foley will shift into the executive chairman role. Peloton said it will add two other board members, eliminate 2,800 jobs and cut capital expenditures this year.
Hugely popular instructors will stay.
In an earlier earnings call, Foley called McCarthy ""a longtime passionate Peloton member who shares our team's enthusiasm for our company's vision of improving lives through home fitness.""
Some investors worry that McCarthy's ability to operate might be constrained by the company's two classes of stock, which will effectively allow insiders to control it, and that Foley will still be in the boardroom.
But for now, Wall Street analysts believe McCarthy will be a stabilizing influence on a company that was one of the darlings of the pandemic.
""We believe (McCarthy) will provide a steady hand to (Peloton) as it works to re-build demand while rightsizing the business,"" analysts at JP Morgan wrote in a note on Tuesday, adding McCarthy will be a welcome surprise who will prove positive for the share price, in the short and long term.

Setting a path for the future will offer challenges, especially as Peloton tries to reignite excitement for its pricey bikes.
""Something Peloton's new CEO must consider is that the company is not just equipment or one-time purchases, but membership, including community and content offerings. Peloton needs people to start, stick, and stay to be successful in the long run,"" said Mark DiMassimo, founder and creative chief of creative agency DiGo.

Icahn, who turns 86 next week, takes large stakes in companies before pressuring management to make changes he believes will benefit shareholders.
The billionaire is pushing McDonald's to treat pigs better, expecting the use of gestation crates to be banned altogether, the report https://on.wsj.com/34ugStX said, adding he recently bought around 100 shares in the restaurant company. The report did not say when he threatened to run a proxy fight.
McDonald's said in a statement it has maintained an active dialogue with Icahn about its goal of creating a U.S. supply chain free of gestational stalls for confirmed pregnant sows.
It had previously expected to source pork only from suppliers that do not use gestation stalls for housing pregnant sow by the end of 2022. On Tuesday, it said it would reach its goal by the end of 2024. 
""Industry-wide challenges for farmers and producers – including the impacts of global swine disease outbreaks and the COVID-19 pandemic – have delayed our producers ability to meet our 2012 pork commitment on our original timeline,"" McDonald's said.

(Reuters) -Harley-Davidson Inc reported on Tuesday a sharp jump in revenue and an unexpected profit for the fourth quarter, boosted by price hikes and a shift toward sales of higher-margin touring and cruiser motorcycles, sending its shares up nearly 15%.
In the midst of nearly a two-year sales drop, Harley reset its strategy in 2020 to focus on selling its high-margin Touring, large Cruiser and Trike bikes to older and wealthier customers in markets such as the United States and Europe.
The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company's earnings beat can be partially attributed to higher pricing and surcharges that have helped buoy its bike sales amid surging raw materials prices and volatile supply chains.
Harley's overall growth outlook assumes that supply chain woes will start to ease heading into the second half of this year.
""We expect revenue to be positively impacted by our global pricing actions as we work to offset the cost headwinds across the supply chain, Harley Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter told analysts on a conference call.
Price inflation and surcharges have been limited to the United States, but company executives said stronger pricing dynamics will be rolled out to global markets in the new fiscal year.
""While the demand is there, the supply isn’t, so it seems like the consumer will bear the burden of covering it, said Jaime Katz, senior analyst at Morningstar.
Harley reported revenue from motorcycle and related products of $816 million, compared to analysts' estimates of $663.8 million and $531 million in the year-earlier period. Total revenue was $1.02 billion, up from $725 million.
Retail sales in the United States, the company's biggest market, rose to 18,855 units from 17,274 units.
Net income jumped to $21.6 million, or 14 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $96.4 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a loss of 38 cents per share in the most recent quarter, according to Refinitiv.
Harley's shares were up 14.5% to $41.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company continues to cater to its wealthier customer base. Its model mix, including the large Cruiser, Trike bikes, and sold-out units of its Pan America model, has been crucial to maintaining solid U.S. and European sales. The Pan America 1250 special has a starting price tag of $19,999. 
North American retail sales were up 8% in the fourth quarter compared with last year, driven in part by 23% growth in sales of adventure touring models as well as solid sales of Harley's Pan America and Sportster S bikes.

""From the outset, we saw the potential in the adventure touring category – as of today, it is the second-fastest growing category in North America, Harley Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz said on the call.
Harley's full-year revenue for motorcycle and related products was $4.5 billion, up 39% from $3.3 billion in 2020. Total revenue for 2021 was $5.3 billion, up 32% from $4.1 billion in the previous year.

Investing.com — Barclays analyst Jiong Shao started coverage of Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO),  Xpeng Inc  (NYSE:XPEV), and Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI) with overweight ratings on Tuesday, telling investors in a note that the companies have an ""opportunity to not only take a sizable market share of the domestic auto market"" but also ""build a dominant position on the world stage.""
Shao pointed to China's electric vehicle market for his rating, explaining that it is the largest globally, with about a 25 to 30% global share of units sold per annum.
""It is a national priority for China to develop cutting-edge EV and autonomous driving technologies, and to export competitive EVs around the world, as Chinese smartphone manufacturers have done in recent years. Several leading EV makers have already started selling their products in Europe,” Shao stated.
Speaking on each company individually, the analyst said that concerns regarding NIO's growth ""should be somewhat alleviated now"" as the company is set to double production capacity at its current factory in March. Shao has a $34 price target on NIO shares which are up 2.38% to $24.56 Tuesday.
Shao has a $38 price target on Li Auto, whose shares are up 0.7% Tuesday. However, he questioned the company's current one-model strategy, saying he doesn't think it will work, and pointed to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an example of an outlier in the realm. 
""Apple is an outlier in that it can more or less maintain its one-model strategy (we don’t count different colors or memory sizes as different models), while most companies including Ford and TLSA cannot stick to that strategy for very long,"" stated Shao. ""Apple is a closed system and thus has the luxury to “tell” consumers what they want or need. Most products fit in an open system marketplace.”
Concluding his note with comments on XPeng, Shao explained that the company's hybrid approach to store ownership — having some self-owned stores and some third-party dealers — is ""sensible given XPEV’s market positioning.”
The analyst put a $45 price target on XPeng shares, which declined 0.2% Tuesday."

(Reuters) -Amgen Inc said on Tuesday it would buy back up to $6 billion of its shares in the first quarter and forecast profit to more than double by 2030 on strong sales of its oncology drugs, biosimilars and other important products.
Shares of the U.S. biotechnology company jumped 8% to $241.37. 
Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) also said it expects to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade, driven by treatments such as cholesterol drug Repatha, psoriasis medicine Otezla and a pipeline of innovative products in development. 
""This is very far out into 2030 ... many things could change with pipelines, pricing, commercial situations,"" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note.
Amgen commercial operations head Murdo Gordon, in a phone interview, said Amgen is confident in its long-term forecast given the company's strong track record and diverse product portfolio.
""We see price pressure in a fairly significant way in 2022, then going forward that price drag is a little lower, and we see volume gains from the innovative side of our portfolio more than offsetting price declines,"" he said.
The company also said it may take advantage of the recent selloff in biotech stocks to pursue deals in the sector. 
""It's not lost on us that the recent decline in valuations for many biotech assets could create more compelling opportunities for us,"" long-time Chief Executive Robert Bradway said at the company's business review meeting with investors.
""We have the financial strength, the flexibility to consider a wide range of possibilities.""
For this year, Amgen projected revenue of $25.4 billion to $26.5 billion, which was short of the nearly $27 billion forecast by Wall Street, as compiled by Refinitiv.
Yee at Jefferies estimated that around 46% of Amgen's current product sales, including osteoporosis drug Prolia, are at risk of losing market exclusivity by 2030 as patents expire.

Amgen on Monday detailed a series of early-stage pipeline assets it believes hold promise, including a cholesterol-targeting treatment and a potential obesity drug for heart patients.

The halt is temporary, with the plant in the Dutch city of Leiden expected to start making the vaccine again after a few months, according to the report.
The plant has instead been making an experimental but potentially more profitable vaccine to protect against an unrelated virus, the NYT reported. 
J&J currently has millions of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in inventory, the company said in an email, adding that it continues to provide all its fill-and-finish sites with drug substance required to produce its shot. 
""We continue to fulfill our contractual obligations in relation to the COVAX Facility and the African Union,"" J&J said. 
The NYT report, however, said with the Leiden plant temporarily unavailable, it could reduce the supply of the J&J vaccine by a few hundred million doses. 
Other facilities have been tapped to manufacture the vaccine but they are either not up and running or are yet to receive regulatory approval to make the shot, the report added. 

The drugmaker last month forecast about $3.5 billion in sales from its COVID-19 vaccine in 2022. 
That is a 46% jump from its sales of $2.39 billion in 2021, a year marked by manufacturing stumbles, safety concerns and uneven demand for a vaccine once touted as a promising tool for inoculating populations in hard-to-reach areas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia on Tuesday advised the owners of 484,000 U.S. vehicles to park outside and away from other vehicles because of fire risks until they get new recall repairs completed.
Hyundai Motor Co and its affiliate Kia Corp announced separate U.S. recalls because a Hydraulic Electronic Control Unit (HECU) module could malfunction and cause an electrical short, which could result in an engine compartment fire. Dealers will install a new fuse for the circuit board to address the fire risks.
The new recalls cover some 2014-2016 Kia Sportage, 2016-2018 Kia K900 and 2016-2018 Hyundai Santa Fe vehicles. Owners should park vehicles outdoors and away from other vehicles or structures, even if vehicles are turned off.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urged owners to follow the automakers advise, saying ""the manufacturers believe an electrical component in the anti-lock brake system may experience an internal electrical short circuit that could increase the risk of fire both while the vehicle is being driven or parked.""
The recalls covers 126,747 Kia vehicles and 357,830 Hyundai vehicles. There are no reports of injuries but 11 total reports of fires, the automakers said.
The Korean automakers have issued and expanded several recalls in recent years for fire risks.

In November, NHTSA issued first-ever reward to a whistleblower, handing out more than $24 million to a former Hyundai employee who reported to NHTSA in 2016 that Hyundai was failing to address a design flaw linked to its Theta II engines, which were prone to seizing up and catching fire.
In 2020, Hyundai and Kia's U.S. units agreed to a record $210 million civil penalty after NHTSA said they failed to recall vehicles for engine issues in a timely fashion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices near seven-year highs will likely weigh on the U.S. economy and push inflation pressures down over the next year, star stock picker Cathie Wood of ARK Invest said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
Wood, who became a household name by betting on high-valuation, high-growth stocks that soared during the early stages of the pandemic, remains one of the few prominent fund managers who say that deflation, rather than inflation, will be a driving force in the U.S. economy and stock market over the next few years. 
Concerns about inflation have weighed heavily on Wood's portfolio of stocks as rising interest rate costs cut into the valuations investors appear willing to pay for companies. 
Yet advances in technology will likely push productivity rates higher, outweighing any gains in wages, Wood said. 
""We have a very strong point of view that productivity gains we will witness over the next five to 10 years will be astonishing. We think productivity will increase 5%-plus, and we won’t have an inflation problem,"" she said. 
Wood's flagship $12 billion ARK Innovation Fund was down 0.9% in afternoon trading Tuesday. The fund has large positions in companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. 

The fund was down 23.4% for the year-to-date through Monday, putting its performance near the bottom of the 607 U.S. mid-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar. The benchmark S&P 500 index was down 5.2% over the same time. 
Investors pulled nearly $148 million from the ARK Innovation Fund for the year-to-date through Feb. 2, according to Lipper data.

BOSTON (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital is urging 7-Eleven's owner, Seven & i Holdings, to break up its businesses and focus on the convenience-store chain, steps which it says could more than double the company's share price in the coming years.
U.S.-based investment firm ValueAct, which has been urging the Japanese company's board to take bolder action for months, made its proposal public on Tuesday as investors have become more frustrated with the company's lagging share price.
ValueAct says that if Seven & i narrows its focus to 7-Eleven, it could become a global champion in a growing industry, and warns that if its attention remains ""scattered"" its results will be poor for many shareholders.
ValueAct, which owns a 4.4% stake in Seven & i, said it is making its presentation public, a rare step for the investment firm, because management's responses to its private discussions have been ""indecisive, unclear, and unsatisfactory.""
Last month ValueAct first said publicly that Seven & i should explore strategic alternatives and added some pressure to its request by saying that it wanted a public response to its requests soon. It also asked the company to contact the top 30 shareholders and listen to their views.
ValueAct said that it is among a number of investment firms, including Third Point, Third Avenue Management and Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM), which have tried to push for changes at Seven & i and have received unsatisfactory responses. 
Since 2007, Seven & i's stock price has been the most sluggish performer, returning only 4.6%, compared with competitors like Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has been the leader in the space, gaining 18.5%.

ValueAct warned that competition is heating up by the day and that many competitors including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and DoorDash are ramping up plans to sell snacks and groceries in convenience stores. 
""Focus is urgently needed to ensure that 7-Eleven can win in the coming decades,"" the ValueAct presentation said.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc said on Tuesday its after-tax distributable earnings more than doubled in the fourth quarter, thanks to strong asset sales from its private equity portfolio and record transaction fees from its capital markets business.
The strong earnings performance, in line with that of KKR's peers, reflects a record-breaking dealmaking year in 2021 that was driven by buoyant markets, access to cheap capital, and the economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc both reported record fourth-quarter earnings, as the buyout firms took advantage of the favorable environment to sell assets at top dollar.
But investors are bracing for a more uncertain market climate this year after the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its intention to raise interest rates and end its bond-buying program in an effort to curb rising inflation.
KKR said it remains positive notwithstanding the expected rise in rates, and added that some of its business segments, particularly its credit business and Global Atlantic insurance franchise, will benefit from any rise in the cost of capital. 
""Our expectation is that we can be in an environment here where real rates are still low or negative over the next couple of years, which I think is an overall positive place for us to be from a business model perspective,"" KKR Chief Financial Officer Robert Lewin said during an analyst call on Tuesday.
KKR's shares were down 7.6% at $65.37 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, tracking the share prices of its peers but underperforming the broader market, which was higher.
""It's just macro fears driving the selloff and fears around realizations. Part of it is also around messaging and targets on what they plan to do because for rates and inflation it's hard to say,"" said Jefferies analyst Gerald O'Hara.
STRONG EARNINGS
The New York-based firm said its after-distributable earnings, which represent the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to a record $1.4 billion compared with $544.1 million a year earlier. That translated to after-tax distributable earnings per share of $1.59, exceeding the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $1.21 per share, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
During the quarter, KKR generated $568.3 million as it booked profits from asset divestments, including the sale of its controlling interest in Max Healthcare, an Indian hospital chain operator, and a minority stake in Japan's Kokusai Electric. Transaction fees from its capital markets unit rose to $320 million, up 66% from $193 million a year earlier, driven mostly by infrastructure and private equity deals in North America.
KKR said it invested $23 billion to buy assets in the fourth quarter, including the acquisition of Norwegian ship-owning company Ocean Yield and a stake in South Korean energy company SK E&S Co Ltd.

Private equity portfolio rose 7% in the quarter and opportunistic real estate funds rose 4%, KKR said. Blackstone and Carlyle reported appreciation in their private equity funds of 4.8% and 6%, respectively. 
KKR's assets under management rose 2.6% during the quarter to $471 billion, driven by strong fundraising, while unspent capital was flat at $112 billion.

""The nation is dealing with inflation at its highest level in decades, much of it driven by corporate greed and anticompetitive behavior, and the federal government must use every tool available to prevent price gouging and reduce prices for Americans,"" Warren wrote in a letter dated Monday and sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland and his deputy, Lisa Monaco.
Price-fixing is a criminal violation and can lead to executives going to jail for months. Deferred prosecution agreements mean that defendants get charges dropped if they comply with certain demands from the prosecutor.
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Warren criticized, in particular, price-fixing deferred prosecution agreements that the department reached with Argos USA, a cement producer, and three generic drugs companies, Taro Pharmaceuticals, Novartis unit Sandoz, and Apotex.
Warren said the Argos deal was ""unusual particularly because the concrete industry has been rife with criminal antitrust issues for decades."" Regarding the deals with pharmaceutical companies, she said that ""none of the criminal executives will see any time in prison in spite of confessed illegal practices scamming the government and patients in need of drugs."" 
Warren asked Garland and Monaco for any data that the department kept regarding price-fixing enforcement efforts, including prison sentences that executives might be serving, penalties and restitution; information on how the Justice Department decides to enter into deferred prosecution agreements and whether the government has observed multiple instances of price-fixing in any industry and focused resources there. 

The Justice Department has prosecuted cases involving major companies in the past.
Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp , one of the largest U.S. poultry producers, pleaded guilty after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit and was sentenced to pay a $107.9 million fine in February 2021 to settle federal charges it conspired to fix chicken prices and passed on the costs to consumers and other purchasers.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Tuesday, as technology stocks found their footing following a rocky start to the week, while banking stocks led financials higher as 10-year yield flirted with fresh multi-year highs.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1%, or 360 points, the Nasdaq added 1%.
The United States 10-Year yield jumped to 1.97%, its highest level since August 2019, supported by ongoing bets for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively to curb inflation.
Expectations for rate hike bets will come under the spotlight later this week, when the U.S. is expected to report that consumer inflations remains elevated.
The backdrop of rising yields paved the way for banking stocks to rack up gains with  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) leading the charge.
A rising rate environment boosts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Tech stocks were back in demand, led Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, however, struggled to turn the tide of negative bets following a more than 30% decline since reporting quarterly results last week.
Chip stocks also played a role in steadying the broader tech sector, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) paring early-day losses after walking away from its $40 billion deal to acquire UK chipmaker ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), citing “significant regulatory challenges.”
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF), and  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON) also pushed chip stocks higher, with latter rallying nearly 5% after reporting quarterly results and guidance topped Wall Street estimates.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was a major drag on healthcare stocks after it reported fourth quarter results that missed estimates on the top line, while guidance also fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The pharmaceutical giant raised its guidance on vaccine revenue for 2022, by $1 billion to $32 billion, but that still was below analysts’ forecast of $33.79 billion.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), meanwhile, slumped 14% after Reuters reported that the company had only supplied a small number of the 2 billion COVID-19 shots targeted for this year, leading some countries to reassess their planned usage of the vaccines.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) cut its full-year revenue outlook after swinging to a quarterly loss. Shares of the connected fitness equipment company surged 25%, however, after revealing that its chief executive Jack Foley would be stepping down.
The company also announced 2,800 job cuts as part of a restricting program that some see as a move to boost its attractiveness for a sale, with Amazon,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and other suitors rumored to be circling.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) jumped more than 14% after swinging to a surprise profit in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by increased sales of higher margin motorcycles."

Ford has invested $100 million in the Kansas City Assembly Plant -- the company's first plant to assemble batteries and all-electric vehicles in-house.
The E-Transit is part of Ford's $30 billion investment in electrification through 2025 and becomes the company's latest electric vehicle after the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and F-150 Lightning Pro.
The company plans to have a global capacity to produce 600,000 battery-electric vehicles annually by 2023. However, it has recently been hit by chip supply constraints, which have forced it to suspend or slash production at eight of its factories in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.  
Today's announcement has had little impact on Ford's shares which are down 0.3% at the time of writing.

(Reuters) -Canada's Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) Inc posted a quarterly loss on Tuesday primarily due to non-cash impairment of C$1.9 billion ($1.50 billion) in the U.S. manufacturing segment, sending its shares lower.
The U.S. manufacturing business was hit by operational issues at two refineries, contributing to a net loss of C$408 million, or 21 Canadian cents, for the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of C$153 million, or 12 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.
Cenovus shares were last down 5.8% at C$15.43 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Rivals Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO) Ltd and Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc also missed quarterly profit expectations last week.
Despite the quarterly loss, which comes amid a surge in global oil prices to seven-year highs, Cenovus expects to rapidly reduce its net debt to C$8 billion and will soon share plans on increasing returns to shareholders, executives said on a conference call.
Cenovus's net debt was below C$9.6 billion at year end 2021.
The company is also in preliminary discussions with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) about the future of their 50-50 joint venture ownership of the Wood River, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, refineries in the U.S., said Cenovus chief executive Alex Pourbaix.
""When we're involved in refineries that are great refineries we would love to have 100% of it, all things being equal,"" Pourbaix said, adding there was no urgency and it was too early to speculate on what an alternative to the joint venture could look like.
Cenovus, which agreed to buy rival Husky last year to create Canada's No. 3 oil and gas producer, said total production stood at 825,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, up from 467,202 boepd a year earlier.

Downstream throughput, or the amount of crude processed, rose 469,900 barrels per day (bpd) from 169,000 bpd.

Leonardo Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said in March it was considering options for the division, including an alliance with a partner ready to take the bulk of the business. It has not placed a value on the Genoa-based division. 
In June, state-controlled Leonardo said it wanted to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the unit, which employs about 400 people, and safeguard staff levels.
No offer was able to ""deliver (Leonardo's) vision for the future of the automation business, which the company sees as a long-term project requiring investment in the development of automation skills and technologies,"" it said in a statement.

It also said it was ""committed to the city of Genoa"".

The search for a partner who could shoulder a re-launch for the automation business is part of a wider effort by Profumo to focus on Leonardo's core businesses including electronics for defence, helicopters and aircraft.

MILAN (Reuters) -Two activist investors in Generali (MI:GASI) are considering ending their accord to consult over decisions concerning Italy's biggest insurer, two sources close to the matter said, after the agreement drew regulatory scrutiny. 
Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle that has cast doubt on the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, whose term ends in April.
With the backing of Generali's biggest investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), the insurer's board has put Donnet forward for a third term, meeting opposition from two other leading investors.
Italian billionaires Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio who are, respectively, Generali's No.2 and No.3 shareholders, in September agreed to consult over decisions relating to the insurer with a view to promoting ""a more profitable and effective management"" of the group.
Smaller Generali investor Fondazione CRT later joined their pact.
Caltagirone unexpectedly quit the pact in January as he prepares to file a list of nominees for Generali's new board with an alternative CEO candidate.
Sources said at the time the move aimed to prevent regulatory checks on whether the agreement was a mere consultation pact or more substantial than that.
Now Del Vecchio and CRT are discussing dissolving the pact altogether, the sources said. Lawyers are studying the matter, one of the sources added.
SEEKING CHANGE
CRT said in a note it had discussed the issue at a meeting on Tuesday without taking a decision. The pact complies with existing rules and aims to help CRT to better evaluate its interests in relation to the upcoming Generali AGM, CRT said.
Even if it is dismantled, the group's common goal remains that of pushing for changes at Generali, one of the sources said on Tuesday. 
The discussions over scrapping the pact come after Generali last week asked industry supervisor IVASS to check whether the three investors should have gained clearance for their combined stake. 
The three hold in aggregate more than 16% of Generali based on the latest data available, after Del Vecchio and Caltagirone steadily upped their Generali stakes.

Both Caltagirone and a representative for Del Vecchio this year quit Generali's board in a move that freed them from disclosure obligations, barring the crossing of certain thresholds.
IVASS has the power to freeze the group's voting rights for the portion exceeding a 10% combined holding were it to ascertain the three should have sought authorisation for the stakebuilding.

MADRID (Reuters) -European buyout firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) is working with advisers to prepare the sale of French water management firm Saur in a deal that could value France's third-biggest water firm at about 3 billion euros ($3.43 billion), sources told Reuters.
EQT has hired Rothschild to sound out prospective bidders for its 70% stake in Saur ahead of an auction process that is expected to kick off later this year, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Stockholm-listed investment firm, led by Christian Sinding, is looking to cash out for about 3 billion euros after it took control of Saur in 2018 in a deal that saw BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) keeping a minority stake in the business, the sources said.
Saur had net revenue of 1.7 billion euros last year and operates in 20 countries, serving about 20 million people worldwide.
German utility firm Rethmann Group is eyeing a possible bid for the Paris-based firm as it seeks to expand its operations in France after buying a 34% stake in transport firm Transdev from Veolia in 2019, one of the sources said.
Rethmann, which is active in water management through its Remondis unit, is expected to face competition from cash-rich infrastructure funds who see the company's stable cash flow and long-term contracts with roughly 9,500 local authorities and industrial clients as a safe bet. 
EQT and Rethmann Group were not available for comment while Rothschild declined to comment.
The move comes as French waste and water management giants Veolia and Suez are in the process of finalising a tie-up that would create a national champion.
For infrastructure funds water management is a lucrative industry, with EU countries spending an estimated 100 billion euros per year on water supply and sanitation, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Under EQT's ownership Saur has scaled up its business overseas with acquisitions in Portugal and the Netherlands.
The 89-year old company is also present in Saudi Arabia, Britain and Poland as well as in Spain where its local subsidiary Gestagua could be used as a possible platform to access South American markets, its Chief Executive Patrick Blethon told Spanish media on Feb. 7.

Saur refinanced its debt in September when it issued sustainability-linked bonds worth 950 million euros and secured a senior revolving credit facility of 250 million euros.

The truck, bus and engine maker completed a spin-off process from former parent CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) and listed at the beginning of this year, under Chief Executive Gerrit Marx.
Presenting 2021 results, Marx told analysts the supply chain issues and component shortages hit preformance in the second half of last year and particularly in the fourth quarter.
""We expect a gradual recovery to normality during the first half of 2022 regarding the supply chain issues,"" Marx said. 
Shares closed down 3.7%, among the worst performers in Milan's blue-chip basket. 
Net revenues of industrial activities grew 21% in 2021 to 15.52 billion euros ($17.7 billion) on a pro-forma basis, while Marx said the company expected them to rise ""up to 5%"" in 2022.
Adjusted operating profit from industrial activities stood at 302 million euros versus a 89 million euro loss in 2020, with increased production costs, driven by supply chain constraints and higher raw material prices, which had a 241 million euro negative impact. 
Cash generation was negative by 125 million euros last year.
""Raw material prices and supply chain issues have the power to affect out margins at least in the first part of this year,"" Chief Financial Officer Francesco Tanzi told analysts.
In the business plan unveiled in November, Iveco targeted revenue of 16.5 billion-17.5 billion euros by 2026.
CNH Industrial, which presented its last quarterly results before splitting from Iveco that showed a 23% drop in operating profit, said on Tuesday it saw protracted supply chain issues this year.
CEO Scott Wine said the group had to manage supply chain issues in the fourth quarter and specifically microchip shortages.
But the company saw net sales from industrial activities grow 30% last year, topping its forecast, and generated a free cashflow of more than $1.75 billion in the period.
As it focused on agriculture and construction machinery after the Iveco demerger, CNH guided for an increase in net sales from industrial activities of 10%-14% this year. 
Shares in CNH, which proposed a dividend of 0.28 euros per share, closed up 2.45%.

Investing.com — Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced Tuesday that it will launch Tap to Pay on iPhone in the US later this year. The tech giant said the feature will allow merchants to use their iPhone as a contactless payment terminal to accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a tap to their iPhone.
There is no additional hardware or payment terminal needed for the feature which uses NFC technology. It will be available on iPhone XS or later devices, with payment platforms and app developers able to integrate into their iOS apps and offer it as a payment option to their business customers.
The company highlighted that Apple Pay is already accepted by more than 90 percent of US retailers. They also confirmed Stripe will be the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay to their business customers, including the Shopify Point of Sale app this spring. 
""As more and more consumers are tapping to pay with digital wallets and credit cards, Tap to Pay on iPhone will provide businesses with a secure, private, and easy way to accept contactless payments,"" stated Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.
There had been worries that the feature could compete with Square's Point of Sale app. However, as mentioned by Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assad, the press release suggests the new payment feature ""may not be a competitive threat"" to the Square app and may in fact be an additive. El-Assad added that it should ""put to rest investor fears"" that Apple will roll out a competing payments solution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday opposed a bid by families of people killed in two Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX crashes asking a judge to declare that the government violated their legal rights when it reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the plane maker last year to resolve a criminal charge.
Despite opposing the families' request, the department said in a court filing that ""the government apologizes for not meeting and conferring with these crash victims' beneficiaries before entering into"" the deferred prosecution agreement - a type of corporate plea deal. It also said it had ""no legal obligation"" to hold such a meeting.
The settlement, reached in January 2021 near the end of former President Donald Trump's administration, capped a 21-month government investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019, that killed a total of 346 people.
Boeing also will oppose the families' legal requests, the Justice Department said in the filing. Boeing declined comment. 
In the filing, the department explained its decision not to take Boeing to a trial on a criminal charge of conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that regulates Boeing and evaluated its airliners.
""There was no doubt that Boeing had conspired to defraud the federal government when it deceived the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group,"" the filing said. 
""The government's investigation, however, did not produce evidence that it believed would allow it to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what factors had caused the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302,"" it added, referring to the two fatal flights.
Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, criticized the Justice Department's position that relatives of those killed in the crashes do not qualify as ""crime victims"" under federal law. 
""The Department of Justice's claim that the families are not the 'victims' of Boeing's crimes is unconscionable and unsupportable,"" Cassell said in a statement.
The families in December asked Texas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor to declare that the deferred prosecution agreement was negotiated in violation of their rights as crime victims under federal law and to set a briefing schedule on the appropriate remedies. 
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Jan. 26 met with some of the family members. 
The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it is working to revise its internal policies and guidelines to ""ensure that if this situation arises in the future, consultation and notice will occur."" It also apologized that its own victims' rights ombudsman in February 2020 ""conveyed inaccurate information"" to representatives of the families. 
The settlement allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution, and included a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million fund for crash victims over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design.
The Justice Department said that $471 million - 94% of the $500 million - has been disbursed to relatives of 326 of the 346 crash victims.

A former chief technical pilot for Boeing was charged last October with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. He has denied wrongdoing.
The crashes, which cost Boeing some $20 billion and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane that ended in 2020, prompted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation reforming new airplane certification.

The first phase of the pilot plan will add 250 electric vehicles to the app and is set to be completed in the first quarter, according to a statement published by Uber.
Adding those vehicles, rather than petrol vehicles, will save an average of 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, the equivalent of planting 250,000 trees, said Roberto Rocha, VEMO's general director. 
Uber said the company aims to become a zero-emission platform globally by 2040, the same date the Mexican government forecasts that all its marketed vehicles will be electric. 
The company said last year that it is using the ""Uber Planet"" offer scheme in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Costa Rica alongside efforts to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles due to the weak nascent EV market in the region.

The U.S. car hailing app started to offer Mexican customers an ""Uber Planet"" option in February 2021, which allows them to contribute towards the purchase of carbon credits for different projects to offset the emissions caused by their rides for 0.37 pesos ($0.0179).

616,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 12:46PM ET</span>",Indigo's Franke bets on winning cost formula for Frontier-Spirit airline,"By Chibuike Oguh and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Veteran budget airline investor Bill Franke has pledged to avoid what he once called the ""path to hell"" after masterminding a $2.9 billion merger of discount airlines - letting dealmaking get the better of tight cost controls that support low fares.
The 84-year-old entrepreneur has turned his private equity firm's initial $36 million in Frontier Group Holdings into a stake worth $2.4 billion in the agreed merger with  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc - a rare feat in high-risk airline deals.
On Monday, Frontier and Spirit unveiled their plans to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline, valuing Florida-based Spirit at about $2.9 billion excluding debt.
After spearheading the low-cost strategy at both airlines - having previously served as a chairman and key shareholder of Spirit and now Frontier - Franke is no in mood to relax the simple formula that underpins his investments on three continents.
""The trick is being disciplined about cost structure,"" Franke told Reuters in an interview.
Franke has long been a pioneer of ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit, which occupy a tier of the market below long-established budget rivals like Southwest.
Such airlines rely on offering a fare stripped back to its lowest possible level, topped up by charges for extras like booking through a call center, a strategy known as unbundling.
The business also keeps a laser focus on serving tourism or visits to relatives, without chasing after business travelers.
Such carriers were among the first to recover from the pandemic.
""There's been a rebound in booking in the U.S. though most of them is the class we call visiting family and friends rather than business travel,"" Franke said.
""We're optimistic because there is pent-up demand. Consumers still like to pay low prices.""
BUSINESS MODEL
The pledge to maintain low costs and fares appears directed in part at U.S. regulators who will closely review the merger deal, amid increased scepticism about takeovers under the Biden administration, according to lawyers.
But it also reflects Franke's reluctance to make compromises on the business model purely for the sake of expansion - a message unlikely to be lost on other airlines in which his investment firm owns shares, like Europe's Wizz Air. 
While Frontier, Spirit and Wizz all have similar business strategies, Wizz Air triggered concerns among some analysts about its ability to expand without losing control of costs when it made an approach to Britain's easyJet (LON:EZJ) last year.
EasyJet rejected the approach and Wizz Air, which never confirmed the move, subsequently said it preferred organic growth without being ""blind"" to other opportunities.
Franke began his airline career at then-bankrupt America West Airlines, which later acquired U.S. Airways and was then bought out by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
His airline-focused buyout firm, Indigo Partners, owns stakes in Wizz Air, JetSMART of Chile and Mexico's Volaris, as well as 83% of Colorado-based Frontier, valued at $2.7 billion. 
It is expected to own about 43% in the combined entity following the merger of Frontier and Spirit.
Indigo, which Franke founded in 2002, paid $36 million to acquire ownership and assume the debt of Frontier from Republic Airways Holdings Inc in 2013 after selling shares in Spirit. 
Franke rebranded Frontier as a low-cost, no-frills carrier, flying its jets for longer hours and eliminating some destinations served by major U.S. airlines.
Indigo took Frontier public in April 2021 after the airline grew to become a U.S. regional player and following the COVID-19 pandemic, which had upended air travel worldwide. 

Frontier was valued at $4.5 billion in that offering, which raised $300 million for the airline and another $300 million for Indigo. It closed on Monday at $12.82 per share, for a market value of $2.8 billion - still a 66-fold gain on Franke's gamble.

(Reuters) - When the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co reports its holiday-quarter results on Wednesday, Wall Street analysts will study whether the popular Star Wars bounty hunter Boba Fett, The Beatles and Marvel superhero Hawkeye reignited subscriber growth at the company's Disney+ streaming service.
A strong showing will go a long way toward restoring confidence in the sector, which suffered a blow after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) forecast weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth, erasing much of the company’s stock market gains during the pandemic.
Disney will need to hit or exceed the 8.5 million new subscribers it is expected to have attracted, according to Factset estimates. That would bring the total to about 127 million as of the end of calendar 2021, or roughly half of Disney's 2024 goals.
It attracted a mere 2.1 million new subscribers in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 2, the fewest since Disney+ launched in November 2019, foreshadowing a slowdown in the overall market. Netflix’s report in January underscored the dim view and raised questions about the long-term profitability of the streaming business.
“A key investor concern is the growth trajectory of Disney+ and ability to reach fiscal year 2024 guidance,” wrote Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich.
During its fiscal first quarter, Disney released ""Get Back,"" a documentary with previously unseen footage of The Beatles working together in 1969, plus the ""Hawkeye"" series and the first episode of ""The Book of Boba Fett."" 
Disney has forecast that it will reach 230 million to 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, guidance it reaffirmed in November.
While Disney’s streaming business is a major focus, Ehrlich told Reuters that performance at Disney’s theme parks, long a driver of the company’s earnings, may be poised for a rebound.
“We’ve been hearing how strong attendance was,” Ehrlich said. “We know there’s huge pent-up demand.”
Theme parks revenue is expected to rebound 76% to $6.3 billion.
Ehrlich pointed to Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), whose theme parks division had its most profitable fourth quarter in NBCUniversal’s history, as a sign that demand is returning. She predicts that Disney’s domestic attendance will be strong, with parks outside the U.S. lagging.
The film studio, though, remains impacted by COVID and the reluctance of some to return to movie theaters. The studio's releases -- which included the Disney animated film ""Encanto,"" Steven Spielberg's ""West Side Story"" and Marvel's ""Eternals"" -- brought in $2.1 billion at the U.S. and Canadian box office, according to Comscore. That's nearly 10 times the $224.5 million in ticket sales from the same period in 2020, when most movie theaters were closed, but shy of the $2.9 billion in box office proceeds from 2019.

“They had another tough quarter,” said Ehrlich. “COVID is coming and going. It has not been conducive really for theatrical attendance, except for something that really stands out, like ‘Spider-man.’”
Analysts estimate Disney will report first-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share on revenue of $20.91 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com – Carrier Global stock (NYSE:CARR) was up 2.5% Tuesday after the company beat both revenue and earnings estimates in the fourth quarter and cheered traders with an outlook for higher margins.
Adding to the gains was Carrier’s announcement of a $1.6 billion share repurchase plan for 2022. It has also allocated around $500 million for the dividend payout in the year.
Carrier’s fourth-quarter sales of $5.1 billion were up 12% while organic sales rose 11%, reflecting continued order momentum. New order bookings were the strongest in North America while business from China suffered.
Residential and transport segments showed strong growth for cooling solutions as economies reopened and corporates and individuals looked to upgrade. Supply chain issues weighed on its fire and security solutions business, with sales rising a low 3%.
The company is now projecting annual sales of about $20 billion with high single-digit organic sales growth. Adjusted operating margin is seen higher by around 75 basis points to reach 14.35% in the year. Adjusted profit per share for 2022 is seen broadly unchanged at $2.25.
The company completed the sale of its Chubb fire and security business to APi Group. It also struck a deal announced this weekend with Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) to buy out most of the Japanese company’s stake in an air-conditioner joint venture for about $868 million. The partnership firm had sales of $2.1 billion in 2021. The transaction is expected to close by end-September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats wrote to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive on Tuesday, raising ""significant concerns"" about the electric-car maker's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Beta) systems which have prompted scrutiny from government safety regulators.
""We are deeply troubled by Tesla’s design choices that seemingly encourage unsafe driving habits,"" senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey wrote, finding fault with Tesla's decision to allow vehicles using its Full-Self Driving (Beta) system to roll through stop signs at low speeds. 
Under pressure from regulators, Tesla last week agreed to recall about 54,000 U.S. vehicles to revise software to prevent vehicles from disregarding stop signs. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) last week ""there were no safety issues"" with the function.
Tesla did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
Tesla has been testing the improved version of its automated driving software on public roads, but the carmaker and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have said the features do not make the cars autonomous.
Tesla faces a number of other investigations.
""These complaints and investigations paint a troubling picture: Tesla repeatedly releases software without fully considering its risks and implications, creating grave dangers for all on the roads,” the senators said, asking Musk to answer a series of questions by Feb. 22 regarding its design and programming decisions.
In November, Tesla recalled https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalling-nearly-12000-us-vehicles-over-software-communication-error-2021-11-02 nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 for another software update because a communication error could cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes.
NHTSA said last week it was reviewing complaints from consumers that Tesla vehicles were activating the brakes unnecessarily.
NHTSA last month sought additional information from Tesla in its probe into 580,000 vehicles over the automaker’s decision to allow games https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-stop-games-infotainment-screens-moving-cars-ap-2021-12-23 to be played by passengers on the front center touch screen.

The notes will mature on March 1, 2028, and will be convertible at the holder's option to common stock or a combination of stock and cash. 
Snap said it intends to use the money raised for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. In addition, the company added that it may also use a portion of the proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies or to repurchase Snap’s securities.
Offerings of convertible notes can be viewed as a sign of a funding shortage, commonly seen in startups in their high-growth stage.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Thomson Reuters Corp missed fourth-quarter earnings forecasts on Tuesday as the news and data provider stepped up investments it said would help deliver stronger-than-expected revenue growth this year and next. 
The parent company of Reuters News reported adjusted earnings fell to 43 cents per share from 54 cents a year earlier. That was 3 cents below Wall Street expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.
Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold called it a ""mixed quarter,"" with better than expected revenue offset by weaker profits. The Toronto-based company is well placed to grow earnings given stable demand for its products, but the shares already reflect those positives, he said in a note to clients. 
The stock was down 3.5% in early New York and Toronto trading.
 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), which owns the Westlaw legal database and the Checkpoint tax and accounting service, said it invested $25 million in the quarter on additional sales and marketing resources, product development and data analytics.
Chief Executive Steve Hasker said the company was in a strong position to tap into trends emerging in the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Customers (are) increasingly realizing the value of our content and tools in a hybrid working world that’s affected by accelerating complexity,"" he said in an email to staff. 
Total revenues rose 6% in the quarter to $1.71 billion, ahead of analyst expectations, according to estimates from Refinitiv.
The company now sees revenue growth of around 5% this year, versus 4-5% previously, and expects to grow 5.5-6.0% in 2023, versus 5-6% before.
While information services stocks continue to show resilient growth, they have lagged the broader market in 2022 as investors have switched to companies with more scope for recovery in profits as the pandemic abates, Edward Jones' Arnold said.
Thomson Reuters' U.S.-listed shares are down about 16% this year versus a 4% drop for the S&P 500. The company's peers include RELX Group’s LexisNexis, Bloomberg LP, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s DowJones, and Wolters Kluwer NV.
BILLIONS TO SPEND
Thomson Reuters is mid-way through a two-year $600 million investment into a ""Change Program"" to transform itself from a holding company of different businesses to a more focused, content-driven technology company. 
""We'll continue to look at acquisitions to supplement our existing assets to help drive organic growth in 2022 and 2023,"" Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood told Reuters in an interview, adding the company potentially had ""billions"" available for deals.
CEO Hasker told analysts on a conference call: ""We don't need transformational acquisitions.""
The company raised its annual dividend by 10% to $1.78 per share. 
The three main divisions - Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals, and Corporates - reported quarterly sales up between 5% and 9%, but only the tax segment saw higher adjusted earnings before interest and other items (EBITDA).
The Reuters News division showed double-digit increases in both sales and adjusted EBITDA.
Thomson Reuters swung to a diluted loss per share of 36 cents in the quarter and posted a 73% drop in operating profit to $257 million, due to higher costs and a boost in the year earlier period from the sale of an investment.

The company also said it had to pay $80 million to UK tax authorities by March, but that it was disputing the demand. It gave no further details. 
Reuters News makes more than half its revenue from supplying news to Refinitiv, a data company spun off from Thomson Reuters and now owned by the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Thomson Reuters holds a minority stake in the LSE following the deal, worth about $7 billion as of Monday, the company said.

(Reuters) -CoverGirl parent Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc on Tuesday raised its profit expectations for the year, as the cosmetics major's focus on high-margin skincare products cushions the effect of higher costs from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.
Shares rose about 5% as investors looked past the hit to quarterly sales from COVID-19 curbs in some markets and cheered a rebound in demand for makeup in the United States from the reopening of offices and the return of social gatherings.
""We are selling more expensive products, more expensive categories, in regions of the world where there is high price elasticities. Think of China, think of skincare with Lancaster,"" Chief Executive Officer Sue Nabi said in an interview.
New launches, including the Flora Gorgeous Gardenia by Gucci and Burberry Hero, powered sales higher in the United States, the company said.
The company's raised full-year profit outlook follows a similar move by rival  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) Cos Inc last week on price hikes and customers venturing out more.
Coty raised its adjusted per-share profit forecast for the year to between 22 cents and 26 cents, from 20 cents to 24 cents earlier.

Investing.com -- General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) fell over 5% Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock over concerns about its concerns around the company's shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. 
Analyst Adam Jonas downgraded GM to Equal Weight from Overweight, also pointing to the company's lower than expected 2022 guidance coming in below his expectations.
Jonas said the fiscal 2022 guidance was well below their forecasts, triggering ""an estimate cut of 11% for FY22 and 16% for FY23. This marks the most significant estimate reduction we have made for GM since the start of COVID in early FY20.""
""While 4Q21 results were modestly better than expected, GM guided to Adj. EBIT and EPS for 2022 that was materially lower than our forecast due to cost creep and deteriorating mix,"" he added.
Furthermore, the analyst now expects ""GM to remain one holistic company"" for at least 12 to 18 months as management builds out its electric vehicle, autonomous vehicle and connected car capabilities.
From a note released last week, it is clear Jonas favors Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) over other EV manufacturers. The analyst said they expect Tesla revenues to be larger than General Motors and Ford combined by 2027. "

The company is forecasting total net revenue of $840 million at center of its guidance range, a rise of 8.2%. That will follow the 20% jump in 2021 annual revenue that crossed $776 million as the pandemic kept demand for online teaching elevated.

Chegg closed the year with 7.8 million subscribers, up 18%, and aims to add new subjects and incorporate more personalization in the learning method to build on that base and deliver on its forecast.
To cater to needs of students that go beyond academics, it launched Chegg Life and plans to focus on personal finance, soft-skills, mental health and wellness under that plan.

Shares of  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) rose as much as 5.2% in Sao Paulo Tuesday after climbing 4.9% in the previous session in the wake of Tyson’s better-than-expected first-quarter profit. Marfrig Global Foods (OTC:MRRTY), the owner of National Beef Packing Co, climbed as much as 5.1%, leading gains on the benchmark Ibovespa index at 12:55 p.m. local time.
Tyson, the largest U.S. meat company by sales, beat earnings estimates on Monday and said revenue will be at the upper end of a previous estimate for the current financial year as rising meat prices offset higher costs. The results led JPMorgan Chase & Co. to boost estimates for Brazilian meatpackers.
“There is a clear market read-across to JBS and Marfrig in the extent that consumer elasticity to higher meat prices remain supportive” of strong 2022 results, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Lucas Ferreira said Tuesday in a note. Even considering U.S. beef margins peaked in 2021, earnings momentum remains strong and valuations are cheap, Ferreira said.
Lower profits for the U.S. beef industry have been expected amid rising cattle prices, transportation and labor costs. Last week, Marfrig said U.S. beef margins are likely to fall from recent records to “normal levels” as higher costs will only be partially passed on to consumers. Still, JPMorgan's revised earnings forecasts for 2022 suggest there might be room for upside in consensus estimates.
“The outlook is still very optimistic” as U.S. beef demand remains strong, Marfrig investor relations Eduardo Puzziello said at an event.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The activist investment firm pushing for a sale of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc on Tuesday said plans to replace the fitness company's chief executive are not enough and that the board must still pursue strategic alternatives to benefit all shareholders.
Blackwells Capital, which owns a nearly 5% stake of Peloton, reacted to news that New York-based Peloton's founder, John Foley, was shifting positions to executive chairman and that a former Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology executive would replace him as chief executive.
The move ""does not address any of Peloton investors' concerns,"" Jason Aintabi, Blackwells' chief investment officer wrote in a statement, adding: ""Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or Executive Chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done"" on Tuesday.
Blackwells on Monday sent Peloton a 65-page presentation, saying the company known for its exercise equipment such as stationary bikes and its on-demand fitness classes has been ""grossly mismanaged.""
The presentation said potential buyers should be able to pay at least $65 while strategic buyers could easily pay $75 a share.
Blackwells said companies ranging from Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) could be potential strategic buyers of Peloton.
Blackwells accused Foley of managing with ""unbridled optimism rather than discipline"" and blamed him for bloated costs, poor decision making and poor capital allocation. The company's share price dropped 76% last year.
Peloton became a market darling during the COVID-19 pandemic as gyms were closed and its market capitalization surged to $50 billion before tumbling to $9.7 billion. The company's share price surged in the wake of reports that some companies, including Amazon, were discussing making an overture to the company.

While many investors had become frustrated with Peloton as the stock price fell, analysts also noted that the company might be difficult to target because it has two classes of stock, effectively allowing insiders to control it.
Blackwells has also issued a request to review the company's books and records to see whether the company's dual-class share structure may have contributed to a lack of oversight.

MILAN (Reuters) -Stellantis on Tuesday unveiled its new Alfa Romeo Tonale compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) as it aims to expand in the premium market and add electrified and interconnected vehicles to its range.
The new model, named after an Alpine pass in northern Italy, will compete in a segment populated by some of Europe's most popular premium cars such as BMW's X1, the Mercedes GLA and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Audi Q3.
The world's fourth largest carmaker plans to spend over 30 billion euros ($34.2 billion) through 2025 to electrify its vehicle lineup and boost its software content to catch up with rivals, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The Tonale includes built-in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa voice assistant features. Owners will be able to choose their car as a delivery spot, allowing couriers to unlock the doors safely and leave a parcel inside the vehicle.
""It marks a step in the direction of our group becoming a technology company,"" the brand's head Jean-Philippe Imparato said during a web presentation.
The new Tonale, to be built at Italy's Pomigliano plant near Naples, is Alfa Romeo's first electrified vehicle and is initially offered in mild hybrid as well as a diesel engine models. A plug-in hybrid version, with an all electric range of up to 80 kilometres, will arrive later this year.
Imparato did not provide details about when an all electric version could be released. Sales prices are expected to be announced before orders open in April. 
Some analysts say the Alfa Romeo brand could be part of Stellantis' strategy in China, the world's biggest auto market, where it has been lagging behind most competitors.
Imparato has promised a new model release for Alfa Romeo every year to 2026, starting with 2022's Tonale. This should include a smaller-sized SUV, expected to be built in Poland.
Starting from 2027, all Alfa Romeo new vehicles will be all electric, he has said. 

Stellantis was formed last year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, and is home to 14 brands, including bestseller Jeep, DS and Lancia in the premium segment and Maserati in the luxury end. 
The new Alfa Romeo Tonale is based on a former Fiat Chrysler architecture, while the first Stellantis models built on a new shared platform are expected from next year. ($1 = 0.8767 euros)

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP)'s profits hit their highest in eight years in 2021, lifted by soaring gas and oil prices, as the company boosted share repurchases and accelerated plans to cut emissions with increased spending on low carbon energy.
BP's rebound to an annual profit of $12.85 billion after a large loss in 2020, is likely to add to calls in Britain for higher taxes on energy producers to help reduce consumers' energy bills.
The results were supported by higher oil and gas prices and production, partly offset by weaker oil trading results and the impact of higher energy costs on operations such as refining, the company said. 
Natural gas and electricity prices around the world have soared since the middle of last year because of tight gas supplies and higher demand as economies rebounded from pandemic shutdowns. 
BP said it would plough more cash into its low-carbon and renewables business while reducing oil output in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by mid-century.
But as companies like BP reduce spending on new fossil fuel projects, consumers should expect more volatile oil and gas prices, Chief Executive Bernard Looney said.
""We can expect more volatility in the coming months and years,"" Looney told Reuters. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, BP's underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net earnings, reached $4.1 billion, beating analysts' forecast of $3.93 billion. 
That was BP's largest quarterly profit since early 2013.
BP shares were up 0.3% at 1446 GMT, compared with a 0.1% decline in the broader European energy index.
For the year, BP's $12.85 billion profit compared with a loss of $5.7 billion in 2020, when it wrote off $6.5 billion from the value of its oil and gas assets following a slump in energy demand.
BP's debt fell to $30.6 billion by the end of last year, down $8.3 billion from a year earlier.
The company maintained its dividend at 5.46 cents per share and boosted its share repurchase targets to $1.5 billion per quarter from $1.25 billion.
Capital spending will grow in 2022 to a range of $14 billion to $15 billion, up from $12.8 billion in 2021. 
Last week, Shell (LON:RDSa) boosted its share buybacks and dividend after fourth-quarter profits hit their highest in eight years, helped by a strong gas trading performance.
LOW-CARBON SPENDING
Looney laid out plans in 2020 to cut BP's carbon emissions in the coming decades by increasing its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reducing its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day.
While maintaining its plan to spend $14-$16 billion per year until 2025, in its strategy update on Tuesday BP said it would increase spending on low carbon energy, which includes retail and electric vehicle charging, to 40% of total spending by 2025 and 50% by 2030.
These businesses are expected to generate earnings of $9-$10 billion by 2030, BP said, seeking to assuage investor concerns over the returns of low carbon businesses in the long term.
""We're not investing for growth"" in oil and gas production, Looney told analysts, even as BP expects fossil fuels to deliver $33 billion in annual earnings until 2025.
BP also accelerated its carbon emissions reduction plans, now aiming to cut to net zero all greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, production and sales by 2050, catching up with rivals including Shell and Norway's Equinor.

The new decarbonisation targets double the carbon emissions BP will need to cut or offset to 2 billion tonnes, Looney said.
Tobias Wagner, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said that while the results were strong and the company provided more details on its strategy ""the transition will also take time and carries execution risks, with hydrocarbon operations to continue to remain the largest profit contributor for some time.""

636,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 10:17AM ET</span>","SoftBank dumps sale of Arm over regulatory hurdles, to IPO instead","By Jane Lanhee Lee and Josh Horwitz
SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp has shelved its blockbuster sale of Arm Ltd to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp valued at up to $80 billion citing regulatory hurdles and will instead seek to list the company.
Britain's Arm, which named a new CEO on Tuesday, said it would go public before March 2023 and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son indicated that would be in the United States, most likely the Nasdaq.
SoftBank acquired Arm, whose technology powers Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone and nearly all other smartphones, in 2016 for $32 billion.
The collapse of its sale marks a major setback for the Japanese conglomerate's efforts to generate funds at time when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure.
Many SoftBank portfolio companies are trading below their listing price, with office-sharing firm WeWork, ride hailer Grab and used-car platform Auto1 all down last quarter.
""It (Arm) had the rare hallmarks of a SoftBank investment turning to gold, but instead Arm will head back for listing in financial markets where tech stocks have been seriously tarnished of late,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said, adding, ""such a bumper valuation is likely to be far from reach.""
The cash-and-stock deal with Nvidia was announced in 2020, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December, arguing that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt.
The buyout also faced scrutiny in Britain and the European Union and had yet to receive approval in China, which has previously withheld approval of cross-border chip acquisitions.
The value of the sale, which depended on Nvidia's stock price, was originally pegged at about $40 billion but rose with Nvidia's stock price to about $80 billion late last year, though the California company's stock has fallen since.
The inability to acquire Arm is a missed opportunity for Nvidia, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that the collapse of the deal removes an overhang on the stock and investors can now ""focus on the company's attractive fundamentals"".
Nvidia's shares fell 1.9% in trading before the bell.
On a company earnings call on Tuesday, SoftBank CEO Son, who had said the company initially considered listing Arm but opted to sell it instead due to the pandemic, sought to put a positive spin on the scrapped sale. 
He said Arm would power revolutions in areas such as cloud computing and the metaverse and that it would be the most significant IPO the chip industry has ever seen.
SoftBank said it would recognise a $1.25 billion breakup fee that Nvidia had deposited as profit in the fourth quarter. 
NEW CEO
Arm in a separate statement that it had appointed Rene Haas to replace Simon Segars as chief executive officer and member of the board, effective immediately. An industry veteran, Haas joined Arm in 2013 and previously worked for seven years at Nvidia.
""We are excited about the opportunity to be a publicly listed company again,"" Haas said in an interview with Reuters.
SoftBank said Arm's net sales surged 40% to $2 billion in the nine months to December. 
An Arm acquisition would have put Nvidia into even more intense competition with rivals in the data center chip market such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc .
Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Apple and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd that design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers.
Nvidia has become the most valuable U.S. chip company on the strength of its graphic processor chips. Although still seen as crucial for gaming, graphic processors have become much more widely used for artificial intelligence and other advanced fields.
Nvidia said in a statement that it would retain its 20-year Arm license.
The collapse of the deal underscores again the difficulty that companies face in convincing antitrust regulators and governments to approve large tech deals, especially in the semiconductor industry.

Last week, a $5 billion deal between Taiwan GlobalWafers and German chip supplier Siltronic fell apart after German regulators failed to approve it on time.
In 2018, Qualcomm walked away from a $44 billion deal to buy  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval, and former U.S. President Donald Trump blocked microchip maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s proposed takeover of Qualcomm.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – DuPont stock (NYSE:DD) traded 5.2% higher Tuesday as the maker of industrial materials rode price hikes and strong demand in its electronics unit to leave fourth-quarter estimates behind.
Compounding the gains were the company’s decision to boost its quarterly dividend by 10% and the board’s approval for a $1 billion share buyback program.
Net sales rose 14% to $4.3 billion on growth across all its operating regions and solid organic growth in its business segments.
Sales in electronics and industrial jumped 19%. The July 2021 acquisition of Laird Performance Materials added to sales. Organic volumes were higher too, driven by a shift to high-performance computing and 5G communications. DuPont makes advanced electronic materials for smart and autonomous vehicles and 5G wireless services.
Sales at the water and protection segment, which provides treatment and purification technologies, grew by 16%. Demand for its water technologies, primarily in industrial and desalination markets, was strong. Mobility and materials grew 12%, thanks to higher prices. However, volumes fell, reflecting the softness in global auto production.
The company expects 2022 net sales to be $17.6 billion at midpoint of its guidance range, up 5.3%. However, in the current quarter, the raw material and logistics cost inflation are likely to weigh on performance, according to the company. Net sales in the quarter are seen at around $4.25 billion.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday raised its full-year profit outlook as it squeezed out more profit per vehicle but said that access to scarce semiconductors would be the key driver of future earnings growth. 
Like other big global carmakers, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) has been forced to cut vehicle output, even amid robust demand in key markets such as China and the United States because of a chip shortage caused by COVID supply chain disruptions and competition for the component from a range of industries. 
""2022 will be driven by how many cars we can make, rather than how many we can sell,"" Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta said at a briefing following its latest earnings announcement.
Some car makers say they expect chip shortages to ease in the second half of 2022, although some automotive chipmakers have cautioned that a recovery could take longer https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/automakers-chip-firms-differ-when-semiconductor-shortage-will-abate-2022-02-04. 
The company raised its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 by 17% to 210 billion yen ($1.82 billion) helped by cost cutting that improved margins and a weaker yen that bolstered the yen value of overseas sales. 
That outlook is higher than a mean 194 billion yen profit based on estimates from 20 analysts, Refinitiv data shows. 
The scarcity of cars for consumers to buy also means that Japan's No. 3 carmaker has been earning more per car because it no longer needs to offer large financial incentives to lure consumers, particularly in the U.S. 
Japan's No. 3 carmaker, maintained its global full-year sales target of 3.8 million vehicles after cutting it from 4.4 million in November. 
""I am hoping we can get more semiconductors,"" Nissan Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ma said at the briefing. 
Operating profit for the three months to Dec. 31 almost doubled to 52.2 billion yen ($451.8 million), exceeding an average 35.8 billion yen profit estimated by nine analysts, Refinitiv data shows.

Retail volume in the quarter shrank by 16.3% from a year ago to 904,000 vehicles, with the biggest drop in the United States, which fell 19.8%.

Investing.com — Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR) stock jumped over 27% Tuesday on the news an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary has acquired a warrant to buy 39.6 million shares in the Silicon Valley-based sensor technology company. 
After hours on Monday, following the announcement, Velodyne's shares rose 127% before giving up the majority of those gains. Velodyne shares have had a difficult 12 months, falling 84% on management difficulties, including the resignation of its CEO and a lawsuit from former executives regarding its 2020 SPAC merger.
The warrant, issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon, may be exercised at any time before February 4, 2030, at an exercise price of $4.18 per share. 
Velodyne said in its press release that the warrant shares will be vested over time based on discretionary payments to Velodyne by Amazon of up to $200 million. 
While the deal has provided a short-term bounce in Velodyne's share price, what it actually means going forward is another matter. As pointed out by BofA analyst John Murphy, Amazon frequently makes minority investments in companies via warrants. Furthermore, there is a lack of detail in the announcement, and so it may be too early to come to any solid conclusions about the future of Velodyne. "

Vancouver-based D-Wave is pushing ahead with the deal even as other companies that recently took a similar route, such as Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, have seen their market valuations tumble amid choppy conditions.
D-Wave said it expects to raise up to $340 million in gross proceeds from the deal, including a $40 million private placement in public equity from PSP Investments, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, NEC Corporation, Yorkville Advisors and Aegis Group Partners.
The company plans to use the proceeds to grow its global footprint to emerging markets and build on its 200-plus patents.
Shares of DPCM Capital were up 0.7% at $9.87 before the bell.
Founded in 1999, D-Wave provides real-time, full-stack quantum systems that power hardware engineering, post-processing software and chip fabrication. They find use in sectors ranging from logistics and artificial intelligence to financial modelling and cybersecurity. 
Auto major Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), software firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and defense systems maker  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) are among D-Wave's blue-chip customers.

Upon closing the deal, the combined company will be known as D-Wave Quantum Inc and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""QBTS"".
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is serving as the financial advisor to D-Wave, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is serving as the capital markets advisor to DPCM.

The company had announced https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/coty-files-ipo-brazilian-unit-help-deleverage-2021-08-26 plans to publicly list the unit in August, aiming to use the proceeds to pay down debt and expand its business.
""In light of the current economic volatility and adverse financial market conditions in Brazil, we have decided to withdraw from the IPO registration application process for the time being,"" said Laurent Mercier, Coty's chief financial officer, on a call with analysts.
Mercier said the company would monitor market conditions to potentially pursue an IPO at a later date.

The Brazilian economy, weakened by high inflation and unemployment, is in danger of sinking deeper into recession this year ahead of October's presidential election, as anxiety over the vote and steep interest rate rises continue to hurt growth, a Reuters poll showed in January.
Separately, Coty raised its profit expectations for the year, benefiting from its focus on high-margin skincare products.

The company also boosted its quarterly dividend by 10% and announced a new $1 billion share buyback program, as it capitalizes on a rebound in the auto and chipmaking industries as well as the rollout of high-end telecom technologies.
DuPont, which makes advanced electronic materials for smart and autonomous vehicles and 5G wireless services, said organic sales in its Electronics & Industrial segment grew by 9%, boosted by strong volumes in the Semiconductor Technologies division.
The company said sales in its Water & Protection segment, which provides treatment and purification technologies, grew by 16% in the quarter.
""Sustained strong demand in key end-markets such as electronics and water ... (was) critical to our fourth-quarter results,"" Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen said in a statement.
To hedge inflationary pressure roiling several industries, DuPont hiked the price of its products by 7% in the quarter. 
The company expects 2022 net sales between $17.4 billion and $17.8 billion, higher than analyst estimates, on the back of strong consumer demand.
But Chief Financial Officer Lori Koch said high costs for raw materials and logistics would continue to impact margins, prompting DuPont to forecast roughly flat growth in first-quarter core earnings from the prior three-month period.

It expects full-year adjusted earnings to be $4.60 to $4.90 per share, the midpoint of which falls below the consensus estimate of $4.86 per share.
Total sales for the fourth quarter jumped 14% to $4.3 billion and beat analysts' average estimate of $4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted net income of $1.08 per share also topped expectations of 98 cents per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bid by budget carriers Frontier Group Holdings and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline will face close scrutiny from the Justice Department, lawyers said Monday.
The Biden administration has made injecting more competition into U.S. industries a key priority.
Andre Barlow, an antitrust lawyer at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard LLC, said in the ""antitrust environment"" the airlines would have trouble getting the deal past the department's Antitrust Division.
""Given the administration's stance against mergers, it will be difficult for these two low-budget competitors to convince the antitrust enforcers that its merger will lead to lower prices,"" he said.
Frontier and Spirit pledged to avoid any job losses and add 10,000 direct jobs by 2026. They also promised the merger would deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings.
""DOJ will focus on whether the two airlines overlap with respect to city pairs and whether the combination of two budget airlines would result in higher prices for consumers,"" Barlow said.
Kenneth Quinn, a partner at Clyde & Co, said however that the DoJ would have a ""hard time blocking this merger.""
""You've got two ultra-low-cost carriers with a common fleet without a lot of competitive city pair overlap,"" he said.
The Justice Department sued in September to unwind American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) ""Northeast Alliance"" partnership, arguing it seeks to eliminate ""significant competition between a dominant airline and a uniquely disruptive competitor.""
The Justice Department declined to comment on the merger proposal. A White House spokesperson did not comment on the Frontier Spirit merger proposal but said the Biden administration ""is committed to protecting competition across a wide range of industries for the benefit of consumers.""
In September, the administration said it planned to award 16 slots for flights at Newark International Airport in New Jersey to a yet-to-be-determined low-cost carrier.
The slots were previously owned by United Airlines and then transferred to Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) before being given up. United advocated for them to be retired to reduce congestion.
Last month, the Transportation Department issued a new rule to make it easier for regulators to move faster to protect airline customers from unfair and deceptive practices. It plans future rules on airline ticket refunds and transparency of airline baggage and other fees.

American and three other airlines control over 80% of the U.S. domestic air market.
Tim Wu, a White House adviser https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/05/white-house-announces-additional-policy-staff on technology and competition policy, in 2018 argued https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/opinion/sprint-t-mobile-merger.html consolidation resulted in the largest U.S. airlines ""finding ways to give less for more: fewer flights (more crowded planes), smaller seats, fewer flight attendants, higher baggage and change fees and a stubborn resistance to lowering fares.""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Harley-Davidson stock (NYSE:HOG) rose 7% in premarket trading Tuesday after strong demand in North America and higher prices for its iconic motorcycles helped it deliver a surprise profit.
Adjusted profit per share came in at 15 cents when a loss of 34 cents was expected.
Under Jochen Zeitz, who took over as CEO two years ago, Harley-Davidson has cut costs and focused on selling higher-priced products to its loyal customers in the developed markets of U.S. and Europe.
Motorcycle sales rose 39% in volumes in the fourth quarter. Unit sales in North America were higher by 8% though other markets struggled, a natural outcome of the company’s move to exit unprofitable product segments and countries. Extended shipping times in international markets also hurt. Higher supply chain costs and tariffs in Europe eroded fourth-quarter gross margins by 2 percentage points.
Total revenue rose 40% to $1 billion, more than half coming from motorcycles.
The company is expecting revenue from motorcycles and related products to grow 5%-10% this year, assuming supply chains improve.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms should not allow users to share people's private residential information on its platforms even when the information is publicly available, the company's oversight board said in its first policy advisory opinion.
The board also recommended Meta create a communications channel so that so-called doxxing victims can better explain their cases to the company.
Doxxing is the public release of sensitive information identifying an individual or organization, like a home address or phone number. It can lead to harassment or stalking. 
Celebrities and private individuals have been affected by sharing of such information, which raises issues around privacy, public interest and civic activism. In a recent high-profile case, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling accused trans activists of doxxing her by posting a photo of her home on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Meta's independent oversight board, which includes academics, rights experts and lawyers, was created by the company to rule on a small slice of thorny content moderation appeals but it can also advise on site policies.
Last year, Meta requested a policy advisory opinion from the board on when private residential addresses and images may be published on Facebook and Instagram. 
The company's current rules say users should not share ""personally identifiable information about yourself or others"" but Meta may allow content like a person's address to be posted if it is considered ""publicly available.""
Meta's internal guidance to content reviewers said information published by at least five news outlets or available through various public records did not count as private, the board said. 
The board said Meta should remove this exemption and should ensure exceptions for newsworthy content should be consistently applied. It also said Meta should allow external images of private residences when the property is the focus of the news story, though not for organizing protests against the resident.
It was the first time Meta's oversight board had responded to a request for a policy advisory opinion not related to a specific case. The company has 60 days to publicly respond.

The oversight board, which has ruled on cases such as the suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has so far overturned Meta's content decisions in 17 of 22 cases.
Twitter recently expanded its own privacy rules to ban the sharing of images and videos of private individuals without people's consent, but soon acknowledged the new policy was being abused by malicious actors and that the company's enforcement team had made mistakes.

LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union agreed on Tuesday to prolong until June 30, 2025 permission for Britain's clearing houses to continue serving customers in the bloc, with officials saying it would be the final extension.
Clearing has become a Brexit battle ground between Britain and the EU as the bloc seeks control over euro-denominated trades to build ""strategic autonomy"" in capital markets.
The London Stock Exchange's LCH unit in London clears about 90% of euro interest rate derivatives, a contract widely used by companies in the EU to insure themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
Mairead McGuinness, financial services chief at the executive European Commission, said she will also propose measures to reduce ""our excessive dependence"" on major clearers based outside the bloc and to improve the attractiveness of EU-based clearers while enhancing their supervision as volumes increase.
The EU was forced to extend clearing permission for LCH and two other clearers in London, ICE (NYSE:ICE) and LME Clear, after failing to persuade banks and their customers to shift the activity from London to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex in Frankfurt fast enough.
An abrupt end to cross-border clearing would have disrupted markets, but EU officials believe three years will be long enough to shift enough business without needing a further extension.
""It's clearly the end of the road, there will be no extension after those three years,"" an EU official said.
Eurex said on Tuesday that average daily cleared volumes in interest rate swaps grew to a record 276 billion euros ($314.75 billion) in January, a market share of 22%.
""In the long run, euro clearing has to take place in Europe,"" said Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, adding London has benefited from EU inaction.
REDUCTION TARGETS
The EU's 46-page consultation paper https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/2022-central-clearing-review-consultation-document_en.pdf is asking for views on possible ""negative and positive"" incentives, such as forcing EU market participants to open and use a clearing account with the clearer in the bloc, and imposing targets on customers to cut their use of specific UK clearers.
Incentives could include hiking capital charges on EU banks exposures to UK clearers to encourage a shift in clearing across the Channel, along with forcing more private and public entities like asset managers and pension funds in the EU to clear their trades, an EU official said.
The range of products that must be cleared could also be broadened.
EU customers account for a minority of the London Stock Exchange's euro clearing business, and the bourse said it was focused on ensuring orderly functioning of markets. ICE had no immediate comment.
The four-week consultation period will be followed by a ""communication"" setting out the way forward, with a legislative proposal in the third quarter.
Data would be collected from market participants to monitor how their exposure to UK clearers is cut over time, but EU officials declined to say how much clearing would need to move to satisfy the bloc's authorities.
Banks have warned they could shift clearing from London to the United States, where clearing houses already have long-term access to EU customers.

Eurex focuses on euro-denominated clearing but banks say they want to stick with LCH in London because it offers clearing across several currencies to cut the amount of capital and collateral needed.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The chip industry is breathing a sigh of relief over the aborted purchase of ARM Ltd by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp but the firms and their shareholders are left with challenges the deal would have addressed.
Announced in 2020, Nvidia's plan to buy Britain's Arm from Japan's SoftBank was seen worth up to $80 billion and sparked an immediate backlash.
There were concerns that the deal might violate Arm's status as a neutral player in the hyper-competitive chip sector.
Many analysts warned the deal was ""doomed from the start"", due to anti-competitive regulatory concerns and geopolitical tensions. 
This prediction played out on Tuesday as SoftBank shelved the sale citing those very regulatory hurdles, with the transaction drawing scrutiny in the United States, Britain and European Union.
""The whole point about Arm was always that it was the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, dealing very even-handedly with all of its 500-plus licensees. That wasn't lost on the regulators in the UK, the U.S., EU and China,"" Hermann Hauser, a founder of Arm, told Reuters.
""There's a chip war going on around the world, so many weren't very welcoming of such a key architecture firm going to the U.S.,"" said Greg Roh, head of research at Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Securities.
""Countries are competitively trying to build up their chip industries, and will try to defend against their chip technology moving to another country,"" he said. 
Due to their low energy consumption, Arm-based chips were perfectly suited for mobile devices, and the company's technology underpinned the smartphone wave, licensing more and more powerful processor designs to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its rivals.
The merger would have boosted both companies' ambitions to crack the booming data centre sector, which is currently dominated by  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and its x86 architecture.
In April, Nvidia announced plans to release a specialised central processing unit (CPU) chip for data centres called ""Grace,"" based on Arm's architecture. That was viewed at the time as a harbinger of the charge the firms would make together into the sector.
Arm makes instruction set architecture (ISA) which it licenses to a wide range of companies, which use it to make blueprints for chip designs. 
Arm dominates the market for smartphone application processors, with customers including Apple and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
Nvidia, meanwhile, makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for high-performance computing applications and gaming.
Stacy Rasgon, who tracks the chip sector Bernstein Research, says that Nvidia is not solely reliant on Arm to fulfil its data centre ambitions.
But he said it would be harder for Nvidia to build out a software ecosystem around those chips on its own, ""so buying ARM would be helpful for that"".
DOWNSIDES TO IPO
With the sale collapsed, Arm said it now aims to go public in 2023 having gone private in 2016 when SoftBank purchased it.
In an interview with Reuters, newly appointed Arm CEO Rene Haas said he is ""excited about the opportunity to be a publicly listed company again.""
But the company itself, together with Nvidia, had as recently as December tried to persuade British regulators that a deal with Nvidia was more favourable than an IPO.
They said going public would steer Arm to focus on short-term profits at the expense of its much needed foray into the server sector, especially as growth in the smartphone industry has slowed.
""While Arm’s licensees such as Apple, Qualcomm, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have enjoyed skyrocketing revenue growth and profits, as well as soaring market valuations, Arm has lately endured comparably flat revenues, rising costs, and lower profits that would likely present challenges for a 30-year old public company,"" they said in a jointly-issued letter https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61d81a458fa8f505953f4ed7/NVIDIA-Arm_-_CMA_Initial_Submission_-_NCV_for_publication__Revised_23_December_2021_.pdf. 

Still, there may be a silver lining, said Stewart Randall, who tracks the sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink. He said that while a listed company is beholden to its shareholders, it potentially is also under greater pressure to be innovative and competitive.
""Revenues have grown pretty slowly under SoftBank. I hope this lights a fire under them,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ride-sharing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) plans to begin reminding passengers to wear seat belts by pinging driver phones and sending riders messages amid a spike in U.S. traffic deaths.
Uber told Reuters its new feature that launches Tuesday aims to alert riders to buckle up via a distinctive chime from the driver’s phone and a simultaneous push notification to the rider’s phone.
""The intent is really just to help remind riders that they should be buckling up - every seat, every time,"" said Kristin Smith, Uber’s head of Global Road Safety Policy, who added the chime ""sounds kind of like an airplane seat belt reminder."" 
Uber wants riders to get in the habit of always buckling up. It plans to send riders push notifications at the start of their next five trips and then periodically thereafter.
Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety (NHTSA) estimated that U.S. traffic deaths climbed 12% through the first nine months of 2021 to 31,720 - the highest number killed on American roads in that period since 2006.
NHTSA estimates 90.4% of adult front-seat passengers wore seat belts in 2021, but studies have suggested back-seat passengers wear seat belts at lower rates.
The agency said previously of 22,215 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47% were not wearing seat belts.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found previously about 80% of people surveyed do not always buckle up during short trips or when traveling by taxi or ride-hailing service.
Mark Chung, vice president of roadway practice at the National Safety Council, noted that since 1975 seat belts are estimated to have saved more than 374,000 lives on U.S. roads. He praised Uber for ""taking seat belt safety seriously with this new feature.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will ease funding rules for innovative semiconductor plants under plans announced on Tuesday as the European Union looks to boost its chip industry and cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.
The Commission's action comes as a global chip shortage and supply chain bottlenecks have created havoc for car makers, healthcare providers, telecoms operators and others.
The European Chips Act will ""enable 15 billion euros ($17 billion) in additional public and private investment by 2030,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.
""This will come on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets. And these funds are set to be matched by further long-term private investments,"" she said, referring to ongoing EU projects.
The EU move mirrors the $52 billion U.S. Chips Act aimed at increasing competitiveness with China. 
Von der Leyen said the bloc will ease its state aid rules, which aim to prevent illegal and unfair subsidies granted by EU countries to companies, for innovative chip factories.
""We are, therefore, adapting our state aid rules, under strict conditions. This will allow - for the first time – public support for European 'first-of-a-kind' production facilities, which benefit all of Europe.""
These factories may be allowed to get more state funding, EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager said, as the bloc seeks to double its global market share to 20% in 2030.
""Such facilities, they would not exist in Europe if we do not do something. It may be justified to cover up to 100% of the proven funding gap with public resources,"" she told a news conference.
Vestager, asked if the Commission was bending state aid rules, said funding approval would be based on a rarely used provision in the EU treaty and that aid had to be proportionate, have a pan-European impact and not be more than was necessary.
She also warned EU governments against unfair tactics to attract investments.
""Because we cannot just authorise any subsidy where one is higher than the other. We have always been sort of very attentive to the fact that it should not be for one government to try to lure investments in one territory by jacking up the state aid promises,"" she said.
Smaller EU countries have voiced their unease over the looser rules, fearing a subsidy race that will favour companies in the bigger countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, an EU diplomat said.
The chip push comes as EU countries woo U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has yet to announce where it will locate a European mega-fab plant, triggering concerns of a subsidy race.
Intel welcomed the EU chip push, urging authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to join forces.
""We are currently considering a significant increase in our European footprint, and we expect that the EU Chips Act will facilitate these plans,"" the company said in a statement.
Britain's Arm Ltd, which named a new CEO on Tuesday, said it would go public before March 2023 and Masayoshi Son, boss of parent firm SoftBank, indicated that would be in the United States, most likely the Nasdaq.
The IPO plans comes as SoftBank dropped plans to sell Arm to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, setting aside a deal potentially worth up to $80 billion due to regulatory hurdles.
GlobalWafers is also looking for a new greenfield site as part of a $3.6 billion expansion plan put in place after its failed takeover of Germany's Siltronic.

The European Chips Act, which will require approval from EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law, also includes a toolbox allowing the Commission to demand companies deliver key chips during a crisis.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) fell 3.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, revealing struggles in its non-Covid business.
Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenue fell 2% on the year.
Sales of its pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar fell 27% in the U.S. as schedule of government purchases changed while Covid vaccinations were prioritized.
Shipments of its anti-smoking tablets Chantix remained suspended and weighed on the results. Tests had shown an unacceptably high level of a carcinogen in the medication. Sales of cancer drug Sutent were lower due to entry of competition on loss of exclusivity.
Fourth-quarter revenue more than doubled to nearly $24 billion as sales of its Covid vaccines exceeded expectations. Pfizer blamed the shortfall in revenue, excluding Covid treatments, to fewer selling days during the period compared to last year.
Comirnaty contributed $12.5 billion in direct sales and alliance revenue during the quarter. Germany’s BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) is Pfizer’s partner in marketing the Covid vaccines and they split the profits from it equally.
The company’s record-high forecast of $100 billion in 2022 revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range failed to cover the disappointment of its fourth-quarter numbers. The annual outlook includes revenue of around $32 billion from Comirnaty and $22 billion from Paxlovid.
Pfizer aims to make more than 4 billion doses of the shot in 2022. That compares with last year's 3 billion doses. Pfizer forecast 2022 sales of $98 billion to $102 billion, also below estimates of $105.48 billion.

The buy signal is triggered when the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rises by more than 50% of its 1-month moving average, which it last did Jan. 25, according to the strategists led by Mislav Matejka. The indicator has proven 100% accurate outside of recessions over the last three decades.
“We believe that equities still offer upside, and that the cycle is far from over,” the London-based strategists wrote in a Feb. 7 note. In addition to the VIX signal they look for more gains in earnings, a bottoming in Chinese activity and say investor sentiment has become too negative of late.
Data show the VIX signal has been triggered 21 times since 1990, with the S&P 500 Index gaining an average 9% in the six months afterwards. Prior to January, the last time the indicator flashed was in November, since when stocks have fallen globally. Markets have remained choppy this week.
The only time a false signal was produced was during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis as the S&P Index was still down 33% six months later.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 07:31AM ET</span>","U.S. adds Chinese entities to red-flag export list, WuXi Bio shares plunge","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it had added 33 Chinese entities to its so-called 'unverified list', which requires U.S. exporters to go through more procedures before shipping goods to the entities. 
The department said it was taking the step as it was unable to verify the legitimacy and reliability of those entities in relation to their use of U.S. exports. The entities included listed companies, universities as well as aerospace and electronics suppliers.
China's commerce ministry hit out at the U.S. decision, saying on Tuesday Washington should correct its ""wrongdoings"" and the United States should return to the track of cooperation and contribute more to the global economic recovery.
Stock in WuXi Biologics, whose units in Wuxi and Shanghai were added to the unverified list, plummeted more than 25% on Tuesday to wipe HK$77 billion ($9.9 billion) off its market value. Trade in shares of the company, which makes ingredients for vaccines including AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, was later halted.
WuXi Bio said that while it had imported manufacturing equipment subject to U.S. export controls, Washington's move would have no impact on its business or ongoing services to global partners. 
CEO Chris Chen told an investor call on Tuesday that WuXi Bio was prevented by U.S. export controls from reselling or re-exporting items purchased from the United States but that the Commerce Department had been unable to conduct checks that WuXi Bio was in compliance due to the pandemic. 
""Because of COVID-19, they have not been able to travel here in the last two years to verify us, so they have put us on this 'unverified list',"" he said. 
""The affected companies are only in Shanghai and Wuxi and our factories in Shanghai and Wuxi have already been built, so there is no longer any need to buy large amounts of hardware for bioreactors.""
The company's lawyers plan to negotiate with the U.S. Commerce Department, he added.
Shares in Hymson, a manufacturer of laser and automation equipment, slid more than 7% after a unit was added to the list.

Hymson said in a statement that the addition would not have any significant or adverse effect on its operations or financial situation. It added that it would evaluate what impact the listing could have on the company's future development.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>",U.S. banks outlook positive with loan growth and rate hikes in view,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - While U.S. bank stocks had a rocky start to the year, investors and analysts see accelerating loan growth and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes boosting the sector.
The U.S. economic recovery has spurred consumer spending, which is encouraging companies to build inventories and in turn has increased demand for business loans. 
And while net interest income, the difference between the rates banks charge for loans and what they pay out for deposits, weakened during the pandemic, this is expected to change in 2022 with interest rate increases, which the Fed is aiming to use to help tame runaway inflation.
After rallying in 2021 and early 2022, the S&P 500 bank index tumbled 15% from its record high last month as rising expenses and weak trading revenue at firms including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) sent investors fleeing.
Since bank lending profits depend on a steepening yield curve, recent flattening of the curve has added to investor worries, with the difference between U.S. 2-year Treasury yields and 10-year yields hitting it narrowest level since November 2020. 
As inflation has surged, traders have been betting on an increasing number of rate hikes in 2021. 
While higher rates favor banks, their share price declines reflect worries the Fed may ""hit the brakes a lot harder"" than originally expected and end up hurting the economy, according to Mike Cronin, investment director at asset manager abrdn in Boston. But he is bullish on banks.
""Expenses were an issue in the fourth quarter but we've set the bar on that,"" Cronin said. ""Now it's a bit more about the economy and rates. If we continue to see modest economic growth and accelerating loan growth going forward that bodes well for the sector in 2022."" 
Compared with March 2020, when they traded at 6.8 times earnings expectations for the next 12 months, bank stocks have recovered dramatically. But the S&P bank index's current price/earnings ratio of 12.9 still lags the S&P's 19.5 multiple.
With the KBW regional bank index currently trading at around 70% of the S&P 500's multiple compared with its more typical 90% level, the sector looks cheap to KBW's director of research, Matthew Kelley. 
""The fundamentals of the banks are actually strengthening,"" said Kelley, citing loan growth and rising rates. While higher expenses have hurt profits, he sees ""more than enough positive things happening with the banks on the top line to offset this.""
Kelley says recent selling in bank stocks has been exacerbated by a flattening yield curve, which was the result of fears about the economy that he expects will prove transitory.
As if on cue, bank stocks rose more than 2% on Friday, their biggest one-day gain since Jan. 6, after a stronger than expected jobs report provided some reassurance about the economy.
Wall Street analysts expect declines in quarterly earnings per share at the biggest U.S. banks in 2022, according to Refinitiv. After setting aside extra loan loss reserves in 2020, banks were able to release unused reserves last year, which artificially inflated earnings last year, making a tough comparison between 2021 and 2022 earnings. 

While investors have been betting on Fed rate hikes for some time, analysts say bank stocks do not fully reflect these expectations. KBW's Kelley notes that in the 2016-2018 Fed tightening cycle bank stocks did not peak until 21 months after the policy maker started raising rates. 
""Conceptually it's priced in but quantitatively there's potential for more upside,"" Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte said.

659,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 06:54AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Marginally Lower; Narrow Ranges Ahead of Key Inflation Data,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, struggling for significant direction with investors looking towards this week’s key inflation data for a lead.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract traded flat, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 30 points, or 0.2%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday just one point higher, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%, with the major indices trading in relatively narrow ranges, especially compared with last week’s dramatic moves.
This muted trading is expected to continue Tuesday, with investors firmly focused on Thursday’s consumer prices report for January and what this will potentially mean for Federal Reserve monetary policy going forward.
“Data are expected to show inflationary pressures in the U.S. continuing to heat up at the start of the year, likely putting a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase next month on autopilot,” said analysts at Fullerton Markets, in a note.
Economists expect the CPI to rise by 0.5% on the month and 7.3% year over year, a four-decade high, with core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) also rising 0.5% and 5.9% on the month and year, respectively.
Elsewhere, earnings season continues with industrial materials maker DuPont (NYSE:DD) beating fourth-quarter profit expectations and increasing its quarterly dividend by 10%.
Numbers are also out from drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), and they will be joined later by ride-hailing firm  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), Tex-Mex restaurant operator Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and food distributor Sysco (NYSE:SYY).
Elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal reported that Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) plans to replace its chief executive officer John Foley with Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as the exercise bike maker and former pandemic favorite looks to cope with waning demand.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) will also be in focus after long-time backer Peter Thiel resigned from its board, while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has canceled its planned purchase of chip designer ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY).
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, continuing to drop after closing lower for the first time in seven sessions as the market focused on the resumption of nuclear talks between the West and Iran in Vienna, which could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales.
Such an outcome could potentially increase global supply by over one million barrels per day, equal to over 1% of global supply.
Investors will also look for U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, while talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron appear to have calmed tensions over the future of Ukraine. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures fell 1.7% to $89.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.9% to $90.96.   
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,818.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1426.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Meta Platforms stock (NASDAQ:FB) traded 1.7% lower in premarket Tuesday as the company prepared for the exit of one of its early backers, billionaire investor Peter Thiel.
Thiel, on the company's board since 2005, has decided to retire. A rare voice of conservative politics in Silicon Valley, he aims to spend time helping elect candidates who he believes will advance former President Donald Trump’s agenda in the U.S. midterms elections later this year, according to Reuters.
Thiel is also a co-founder of online payments firm PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).
“Peter is truly an original thinker who you can bring your hardest problems and get unique suggestions. He has served on our board for almost two decades, and we've always known that at some point he would devote his time to other interests,” Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.
He will serve as a director until Meta's annual shareholder meeting but will not to stand for re-election, the Facebook-owner said.
Thiel became a shareholder of Facebook, a name it dropped last year, with an investment of $500,000. A 10% stake got him a seat on the board.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The start of the Beijing Winter Olympics has triggered a gold rush for winter sport goods in China, with online purchases of equipment and clothing from brands such as Anta Sports and Descente surging, and physical stores stripped bare.
The Chinese e-commerce firm JD (NASDAQ:JD).com's said sales of ski products on its platform for the period from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4 - the day of the opening ceremony - tripled from the same period last year. Ski goggle sales jumped 15 times and sales of figure skates and ice hockey sticks also jumped. 
Over the same period, sales of ski equipment and skating products on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Tmall marketplace rose 180% and 300% respectively, the company said. 
Neither platform provided sales figures.
Sales of down jackets made by China's Anta and Descente of Japan in the same period doubled from the previous year, JD.com said. 
Huang Xiaohu, a 34-year-old businessman in the northeastern city of Dalian, said he had driven to his local Decathlon store the day after the ceremony in search of a snowboard and ski clothes, only to leave empty-handed.
""Everything was sold out,"" he said. ""There were only socks left, but the choice of those was limited too.""
Anta, an official sportswear partner of the Beijing Games, led a group that paid 4.6 billion euros ($5.3 billion) three years ago for Finland's Amer Sports, whose portfolio includes European ski brands Atomic and Salomon, and Canadian outerwear brand Arc'teryx.
Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like lifestyle content platform, reported a spike in searches for Team Canada's red and white outfit and its manufacturer Lululemon after the opening ceremony. 
Makers of winter sports garments and equipment have been rushing to expand their presence in the world's second-largest economy, betting that the Olympics kindle enthusiasm beyond the Feb. 20 close in a nascent market. 
U.S.-based Spyder, KJUS and Mammut of Switzerland, Helly Hansen of Norway, Templa of Belgium, and Rossignol and Fusalp of France are among brands that have expanded into China in the last two years, while Goldwin of Japan and Head Sportswear of Austria opened their first stores in China in late December.
China hopes the Games turn it into a winter sports power: President Xi Jinping has set a target of getting 300 million Chinese involved in ice and snow sports, with the aim of building a 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) industry.
German fashion group Bogner, which makes upmarket winter jackets and ski wear, opened its first self-operated store in Beijing late last year and aims to open more 80 brick-and-mortar stores in China in partnership with Chinese brand Bosideng by 2025 that will sell two of its brands, Bogner and Fire+Ice.
Its down jackets sell for 8,000 to 22,000 yuan ($1,250 to $3,450) in China. 

""China's ski market is developing towards the high-end and Chinese consumers value individualism,"" said William Yang, general manager of Greater China Bogner. ($1 = 6.3623 Chinese yuan renminbi)

Young, in a statement on his website, criticized the music streaming platform's chief executive officer, Daniel Ek, saying he was the main problem, in the wake of criticism of U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan, who has courted controversy with his views on COVID-19 vaccines and his use of racial slurs.
Spotify hosts the top-rated podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast.
""In our communication age, misinformation is the problem. Ditch the misinformers,"" Young said in the statement.
The rock star pulled his content from the streaming platform last month after objecting to his music being played on the same platform as Rogan's podcast, over what Young said was misleading information on vaccines.
Several prominent figures including singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, guitarist Nils Lofgren and best-selling U.S. professor and author Brene Brown followed suit. 
Young also urged people to move their money out of multinational banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, calling them ""damage causers"" for their funding of fossil fuels.
Rogan has apologized for both the racial slurs and the controversy over COVID vaccines.
Young's comments come a day after Ek told his staff that while he condemned the slurs used by Rogan, the company would not be silencing him. 
Addressing employees of the music platform, Young said: ""I say Daniel Ek is your big problem - not Joe Rogan. Get out of that place before it eats up your soul.""
Young also urged fellow musicians and artists to take their output elsewhere.

The platform saw more than $2 billion wiped off its market value last week amid the uproar over COVID misinformation.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) fell 1.6% in premarket trading Tuesday after it said that co-founder John Foley is stepping down as CEO to be replaced by former Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) chief financial officer Barry McCarthy.
Peloton also said it will shed some 2,800 jobs - 20% of its corporate total - as it struggles to find a way to profitability without the tailwind of a pandemic that gave its growth a sugar rush in 2020 and 2021.
Foley has led Peloton its entire 10-year existence. He will become executive chair.
The co-founder's exit follows activist investor Blackwells Capital’s calls for his head and push for changes at the company that was a big pandemic winner. The reopening saw sales weaken as consumers reverted to their pre-pandemic exercise patterns.
The company also appointed two new directors - Angel Mendez and Jonathan Mildenhall. Erik Blachford will step down from the board after serving seven years.
The loss of more than 80% of its market cap since it touched $50 billion last year has made it a potential takeover target, according to various reports. The stock climbed 21% Monday on reports that Amazon AMZN and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) could be exploring bids.  Disney  DIS, Apple AAPL and  Sony  SONY are other likely bidders, reports said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp reported a 97% drop in quarterly profit and the collapse of a deal worth up to $80 billion to sell chip designer Arm on Tuesday, adding to pressure on the Japanese conglomerate to boost its sagging shares.
Masayoshi Son's investment giant reported a net profit of 29 billion yen ($251 million) in the October-December quarter versus a record 1.2 trillion yen a year earlier when its tech portfolio rallied.
SoftBank said it has dropped the sale of chip designer Arm to U.S. firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to regulatory hurdles. The scrapped deal marks a major setback for SoftBank's fund-raising plans as valuations again come under pressure from both growing investor caution and China's regulatory crackdown on tech firms.
""We were in the middle of a blizzard and the storm has not ended, it has got stronger,"" Son, SoftBank's founder and chief executive, told a briefing following the results. 
Investors are growing cautious about tech firms promising future profits as central banks pare back stimulus. 
SoftBank has also been whiplashed by exposure to China with shares of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), in which SoftBank has a stake, dropping by a fifth last quarter. 
SoftBank's Vision Fund unit reported an investment gain of 111.5 billion yen ($967 million), down from 1.4 trillion yen a year earlier.
""Even though some of the public companies have come down in value, there have been significant follow-on funding rounds where outside institutional investors have led those rounds,"" Vision Fund Chief Financial Officer Navneet Govil told Reuters.
Portfolio companies, including sports e-commerce firm Fanatics, held funding rounds during the quarter. 
SoftBank launched a 1 trillion yen buyback in November. Group shares closed down 0.9% ahead of the earnings and have lost about half their value since highs hit in March 2021. 
MARKET DISCONNECT 
Many SoftBank portfolio companies are trading below their listing price, with office-sharing firm WeWork, ride hailer Grab and used-car platform Auto1 all down last quarter. 
Such assets can be sold down or used as collateral for loans as SoftBank invests through its Vision Fund unit, which runs the $100 billion Vision Fund and a smaller second fund and has become the priority for the group. 
Vision Fund 2 had $51 billion in committed capital at the end of 2021 and has invested $43.1 billion in more than 200 startups by cutting smaller cheques.
""Its easier for us to enter and exit and the cycle gets faster,"" Son said. 
The Vision Fund unit has distributed $44.2 billion to its limited partners across both funds. 
Industry observers have noted a disconnect between frothy private markets and scepticism in public markets. 
""We are seeing some healthy rebalancing... at some of the more extreme ends of the market,"" Govil said. ""We did turn down quite a few transactions because we thought valuations were rich.""
Tuesday's earnings come at a watershed moment for the conglomerate as senior executives exit the firm, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, who led the restructuring of WeWork and launched the group's Latin American-focused fund. 
The departures have refocused attention on the 64-year-old Son's succession plans. The billionaire said he recently went bowling and scored highly in two games. 

""I thought to myself 'Hey I'm still pretty young'"", Son said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – BP ADRs (NYSE:BP) traded 1.5% higher in premarket Tuesday after the oil and gas giant rode record-high oil and gas prices to post its best profit in eight years.
Helping gains in the stock was the company’s promise to add $1 billion to its share buyback program as energy majors churn out cash again after a long dry spell.
The U.S.-Russia standoff over Ukraine, rebounding economies, a harsh winter and the reluctance and/or inability of OPEC and its allies to pump more have all combined to push energy prices to seven-year highs in recent weeks. Crude oil prices spiked above $93 a barrel last week, the highest since October 2014.
Being an integrated company helped as higher oil and gas prices resulted in better realizations in upstream operations while higher production volumes improved margins in the downstream refining business.
Adjusted net income was $4 billion in the fourth quarter, its highest since 2013, and compared to only $115 million last year.
Results in the trading business, which depend on using the volatility in prices to make profits, were weaker.
Overall, fourth-quarter sales and other operating revenue surged more than 91% to exceed $50 billion. Including other income, total revenue crossed $52 billion.
According to Redburn analysts quoted by Bloomberg, BP’s statement implies total repurchases of $6 billion for the year. That compares with Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) ongoing $10-billion buyback program and Shell's (NYSE:SHEL) $8.5 billion exercise just for the first half of 2022.

Investors should learn to stop worrying and start loving the European Central Bank’s hawkish pivot, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists. 
“The dramatic shift in rates, especially in Europe, is a sign that the problems that plagued Europe in the last cycle -- low nominal GDP growth, disinflation, no earnings -- are finally diminishing,” strategists including Sharon Bell and Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
When it comes to stock markets, “some of the biggest reasons for Europe’s longer-term underperformance have started to turn,” they said. 
Last week’s abrupt change of tone by ECB president Christine Lagarde caught investors off guard, triggering a sell off in European bonds and exacerbating declines for equities that were prompted by fears of Federal Reserve tightening. Fund managers and strategists are split on whether the rally that catapulted stocks to successive records can continue as major central banks turn off the liquidity taps. 
Goldman’s team is sanguine about the impact of rising yields on the sustainability of public finances in highly indebted countries, such as Italy, saying that higher borrowing costs will be offset by an expanding economy.
Bond Pain in Europe’s Periphery Shows Risks of Ending Stimulus
“We continue to expect strong growth in Europe, including in Italy and Spain, which we think will ultimately contain spreads near current levels as we approach lift-off,” the strategists wrote, adding that Italian stocks are already trading at a discount and won’t underperform as a result of the ECB’s pivot.
For Goldman’s team, higher rates also mean investors should stay overweight in attractively valued stocks such as European banks. While less stimulus could slow down growth and hurt lenders, such risk is not imminent, the strategists wrote.
 Low Valuations Favor Europe in These Testing Times: Taking Stock
“Value sectors, which were once low growth and very low return are also starting to see fundamental return improvements, most notably energy and telecoms,” according to Goldman’s note. On the flip side, higher rates may spell trouble for pricey growth stocks focused on technology, digital economy and renewables, as well as firms with weak balance sheets, they say.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded 0.6% lower in premarket Tuesday after the company shelved plans to buy Softbank's (T:9984) stake in chip designer ARM.
The purchase would have handed Nvidia a prized asset at a time when capabilities related to chip designing and manufacturing are rare. ARM offers its designs to more than 500 companies that make their own chips.
The Japanese investor consented to the termination and will retain the $1.25 billion prepaid by Nvidia, which will be recorded as profit in the fourth quarter. The chipmaker retains its 20-year ARM license.
“The parties agreed to terminate the agreement because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction, despite good faith efforts by the parties,” Nvidia said in a press release. ARM will now start preparations for a public offering within the year that ends March 2023, Softbank said in the same release. Its stock closed 0.9% higher in Tokyo trading. The investing giant holds about 25% of the U.K.-based company in its Vision Fund 1.
Nvidia had in September 2020 set an 18-month deadline to complete the takeover. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the transaction in December, arguing that Nvidia would become too powerful if it gained control over ARM’s chip designs.
The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, the regulator in ARM's home country, also opposed the deal. Approval was needed in China too where ARM has a joint venture with private equity firm Hopu Investments. There was no word from the authorities there.

The United States has banned imports of its products since October and last month Canada terminated a glove supply contract with the company due to the allegations. 
In addition to funds to cover the recruitment fees that its migrant workers paid, Supermax said it had made one-off goodwill payments of 5,000 ringgit ($1,200) each to all current workers on Monday and former workers are also set to receive the same amount.
Supermax said it will set up a fund overseen by an advisory committee to cover compensation costs.
Labour rights activist Andy Hall, who filed the petition to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to investigate Supermax, has said his interviews with the firm's workers showed the workers paid high recruitment fees - which resulted in debt bondage - faced unlawful wage deductions and lived in cramped conditions.
In response to the controversy, Supermax has said it will speed up a process it had begun in 2019 to meet the International Labour Organisation's standards for its employees' living and working conditions.
""Supermax has also engaged an international consulting firm to continue to assess and advise on the payout to all our current and former workers as well as to track and locate these workers that have returned to their home countries,"" it said on Tuesday.
Malaysian factories making everything from medical gloves to palm oil have increasingly come under scrutiny over allegations that they abuse foreign workers, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.

Other Malaysian latex glove makers and palm oil producers have also been banned by the United States in recent months.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank said on Tuesday it will recommend veteran German banker Martin Blessing as its new chairman, tasked with increasing profitability and steering the Danish lender through one of the world's biggest money laundering scandals.
Denmark's biggest lender said current Chairman Karsten Dybvad, a former head of the Confederation of Danish Industry and a senior civil servant before he took over three years ago, will not stand for re-election at a March 17 general meeting.
The bank will recommend Blessing, a former Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) chief executive and former co-president of UBS' Global Wealth Management unit, as his replacement.
Danske Bank is still trying to regain its footing after its involvement in a money laundering scandal in its former Estonia branch was revealed in 2018. 
The bank remains under investigation by authorities in Denmark, Estonia, France and the United States, and could be hit with major fines.
Its top shareholder, the holding company of the Maersk family that controls shipping giant Maersk, said in a statement it was ""highly supportive of Martin Blessing as successor and chairman candidate, given his extensive executive leadership experience in banking and strong personal values.""
Dybvad has overseen two major management changes since his election in 2018. In April, Carsten Egeriis took over as CEO from Chris Vogelzang who resigned after Dutch authorities named him as a suspect in an investigation into violations of money-laundering regulations at lender ABN Amro.
Danske is also struggling to cut costs, especially within compliance, and to boost top line growth. It is also facing legal action from investors, after the money laundering scandal erased around $15 billion of market value. 
Its shares rose as much as 3.3% and were up 2.9% by 0918 GMT, but still around 50% lower than levels seen four years ago.
""Dybvad has been chairman during a difficult time, but he has not made the difference,"" said Nordnet analyst Per Hansen. ""Danske Bank still has a lot of work ahead."" 

Blessing, who joined Danske's board in 2020, was also among a group of investors who last year launched European Fintech IPO Company BV, a so-called blank-cheque company that raises funds for the sole purpose of using the money for acquisitions.
""If elected, I will, together with the board of directors and in close cooperation with the bank's executive leadership team, ensure that Danske Bank continues the positive development,"" Blessing said in a statement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Maharashtra state will offer companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) new incentives to electrify their delivery fleets ahead of a 2025 target for cleaner air, its environment minister told Reuters.
One of India's richest states and home to the financial hub of Mumbai, Maharashtra is an important market for e-commerce, ride-hailing and food delivery companies. Last year, it set a target for such companies to electrify 25% of their fleet by 2025.
Now it wants to bring the target forward by offering companies higher incentives for bulk purchase of electric vehicles (EVs), the state minister, Aaditya Thackeray, told Reuters in an interview. 
""We are trying to be on the earlier side of 2025 and see if companies can get certain more incentives and move sooner. This not only benefits us in terms of cleaner air but also benefits them in terms of economies and their revenue models,"" he said. 
Companies the state is likely to approach in the next month include Amazon, Uber, Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed ridesharing firm Ola and food-delivery companies Zomato and Swiggy.
The push comes weeks after India's capital, New Delhi, issued strict draft rules https://reut.rs/3rx6dYg for companies to get a licence on condition that a certain percentage of their new fleet is electric.
The Maharashtra government has yet make its offer to the companies and Amazon, Flipkart, Uber, Ola, Zomato and Swiggy did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters about the possibility of speeding up the electrification process.
Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato and Swiggy have previously set out EV targets for 2025 and 2030, and Uber is working with EV companies to introduce electrification in its fleet. 
GREEN SHIFT
But the proposal to bring forward the target could worry some industry executives who fear a significant shift towards electric vehicles could come with costs because of a lack of affordable, long-range vehicles and insufficient charging infrastructure.
""When one state makes such a move it becomes a template for others to follow without fully understanding the business implications,"" said an executive with a fleet company who declined to be identified.
Thackeray, who is spearheading the state's broader climate-change agenda, says he is aware of the challenges and has plans to make Maharashtra a leading EV manufacturer.
The state is already a major auto hub and home to domestic carmakers like  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) that will invest in building more EVs, as well as global players like Mercedes Benz, which will assemble its luxury electric sedan there.
Maharashtra offers some of the highest incentives of any Indian state to EV manufacturers and buyers in the form of lower taxes. It is also building a network of charging stations along highways and in state-owned parking lots in Mumbai.
Thackeray plans to shift public transport to clean fuels and has mandated government departments to convert their vehicles to electric. He has also talked with investors on ways to boost investment in clean transport and energy.
""This whole shift towards a green economy ... it is a huge economic revolution. There is a lot of gain in terms of revenues for the country, profit for corporates and jobs for private individuals,"" he said.

But Thackeray says to increase EV supply and demand, India needs to lower import taxes on cars to allow companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, with which the state has held talks, to test the market.
""Global manufacturers need to see India as a major market. Once demand is created here they will naturally come and produce. Until then, we need to incentivise imports,"" he said.

It said M&S's sales rose 12.3% in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29 year-on-year, giving it a UK grocery market share of 3.6%, up 0.4 percentage points on the year.
Last month, M&S nudged up its profit outlook after it reported a strong Christmas, and hopes are rising its latest attempt at a turnaround could succeed after decades of false dawns.

The data echoed figures from rival market researcher Kantar published last week. However, Kantar does not include M&S in its monthly reports.
M&S also had weaker comparative sales numbers than the big four in the same period of 2020-21.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by robust results from energy giant  BP  (NYSE:BP) ahead of key U.S. inflation data later in the week.
By 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7%.
BP (LON:BP) reported a profit of $12.8 billion in 2021, the highest in eight years, as natural gas and oil prices soared and the global economy recovered from the pandemic slump.
The oil major also announced that it will repurchase another $1.5 billion of shares before it announces first-quarter results later this year, helping its stock, which has a heavy weighting in the benchmark FTSE 100 index, to climb 1.7% to a 52-week high.
Elsewhere,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) stock fell 3.5% after the French bank reported a drop in revenue at its important corporate and investment banking division of 1.5% in the final quarter of the year, despite otherwise very healthy results. BNP has been placing great importance on this division as it tries to compete with larger U.S. rivals in Europe.
Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock slumped over 9% after the online grocer reported a fall of more than 12% in annual core earnings, with investment in the business more than offsetting an increase in revenue.
Softbank (T:9984) announced earlier Tuesday its $66 billion deal to sell ARM to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which had faced widespread resistance from regulators, had fallen through. It will now look to take the British-based chip designer public in the next year.
Away from the corporate sector, the major focus of investors at present is the speed that central banks withdraw the emergency support that they put in place two years ago. ECB President Christine Lagarde's testimony in the European Parliament on Monday did little to change impressions, created at her press conference last week, that the bank is open to ending asset purchases and raising interest rates before the end of the year.
The Federal Reserve will receive another illustration of the inflationary pressures the U.S. economy is currently under on Thursday, with headline CPI seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year in January.
Back in Europe, Spain's industrial output rose 1.3% year-on-year in December, far weaker than the 4.4% growth that had been expected.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, continuing to drop after closing lower for the first time in seven sessions as the market focused on the resumption of nuclear talks between the West and Iran later in the session, which could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales.
While such an outcome could potentially increase global supply, talks have dragged on for more than a year since President Joe Biden took office and getting both sides to sign an agreement will prove difficult.
Investors will also look for U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures fell 0.6% to $90.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $92.00.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 01:50AM ET</span>",Beauty revival seen boosting end-of-year sales at L'Oreal,"By Mimosa Spencer
PARIS (Reuters) - The world's largest cosmetic group L’Oreal is expected to report brisk fourth-quarter sales on Wednesday after pandemic-weary consumers emerged from lockdowns to splash out on beauty products.
Investors will look for the impact of increased marketing spending on L'Oreal's margin, and tune in to executives' results presentation Thursday for any clues on whether sporadic lockdowns to curb the coronavirus might have weighed on cosmetic sales in China. 
The purveyor of Maybelline and Lancome brands does not disclose business targets. It is expected to post like-for-like sales growth of 9.3% for the last three months of the year, according to consensus estimates cited by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
In common with rival  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), L’Oreal is likely to have benefited from higher employment and rising wages in the United States, where consumers have been treating themselves to luxury products as socialising resumed. 
The trend is expected to boost L’Oreal's second-largest division, L’Oreal Luxe, which sells Yves Saint Laurent lipstick and Kiehl’s face cleansers. Last year, the unit acquired Youth to the People, a California-based label that sells skincare with vegan ingredients. L'Oreal shares have risen 21.5% over the last 12 months.
After cutting advertising and product launches when the pandemic hit in 2020, L’Oreal last year resumed spending on marketing and new products, including a line of Valentino cosmetics. 
L'Oreal also redirected its focus from physical stores to online distribution, training and recruiting stylists online and enlisting social-media influencers to plug brands such as its no-frills CeraVe skincare line, on TikTok.
Its operating margin is projected to have grown by 40 basis points over 2021, despite a 165-point margin expansion for the first half, according to Credit Suisse estimates. 
""Although the company’s strong topline growth and mix impacts might suggest that margin expansion should be stronger, we do not think L’Oreal will stray too far from its proven model of reinvestment and thus modest margin improvements,"" Credit Suisse analyst Eamonn Ferry said.

L'Oreal has steadily gained market share in the beauty and personal care market over recent years. Its 9.8% market share puts it ahead of rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Estee Lauder in the category, a position it has held since 2016, data from Euromonitor International shows.
Estee Lauder, which owns La Mer and Clinique brands, last week raised its annual revenue and profit projections after shoppers returned to stores over the holidays to stock up on makeup and skincare, undeterred by price hikes.

Hyundai said it will sell its Nexo SUV hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle and its Ioniq 5 midsize crossover electric vehicle (EV), which is at the heart of the company's attempt to capture 10% of global EV sales by 2025.
""We haven't yet set a target for sales, but we will try to provide more information once we begin taking orders online in May,"" the head of Hyundai Mobility Japan, Shigeaki Kato, said at a launch event in Tokyo.
Hyundai, which along with affiliate Kia Corp dominates neighbouring South Korea's auto market, made its first bid to capture market share in Japan in 2001, but left after selling only 15,000 cars.
Of the five million cars sold in Japan annually around nine tenths are Japanese brands, with Toyota Motor holding around a 40% market share. Outside of luxury models, foreign makers have struggled to chip away at that lead.
Booming demand for EVs, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc models, however, may mean a second chance for legacy manufacturers such as Hyundai, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Stellantis, the maker of Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) cars. 
Although only around 20,000 EVs were sold in Japan last year, the segment grew by almost a half from a year earlier even as overall car sales edged down. Imports of EVs jumped almost three times to a record 8,610 vehicles, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association (JAIA).

In a video message at the presentation in Tokyo, Hyundai CEO Jaehoon Chang apologized for the car company's departure 12 years ago. Only 600 Hyundai cars were still driving in Japan, he added. 
This time around, Kato later explained, Hyundai will focus on online sales, and is partnering with a car sharing service operated by online social gaming company DeNA Co and insurance company Sompo Holdings that lets private car owners rent out their vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are preparing for more downside in U.S. credit markets, as bets that the Federal Reserve will become more aggressive than previously expected threaten to further drive up yields and pressure prices.
After a comparatively placid January, corporate debt has started this month with sharp losses. The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a basket of credit default swaps that serves as a gauge of credit risk, recently stood at around 65 basis points after widening to its biggest spread since October 2020 on Friday following strong U.S. jobs numbers that sent government bond yields soaring to their highest level in more than two years.
Market participants worry there may be more downside ahead if Treasury yields, which affect rates across other asset classes, continue rising. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was recently at around 1.92% after reaching a high of 1.936% on Friday, its highest level since Jan. 2, 2020.
""There's nothing to stop the Fed from lifting rates now, and they're going to do it probably every quarter this year ... so when that happens, credit needs repricing,"" said Ryan O'Malley, fixed income portfolio manager at Sage Advisory. ""I think this has just begun."" 
O’Malley said he was avoiding some new debt issues in the primary market, even if attractive, believing their prices will fall to give him a better entry point. 
BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF - a major exchange-traded fund tracking the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market - is already down nearly 2% to $125.3 since the beginning of February, after a 3.6% drop in Jan. Its high-yield equivalent has fallen 1.3% since the beginning of February after falling 2.6% in the first month this year.
Steven Schweitzer, senior fixed income portfolio manager with the Swarthmore Group, is beefing up exposure to floating rate notes, expecting their coupon to rise along with the Fed funds rates as the central bank tightens monetary policy.
BlackRock’s iShares $ Floating Rate Bond UCITS ETF, which gives investors exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated floating rate bonds, is up 0.2% year-to-date, as investors factored in up to seven Fed rate hikes in 2022. 
""That's a pretty consistent theme that we're spending a bunch of time on, and investing in,"" Schweitzer said.
U.S. consumer price data, due out Thursday, could give investors more reason to get defensive on their bond portfolios if inflation proves stronger than expected. Consumer prices rose to their highest level in nearly four decades in December, reinforcing the case for a more aggressive Fed.
To counter the recent volatility, some investors have pulled back on riskier credit, as risk premiums - or what investors demand to hold corporate bonds rather than government-backed Treasuries - tend to widen when rates rise. 
Others, however, have done so only gradually, uncertain about how far the Fed is ready to go in tightening monetary policy as it attempts to quell inflation without hurting economic growth. 
Eric Gold, senior portfolio manager of high yield and head of the global credit team at MacKay Shields, has trimmed his allocation in triple-B and double-B credit, though he remains invested in the asset class on expectations that economic conditions should remain supportive for medium-to-high risk corporates. 
""While we are pulling back on the risk, we're not underweighting that risk,” he said. 
For the time being, most investors agree that the price swings are here to stay.

In a Monday note, analysts at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said they expected a ""benign"" outcome from central bank rate hikes for broader markets, but warned investors to ""brace for volatility along the way.""
""Volatility will continue to pervade the financial system until at least a couple more months of inflation, employment and geopolitical weather reports have been recorded and analyzed,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income, wrote last week.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 12:11AM ET</span>",Arm deal collapse leaves SoftBank asset sales in disarray,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - The collapse of SoftBank Group Corp's deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) marks a major setback to the Japanese conglomerate's efforts to generate funds at time when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure. 
The deal, which had met with industry opposition, fell through because of regulatory hurdles, a source told Reuters, with an initial public offering of Arm planned instead. 
Analysts have questioned the prospects for such a move, given SoftBank's earlier plan to sell Arm, and its IPO track record with many portfolio companies trading below their listing price.
""We are worried that a persistent overhang of SBG stake reduction will keep the stock from appreciating,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note dated Jan. 29 amid widespread expectation the deal would fall through. 
Any move would also have to contend with Arm's troubles in China, where its China-based joint venture is in a legal dispute with its original CEO, Allen Wu.
Under the collapsed deal, SoftBank, which bought Arm for $32 billion in 2016, was to receive $12 billion in cash and about 6.7-8.1% of Nvidia - worth up to $50 billion at current market prices.
Nvidia has become the most valuable U.S. chip company on the strength of its graphic processor chips, with shares gaining 82% over the past year.
SoftBank's shares were trading flat on Tuesday morning ahead of the group's earnings. A 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) buyback announced in November has helped support - but failed to reverse a slide in - the stock price, which is down by about half since last March's highs.
SoftBank and Nvidia declined to comment. Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The group has been funnelling money to its second Vision Fund, which had invested in more than 150 startups, but investors would like SoftBank to take further steps to boost shareholder returns, analysts say. 
""Investors would prefer to see asset sales. I think they would have preferred to see asset sales all along,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry. 
The conglomerate has a stake in e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), whose shares have fallen almost two-thirds since their peak in October 2020 amid a regulatory crackdown. 
Alibaba's recent registration of American Depository Shares led  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts to observe this week that the move ""might also suggest potential selling intention by SoftBank"". 

The pressure from sliding asset valuations comes at a watershed moment for the group as it winds down investing at the SB Northstar trading arm and senior executives exit the group The slide underscores the hard choices for SoftBank at a watershed moment for the group as it winds down investing at its SB Northstar trading arm and senior executives exit the group.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Battery maker LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) said on Tuesday it aims to boost sales by about 8% in 2022, forecasting a pick-up in demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries as a global chip shortage eases later this year.
The newly listed South Korean firm, which accounts for a fifth of the global EV battery market, swung to profit in the October-December quarter, even as the chip shortage affecting automakers led to weaker than expected demand for batteries.
LGES, which became South Korea's second-largest listed firm last month in the country's biggest ever IPO, posted an operating profit of 76 billion won ($63.5 million) for the fourth quarter, it said in its maiden earnings report.
That compares with a 150 billion won profit estimate by two analysts polled by Refinitiv and a loss of 479 billion won in the same period a year earlier.
Analysts noted that the global chip shortage has affected demand from automakers, with LGES rivals SK On and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd reporting a similar impact on battery demand in the fourth quarter.
Revenue at LGES, which supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) among others, rose 2% to 4.4 trillion won from a year earlier. 
The company said it has set this year's capital expenditure budget at 6.3 trillion won, up 58% from a year earlier, to finance capacity expansion at its global manufacturing facilities to meet demand for batteries.
""LGES will continue to move forward with bold investment plans needed in the long run. We are confident our business model of preparing for the future will definitely help us lead the industry,"" LGES chief executive officer Youngsoo Kwon said in a statement. 
LGES made a stellar market debut in late January, surging to a market capitalisation of about $98 billion, second only to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd on the local bourse, reflecting upbeat prospects for EV battery industry. 
The company's shares have since risen 8.5% and added a further 2.2% on Tuesday, ahead of a 0.8% rise in the broader market KOSPI.
Asked during an analyst conference call about more battery joint ventures with automakers, LGES said it had held working-level discussions with Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd about a potential joint venture, but there was no concrete agreement on a deal.
In January, a South Korean local newspaper reported that LGES planned to build a battery joint venture with Honda in the United States.
LGES said in late January that it plans to invest a total of $2.6 billion with GM to build their third joint battery plant in the United States, aiming to secure an annual capacity of about 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of batteries by 2025, enough to power about 700,000 EVs. The two companies are already building two joint battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee. 

Global EV sales, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, are forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte.

Inc  to remove the two brothers who co-founded the retailer, arguing allegations of sexual misconduct against one of them are holding the company back, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Legion Partners, which owns 2.5% of Guess (NYSE:GES), believes co-founders Paul and Maurice Marciano's ongoing involvement with the company casts a shadow over the company's activities, including recent positive steps by CEO Carlos Alberini, the person said.
Paul Marciano was sued last year by a model who accused him of having sexually assaulted her and model Kate Upton publicly accused him of sexual harassment in 2018. He resigned his position as executive chairman of Guess' board in June 2018 and was replaced by his brother, Maurice.
At the time Guess and Paul Marciano signed non-confidential settlement agreements for $500,000 with five people who had accused him of inappropriate conduct, according to a regulatory filing. 
Both men are now directors on Guess' eight member board and Paul also holds the title chief creative officer. Legion argues both must go; Paul because of his alleged behavior and Maurice for having ignored it, according to the person.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the story on Monday.
A representative for Guess, which is valued at $1.4 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The brothers founded the company in 1981 and own 38%, according to data from Refinitiv. In the last year, the company's stock price has dropped about 12%. 

The company hired Carlos Alberini three years ago and Legion likes the changes he has made, including cutting costs, said the source, who is not permitted to speak publicly about the private matter.
Legion has previously pushed for changes at retailers Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and places a heavy emphasis on corporate governance. In 2021, Legion returned 35%, according to investors in the fund.

The electric-car maker did not disclose the exclusion, which already affected tens of thousands of vehicles being shipped to customers in China, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and other parts of Europe, the report said, citing two employees and an internal correspondence.
Tesla decided against notifying customers as the part is considered a redundant backup and was not needed for the level 2 driver-assistance features, the report said, adding it was not clear if Tesla would make similar changes to the cars built in or shipped to the United States.

Tesla has fared better than most automakers in managing supply chain issues by using less scarce chips and quickly re-writing software.
It expects chip shortages to last through this year before easing next year. Chief Executive Elon Musk told an earnings call last month the shortage was not a long-term issue, with factories increasing capacity and automakers guilty of panic buying of chips which slowed the supply chain.

(Reuters) -Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd said it booked record quarterly net profit thanks to strong commodity markets and ""exceptional"" asset sales in infrastructure and other sectors, adding it should continue to benefit as interest rates rise.
Profit contribution from commodities trading and investment banking rose ""substantially"" in the third quarter, helped by volatile gas and energy markets, Macquarie said.
Investment banking fees were ""significantly up"" after the bank handled 126 transactions around the world worth a combined A$105 billion ($75 billion), with activity in the second half also expected to be high.
Macquarie, also the world's top infrastructure investor, does not disclose profit numbers in quarterly updates.
But the news of the record quarter lifted its shares nearly 5%, valuing the financial giant at around A$77 billion and contributing to a 1% gain for the broader market.
Macquarie ""was well placed to exploit emerging volatility in energy markets, particularly gas (but) has beat our own expectations,"" Citi analysts wrote in a client note, adding that they were raising their forecast for its annual profit.
Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake said the company should benefit as interest rates rise around the world - a prospect that economists expect as a result of surging inflation.
""In the early stages of rates increasing, especially if it's driven by increasing growth, it should be positive for the business,"" she said on a call with analysts.
Macquarie, which competes with Australian retail banks by selling deposit accounts and mortgages, said home loans grew 8% in the December quarter. 
""We have to see what the competitive dynamic does in terms of those rate increases and how those get passed to customers (but) generally it should be supportive,"" Wikramanayake said.
Australian retail banks hope hikes in interest rates from record lows, expected as soon as this year, will enable them to widen the profit margins that they collect on mortgages. 

Macquarie Asset Management's assets under management grew 2% to $750 billion from the previous quarter.

U.S. District Judge Rachel Kovner rejected Smalls' claim that Amazon had fired him because he is Black and had opposed discriminatory COVID-19 policies.
Smalls' allegation that Amazon subjected a largely non-white workforce to conditions inferior to that of its mostly white managers, by failing to provide necessary protective gear, failed on the merits as well, Kovner said.
Smalls had no immediate comment. Amazon did not immediately comment.
The online retailer terminated Smalls in March 2020, saying he joined a protest at its warehouse on New York City's Staten Island despite being on paid quarantine from close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19.
In the months since, Smalls has led an organizing campaign at the warehouse to create what he and peers call the Amazon Labor Union and demand safer conditions, higher wages and job security. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board said last month that the group could proceed with a union election.

Smalls' firing has remained an issue for New York state Attorney General Letitia James, who wants a court order requiring his reinstatement. Smalls has the option to file an amended complaint within 30 days, as well.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 08:16PM ET</span>",Frontier to buy Spirit Airlines in $2.9 billion budget carrier deal,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Aishwarya Nair
CHICAGO (Reuters) -Budget carriers Frontier Group Holdings and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc on Monday unveiled plans to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline in a $2.9 billion tie-up likely to tighten competition against traditional carriers.
The proposal to form a new no-frills carrier controlled by Frontier Airlines pushed up shares of Spirit as much as 18.7%, though several analysts pressed the airlines over possible difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval. 
""In a competitive industry like ours, the lowest costs always win,"" Frontier Chief Executive Barry Biffle told analysts. ""These low costs will, in turn, enable us to keep our fares low for customers.""
The move comes at a time when the U.S. airline industry is grappling with volatility in travel demand due to new COVID-19 variants. At the same time, costs are soaring on a combination of rises in wages, fuel prices and airport charges.
Spirit's wage expense as a percentage of revenue shot up by more than 10 points last year versus 2019. Higher fees prompted Frontier to exit airports such as Los Angeles and San Jose in California, and stop serving Washington-Dulles and Newark.
The merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022, is projected to result in synergies of $500 million a year, mainly through operational savings.
The companies pledged to avoid any job losses and add 10,000 direct jobs by 2026. They also promised the merger would deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings and offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.
Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge, said cost pressure is the biggest threat to recovery in the airline industry's profit. 
The merged company would be in an ""excellent"" position to combat rising operating costs, McNally said.
ANTITRUST HURDLE 
But some analysts warned the deal could face opposition from the White House as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration takes a tough stance on big corporate mergers. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to comment on the merger proposal. A White House spokesperson did not comment on the proposal but said the administration ""is committed to protecting competition across a wide range of industries for the benefit of consumers.""
The DOJ has filed an antitrust lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-preparing-challenge-american-jetblue-partnership-wsj-2021-09-21 against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports.
Biffle acknowledged the Frontier-Spirit deal would require DOJ approval but predicted it would be ""well received"" by regulators because it would lead to ""low fares to more people in more places"".
Data from Cirium, an aviation data company, shows the two carriers overlap in only 18% of their routes. 
Shares of Spirit Airlines closed up 17.2% at $25.46. Frontier's shares ended the day with a gain of 3.5% at $12.82.
Renowned airline investor Bill Franke, a pioneer of rock-bottom fares coupled with top-up charges offered by ultra low-cost carriers (ULCC), will be chairman of the new airline, whose brand name and CEO have not been announced.

The companies expect the deal to accelerate investment and help take on major U.S. airlines like American, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL).
The merger would be worth $6.6 billion including the assumption of net debt and operating lease liabilities.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 08:15PM ET</span>",Early Facebook investor Peter Thiel to step down from Meta board,"By Eva Mathews and Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc said on Monday that billionaire investor Peter Thiel, an early investor who has been on the company's board since 2005, has decided to retire.
Thiel aims to spend time helping elect candidates who he believes will advance former President Donald Trump’s agenda in the U.S. midterms, the Congressional elections this year, a person familiar with the situation said.
Thiel, a co-founder of online payments system PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and a rare voice of conservative politics in Silicon Valley, became a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) investor in 2004, when he provided $500,000 in capital at a $5 million valuation for a 10% stake in the company and a seat on its board of directors.
Thiel will serve as a director until Meta's annual shareholder meeting but will not to stand for re-election, the social media giant said.
""Peter is truly an original thinker who you can bring your hardest problems and get unique suggestions,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said, thanking Thiel for his service.
The announcement comes as Meta's shares have fallen sharply over concerns that privacy changes to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products was making it harder for advertisers to see how their ads work on Facebook. The stock fell 5.1% on Monday, and has lost a third of its value this year, but is still worth more than $600 billion.
Thiel left with kind words for Zuckerberg. ""His talents will serve Meta well as he leads the company into a new era,"" Thiel said in the statement announcing his departure from the board. 
He did not respond to a request seeking further comment.
Thiel was one of Silicon Valley's most prominent Trump supporters, speaking at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, where he hailed Trump as ""a builder."" He later served as an advisor on Trump's White House transition team. 
Thiel plans in particular to help Blake Masters, a Republican candidate hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, the person familiar with the situation said. He was also backing J.D. Vance, author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” and a Republican Senate candidate in Ohio, the person said. 

The billionaire has contributed $10 million each to political action committees supporting their individual candidacies, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks political donations. 
Thiel's backing of Trump was unusual in Silicon Valley and led to dispute with fellow Facebook director, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings. In a 2016 email to Thiel, Hastings called his support of the presidential candidate ""catastrophically bad judgment"" and questioned his fitness to remain on the board, according the Wall Street Journal, which reviewed the message.

(Reuters) - The metaverse will open up more ways for businesses to make money, an executive from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc told an advertising conference on Monday, in a presentation complete with a video showing holographic avatars fencing and playing basketball. 
The company's head of metaverse, Vishal Shah, cited opportunities for brands around digital goods and immersive shopping, speaking over video conference at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's annual leadership meeting in New York. 
""Without the physical limitations that exist today that put pressure on businesses' bottom line, things like real estate, supply chain and geographical reach, the metaverse will open up more opportunities for businesses to make money,"" Shah told the audience.
Facebook, which makes most of its revenue through digital advertising, changed its name to Meta in October to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play. 
On the advertising conference's agenda later this week is a fireside chat with Neal Stephenson, the science-fiction author who coined the term ""metaverse"" in his 1992 dystopian novel ""Snow Crash."" Stephenson will speak on the same day that features panels with Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc's marketing vice president and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co's head of global media investment.
Meta, which is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality. It has not shared many details about how brands will monetize in the metaverse.
Shah, who said the Foo Fighters would perform a concert in its virtual reality events app Horizon Venues after the Super Bowl on Sunday, pointed to the company's partnership with the National Football League that allows users to outfit their VR avatars with team jerseys as an experiment in digital goods.
Meta suffered major share losses week after reporting sputtering user growth and giving a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast, which it partially blamed on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes which have made it harder for brands to target and measure ads on Facebook and Instagram.

Shah said that before the metaverse is fully realized - which he said could be a decade away - businesses should continue to use its commerce channels on Facebook and Instagram and told advertisers to try out building augmented reality ads.
""Everything you're doing now across our apps will benefit you in this metaverse future,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on Tuesday on a bipartisan reform bill aiming to help Postal Service (USPS) save about $50 billion over a decade and requiring future retirees to enroll in a government health insurance plan.
USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities.
House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney said Monday the bill would put USPS on a stronger footing and save $50 billion over 10 years. 
If approved, the legislation moves to the U.S. Senate.
The bill eliminates requirements USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a requirement no business or other federal entity faces. USPS projects it would sharply reduce its pre-funding liability and save it roughly $27 billion over 10 years.
It requires future retirees to enroll in Medicare. About 25% of postal retirees do not enroll in Medicare even though they are eligible, which results in USPS paying higher premiums than other employers. USPS estimates the change could save it about $22.6 billion over 10 years.
The White House and postal unions support the bill as does the Greeting Card Association and Hallmark
One of the service's biggest customers, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), said https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/PSRA%20Support%20Letters.pdf it strongly backs the legislation.
""Americans across the country have long depended on the USPS for its reliable and affordable delivery options,"" Amazon Public Policy Vice President Brian Huseman wrote in a Feb. 2 letter to lawmakers. 

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in March 2021 proposed cutting $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade, which included https://about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/delivering-for-america/assets/USPS_Delivering-For-America.pdf#:~:text=The%20Plan%E2%80%99s%20strategic%20initiatives%20are%20designed%20to%20reverse,next%20ten%20years%20by%20achieving%20break-even%20operating%20performance financial reforms in the House bill. USPS also adopted new delivery standards in October https://www.reuters.com/world/us/slower-us-mail-standards-take-effect-friday-2021-09-29 that slow some first-class mail deliveries.
The bill requires USPS to maintain six-day a week mail deliveries and develop an online weekly performance data dashboard by zip code, and expands special rates for local newspaper distribution.

(Reuters) - Bluesky, a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Inc-funded project that is seeking to rebuild how social media companies operate, said on Monday Twitter co-founder and former chief executive Jack Dorsey will join the company's board.
Bluesky is working to build a technology that would allow different social media companies to operate on the same standard, which would enable developers to build apps that work across platforms and users to easily switch between the services. Dorsey first announced Bluesky in 2019, saying the effort would take years to build.
The vision to build a ""decentralized"" standard for social media comes as industries, including finance and tech are seeing a growing movement to transfer power or operations from central authorities like companies and governments to users.

Jay Graber, chief executive of Bluesky, said in a blog post on Monday that the organization will build and release ""a prototype that illustrates our approach.""
The Bluesky board also includes developer Jeremie Miller, who invented the technology that instant messaging services use to operate, Graber said.

(Reuters) - The former head of a Chicago bank was sentenced on Monday to a year and a day in prison for approving millions of dollars in risky loans in exchange for a post in the Trump administration. 
Stephen Calk, 57, former chairman and chief executive of Federal Savings Bank, was convicted in July of bribery and conspiracy after prosecutors accused him of helping greenlight $16 million in unsound loans to Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for then President Donald Trump. 
Calk's prison sentence is to be followed by two years of supervised release, including 800 hours of community service. He was also sentenced to pay $1.25 million dollars in fines. 
""It is important that we as a society not tolerate corruption and secret handshake deals,"" said U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield.
Calk will remain free on bail pending his appeal.
Prosecutors said Manafort recommended to Trump's post-election transition team that Calk be appointed Army secretary, the service's top civilian job.
Calk, who served in the Army reserves for 16 years, interviewed in January 2017 for a job as under secretary of the Army but never joined the administration.

Prosecutors had sought a sentence of between 51 and 63 months in prison to deter others. Calk's attorneys had asked for no prison time, saying he had lived an otherwise law-abiding life and was not motivated by greed.
Manafort was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2018 and sentenced to 7-1/2 years in prison, but was later released to home confinement. Trump pardoned Manafort in December 2020.

The publisher of ""NBA 2K"" and ""WWE 2K"" games also missed estimates for net bookings - the total amount products and services sold digitally or in stores - in the last three months of 2021, sending its shares 3% lower after the bell. 
The company has relied on the ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchise to bring in much of its revenue in recent years and last week teased the latest entrant in its best-selling game series.
But the botched launch last year of the remastered versions of old Grand Theft Auto titles, called ""The Trilogy"", has disappointed many gamers. 
""Very occasionally, we fall short. And I think The Trilogy was an example of that,"" said Chief Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick, referring to the glitches in the games.
The company's slate for the year includes ""WWE 2K22"", ""Kerbal Space Program 2"" and ""Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy"" for mobile. 
""Although GTA: Online continues to post solid growth ... the lack of content on other franchises is limiting growth,"" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Franco Granda said.
The weak results from Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO), which has made an offer to buy ""FarmVille"" maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), follow similar earnings from rivals Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA)
The video-game publishers are grappling with a slowdown in the pandemic gaming boom after COVID-19 curbs eased globally. 

Take-Two said it expected adjusted revenue between $808 million and $858 million for the fourth quarter, while analysts had estimated $924.24 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
It posted adjusted sales of $866.1 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, missing expectations of $874.56 million.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 05:40PM ET</span>",U.S. charges China's Hytera with conspiring with ex-Motorola staff to steal technology,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Monday it has brought criminal charges against China-based telecommunications company Hytera, accusing it of conspiring with Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI) employees to steal the American company's digital mobile radio technology.
In a partially redacted indictment unsealed in Chicago, the government said Shenzhen-based Hytera Communications Corp recruited Motorola employees in Malaysia to steal proprietary trade data about the radios, known as walkie-talkies. 
The indictment charges Hytera by name, but it redacts the names of other co-defendants in the case, at least some of whom are the now-former Motorola employees who the Chinese company is accused of recruiting. The indictment said Hytera recruited Motorola employees from 2007 through 2020, and that these workers received higher salaries and benefits than what they received at Motorola in exchange for stealing the trade secrets.
Hytera was charged with 21 criminal counts including conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets. Hytera and the unidentified other defendants were also charged with possessing or attempting to possess stolen trade secrets. If convicted, Hytera would face a criminal fine of three times the value of the stolen trade secrets.
In a statement sent by its attorneys, Hytera's said it is ""disappointed"" by the charges and ""respectfully disagrees with the allegations.""
""The indictment purports to describe activities by former Motorola employees that occurred in Malaysia more than a decade ago. Hytera looks forward to pleading not guilty and telling its side of the story in court,"" the company said.
Hytera added that it is ""committed to honoring the intellectual property rights of others.""
Mark Hacker, Motorola's executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement the charges against Hytera ""underscore the calculated and deliberate character"" of the Chinese company's illegal conduct.
""We will continue our civil litigation against Hytera in jurisdictions around the world to prevent Hytera's serial infringement and to collect the hundreds of millions of dollars in damages it owes to Motorola Solutions,"" Hacker added.
The former Motorola employees all signed confidentiality agreements at the time they were hired and later signed non-disclosure agreements after they left the company, the indictment said. It cited evidence that certain employees gained access to trade secrets through a Motorola database that they never had used in the past.
In one February 2008 email, an unidentified employee emailed another person to ask: ""Are we going to 'reuse' as much as possible or we need to develop most of them from scratch to avoid patent infringement?""
Hytera is a former distributor of Motorola Solutions products.
Motorola Solutions in February 2020 won a $764.6 million jury verdict in a trade secret theft and copyright infringement case against Hytera. A federal jury in Chicago found Hytera used Motorola Solutions' confidential documents and copyright-protected source code to compete in the market for two-way radio communications. Hytera told jurors it had developed its radios on its own.
Hytera later said the amount Motorola was awarded in the case was cut down by $221 million. 
The civil litigation between Hytera and Motorola is mentioned in the indictment. Prosecutors said that in 2017 an unidentified person emailed Hytera's CEO about ""aligning"" his story with the civil lawsuit.
The indictment indicates that a Hytera employee who testified in that civil trial lied under oath by claiming an employee of the Chinese company was fired in the fall of 2018 for failing to cooperate with an internal company investigation, when in fact this employee worked for Hytera from December 2018 through at least June 2020.
The criminal case against the company marks the latest blow for Hytera in the United States. 

In November, President Joe Biden signed legislation to prevent Hytera and other Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co that have been deemed security threats from receiving new equipment licenses from U.S. regulators. 
Under former President Donald Trump, recipients of federal funding were also banned from using telecommunications equipment made by Hytera.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Right-wing U.S. television network Newsmax Media Inc on Monday countersued Smartmatic Corp, an election security firm that says it was defamed by Newsmax's coverage of the 2020 presidential election.
Smartmatic sued Newsmax in November for amplifying false claims that Smartmatic voting machines rigged the election against then-President Donald Trump, who persists in falsely claiming his defeat was the result of fraud.
In a response filed in Delaware state court, San Diego-based Newsmax denied it defamed Smartmatic and claimed that the election software firm was trying to censor free speech and intimidate a critic.
""The action brought by Smartmatic against Newsmax arises from and is because of Newsmax's exercise of its right to free speech in connection with issues of public interest,"" Newsmax's lawyers said in the filing.
A Smartmatic spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Newsmax's counter-claim has little merit, said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who is not involved in the case.
Smartmatic has a strong defamation case that should proceed toward trial, Levinson added.
""The potential irony here is that if anyone is attempting to chill free speech, one could argue it's Newsmax,"" Levinson said. 
Smartmatic, whose U.S. headquarters is in Boca Raton, Florida, in February has also sued https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/murdoch-emails-loom-large-billion-dollar-election-lawsuits-against-fox-news-2021-12-14 Fox News, a subsidiary of Fox Corp, and One America News Network over their election coverage.
Another voting machine firm, Dominion Voting Systems Corp, has brought similar lawsuits. Like Smartmatic, Dominion is seeking billions of dollars in damages.

The networks have said they reported on matters of public concern and their reporting is protected by the free speech protections in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Fox News has asked https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-questions-fox-news-bid-shake-smartmatics-27-bln-election-lawsuit-2021-08-17 a state court judge in New York to dismiss Smartmatic's lawsuit. The judge has not yet ruled on the request.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street shares finished broadly lower on Monday, while European stocks rose following five straight weeks of declines and European bond yields soared on speculation of monetary tightening.
Markets are on alert for rate rises in both the euro zone and the United States after the ECB last week was considered to have adopted a more hawkish tone. The United States reported stronger-than-expected jobs and earnings data.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Monday calmed some of those jitters, saying there were no signs that measurable monetary policy tightening would be required.
Major Wall Street stock indexes were mixed throughout the session on Monday before ending down as markets digested mixed quarterly results from megacaps Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms.

Meta shares fell more than 5%, extending losses for the third session after its record plunge last week. Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) jumped over 20% on media reports of interest from potential buyers including Amazon.
""The market's inability to rally on Friday's strong payroll data, and generally poor stock reactions to Q4 results despite healthy earnings delivery, illustrate the overly bearish market sentiment at the moment,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a market note.

Italy and Greece continue to have ""buffers"" in place to protect them from rising borrowing costs and there is a reasonable chance that Greece's credit rating could be upgraded soon, one of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s top analysts told Reuters on Monday.

Peloton's shares were set for their best day since their debut in Sept. 2019. They earlier rose as much as 31% in the session.
Amazon is exploring an offer for Peloton, a source told Reuters on Friday, while Nike too, reportedly, is weighing a bid for Peloton, which touched new records last year as its bikes sold like hot cakes during the pandemic when people were stuck at home.
Amazon.com, Nike and Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bearish bets on Peloton's shares have increased recently with estimated short interest as a percentage of free float nearly doubling over the past two months to 14.1%, according to data from analytics firm Ortex.
""Even though short sellers in PTON have losses of about $250 million since Friday's close, they are still in significant profit,"" said Ortex's co-founder, Peter Hillerberg. Peloton's shares were down over 84% in the past year. 
Last month, activist investor Blackwells Capital urged Peloton to fire its chief executive officer and put the company up for sale.
""Peloton's founder John Foley, who has attracted the ire of activist investors on governance grounds, might be an obstacle to any deal given the veto power he enjoys under the firm's dual share class structure,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at UK-based investment platform AJ Bell.

Meanwhile, Cowen and Co analyst John Blackledge believes Peloton would not be an ideal fit for Amazon as the e-commerce giant typically sells mass market products and services, whereas Peloton's products are positioned as premium.
Peloton is slated to report second quarter results Tuesday after market close.

Investing.com - After last week's fireworks, markets started this week on a muted note, with the S&P 500 dipping .3% and the NASDAQ Composite closer to .6%. Major tech earnings were the spark for many of last week's moves, and the earnings and economic events slate on Monday didn't compare.
Which sets up for a busier Tuesday, as several economic giants or companies majorly affected by the pandemic will report. As investors look for more clues on where consumer demand is headed, how much inflation is persisting, and what that might mean for the market, a global pharma kicks off the key events. Here's what to watch for on Tuesday:
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is due to report before market open, with the pharma giant expected to report $.87/share of earnings and revenue of $24.16B, both double last year's numbers, per analysts polled by Investing.com. As it seems like much of the world is easing out of the Omicron wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pfizer's commentary on any further need for boosters will be of note, as will any updates on their Covid-19 pill treatment and any meaningful non-Covid programs.
In the pandemic-related category, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) reports after the bell, which may end up being less notable for the company's ongoing performance which, per the reports, is not great, and more for any clues on the possibility that the company is open to bidders.
Inflation is the other big theme to watch in this earnings season. Tex-Mex restaurant operator Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) reports after the bell, and is expected to show 21.7% topline growth and 51% earnings growth. Food distributor Sysco (NYSE:SYY) will report earnings before market hours, and is expected to show 37.8% revenue growth. The two firms, coming from different parts of the food chain, may provide interesting commentary on the endurance of inflation and how much companies are passing on these costs to their customers.
With oil having an exceedingly rare down day on Monday, the API Crude report will clock in as both the first major oil data point of the week and a potential catalyst for the next move. Last week saw a draw of 1.645M barrels, the second consecutive week of inventory decreases, and with no sign of easing tensions on the Russia/Ukraine front and last week's cold front, upward pressure may continue to support the commodity."

Investing.com - Take-Two delivered quarterly guidance that fell short of estimates after reporting mixed fiscal third-quarter results as revenue was weighed down by softer-than-expected net bookings.

The U.S. has engaged with China’s government on the shortfalls, but hasn’t seen any real signs of the nation making good on its commitments over the last several months, the officials said, asking not to be named without permission to speak publicly.
While China continues to talk with the U.S., the Biden administration wants the nation to take concrete action, and that hasn’t happened, the officials said. The administration is continuing to press China to comply, but sees the experience thus far as illustrating the limits of the so-called phase-one deal that it inherited, the officials said.
China didn’t meet the purchasing targets in the agreement, in which it pledged to buy an extra $200 billion in U.S. agriculture, energy and manufactured products over the 2017 level in the two years through the end of 2021. At the same time, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has said repeatedly that the Biden administration’s concerns go beyond the purchase commitments and include Beijing’s state-centered industrial policy.
While U.S. December data won’t be available until Tuesday, data through November show that China’s imports from the U.S. amounted to less than 60% of its pledges. Beijing also committed to combat the theft of U.S. intellectual property and open up its domestic market to U.S. financial service providers.
The Biden administration took months at its start to review its predecessor’s policy toward China and deliberate on a new direction to deal with Beijing’s economic practices, putting its initial focus on domestic policy and Covid-19 relief. The U.S. has maintained tariffs on more than $300 billion of annual Chinese exports as leverage.
Biden last month said that he’d like to be in a position to say that China is meeting more of the nation’s commitments and therefore some tariffs can be lifted, but “we’re not there yet.” 
Last month, both Tai and her deputy in charge of Asia, Sarah Bianchi, said talks with Chinese counterparts on trade issues have been “difficult.”
China’s lack of compliance with the deal is the purview of the USTR and the White House is in close touch with Tai’s office about updates on the process, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

(Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Crescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) Corp is looking to sell some of its assets in Alberta and Saskatchewan that could fetch around C$500 million ($394 million), according to an industry source and marketing documents seen by Reuters on Monday.
Crescent is offering the assets for sale in three separate packages, according to the marketing documents. Combined, the assets are estimated to have output around 10,554 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, the documents showed.
The company has retained National Bank Financial Markets as its adviser on the planned sale, according to the marketing documents.
Crescent Point and National Bank did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
With U.S. oil prices over $90 a barrel, the highest in seven years, oil and gas producers have been encouraged to raise cash by selling non-core assets to clean up their balance sheets or boost shareholder returns.
Crescent has been eyeing sales of non-core assets since it took over European oil major Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's Kaybob Duvernay assets for C$900 million in February last year.
The Canadian company, which sold some conventional oil and gas producing assets in southeast Saskatchewan for C$93 million in June, hiked its quarterly dividend by 50% and announced up to C$100 million in share repurchases in December.

(Reuters) -Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has reached a settlement worth $225 million to resolve claims the drugmaker fueled an opioid epidemic in Texas by improperly marketing addictive pain medications, the state's attorney general said on Monday.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Teva agreed to pay $150 million over 15 years and provide $75 million worth of generic Narcan, a medication used to counter the effects of opioid overdoses.
The deal is the largest Teva has struck in the more than 3,500 lawsuits it faces seeking to hold it and other drug companies responsible for an opioid abuse epidemic that led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the last two decades nationally.
The Israeli drugmaker previously settled with Oklahoma and Louisiana. Teva did not admit wrongdoing as part of Monday's settlement.
Teva has long sought to resolve the thousands of opioid lawsuits by state, counties and municipalities it faces, offering in 2019 to donate $23 billion in opioid addiction treatment drugs and pay $250 million over 10 years.
Attorneys general from four states, including Texas, negotiated that proposal with Teva. But no nationwide settlement agreement ultimately resulted after lawyers for some of the plaintiffs questioned the true value https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioids-teva-focus/tevas-proposed-opioid-settlement-could-cost-drugmaker-pennies-on-the-dollar-idUSKBN1X22F6 of the drugs.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc said on Monday it received a subpoena from the U.S. securities regulator related to a settlement that required Chief Executive Elon Musk's tweets on material information about the company to be vetted.
The subpoena by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was issued on Nov. 16, some 10 days after Musk asked his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers https:// if he should sell 10% of his stake in the company, triggering a stock selloff. 
As of last close, the electric-car maker's shares had fallen by nearly a quarter since the tweet. The shares were down 1.4% at $909.98 on Monday morning. 
The SEC's latest action, which was disclosed in a securities filing by the automaker, adds to pressure on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) from federal auto safety regulators regarding vehicle recalls https://reut.rs/3J6zUFB and investigations related to its driver-assistance software. The SEC declined to comment. 
In 2018, Musk settled a lawsuit https:// by the SEC over his tweet on taking the company private, agreeing to have the company's lawyers pre-approve tweets with material information about the company.
Tesla in December https://reut.rs/3LecIHk was hit by a lawsuit over Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down the company's share price. This was not the first lawsuit accusing https://reut.rs/3slo0Rh Musk of violating the settlement terms.
Reuters reported last year that the SEC has opened an investigation https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06 into a whistleblower complaint that Tesla failed to properly notify its shareholders and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects over several years.
Tesla said on Monday it ""routinely"" cooperates with government subpoenas and other investigations and inquiries.
In the filing, the company also said the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing investigated allegations of race discrimination and harassment in Tesla workplaces and gave notice that it has grounds to file a civil complaint against the electric-car maker. 
Tesla has already been battling a series of lawsuits on racial abuse and sexual harassment, and a federal jury in October ordered the company to pay $137 million to a Black former contract worker in one of the cases. 
New York State Common Retirement Fund said on Monday that it has filed shareholder proposals with Tesla, Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), requesting they report on their efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination against employees. 
The proposals ask the companies to disclose, among other things, the total number and aggregate dollar amount of disputes settled related to sexual abuse or harassment or discrimination. 
MUSK-WHITE HOUSE TENSION
Tesla and the White House have been at odds over the past few months, with the Biden administration focusing on legacy automakers, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) in the electric vehicle race.
Last month, GM and Ford's CEOs attended a meeting of tech and auto companies hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden. Musk was not on the list of attendees. 
Musk has been using his Twitter account to attack the Biden administration for allegedly ignoring Tesla and holding up Detroit automakers as leaders in the shift to electric vehicles. Musk called Biden a ""damp sock puppet https:// in a tweet last month.
Musk is also feuding https://reut.rs/3sr49QZ with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, a key ally of Biden's. The National Labor Relations Board in March ordered Musk to delete a tweet that said Tesla workers could lose stock options if they voted to join the UAW. Tesla is appealing that order.

Tesla said on Monday the fair market value of the electric-vehicle maker's bitcoin holdings as of Dec. 31 was $1.99 billion.
The company, which had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin last year before selling 10% of the holding, said it registered about $101 million in impairment losses last year due to the value of bitcoin.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senior Democrats in the U.S. Senate are pressing JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) for details on how they take overdue credit card borrowers to court.
In a letter sent to the bank on Monday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown pressed for specifics on how the bank tries to collect on overdue credit card debt, and in particular if the bank uses ""robo-signing"" to quickly process legal documents without proper review.
""We request that Chase provide detailed information regarding the bank’s credit card debt collection practices. Chase should not utilize robo-signing in pursuing these debt collection suits, or any other debt,"" wrote Brown, along with five other Senate Democrats.
While the bank has been fined by regulators for robo-signing in the past, a bank spokesman denied any claim the bank was doing so now, saying a trained employee reviews each affidavit the bank files individually to verify the information, which is then quality-checked by a second employee before it is filed.
""This is just false. There is nothing automated in the way these trained employees review the affidavits,"" said Thomas Kelly, the bank spokesman.
""If ultimately we can’t reach a repayment plan, we pursue litigation as a last resort. We file litigation in less than 0.1% of all credit card accounts,"" he added.
In 2015, the bank agreed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-credit-debt-settlement/exclusive-jpmorgan-to-pay-over-125-million-to-settle-u-s-credit-card-debt-probes-idUSKCN0PI00520150708 to pay over $200 million in refunds and penalties after financial regulators found it relied on robo-signed documents, in which an employee signed an affidavit alleging facts to the court without personal knowledge of them.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said at the time the bank's failure to systematically review its legal statements resulted in calculation errors in some lawsuits that resulted in judgments against borrowers for incorrect amounts.

The Democrats' questions were prompted by a January story published by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum, which found JPMorgan was increasing the number of lawsuits filed against overdue credit card borrowers, after previously halting the practice in 2011.
Kelly said the bank resumed litigation in 2019, after informing regulators.

Investing.com — Shares of CF Acquisition Corp VI (NASDAQ:CFVI), a blank check company, have rallied 33% to all-time highs Monday after Rumble, a “neutral video” platform, publicly offered Joe Rogan a deal to bring his podcast shows to their platform.
Rumble is set to go public via a SPAC merger with CF Acquisition in the second quarter. 
Recently, various complaints have been made regarding episodes of Rogan's podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" including alleged misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines and use of racial slurs. The criticisms have also been directed at Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), and over the weekend, several episodes were removed from the platform after a discussion between Rogan, his team and the music streaming giant.
Comedian, UFC commentator and podcast host Rogan, signed an exclusive deal to move ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" to Spotify in 2020. It currently has millions of loyal listeners, including Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski who wants to take Rogan's podcast to the Rumble platform.
In a letter posted on Rumble's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) page, Pavlovski says they stand with Rogan and his fan's ""desire for real conversation.""
""How about you bring all your shows to Rumble, both old and new, with no censorship, for 100 million bucks over four years?"" read the letter.
""This is our chance to save the world. And yes, this is totally legit,"" concluded Pavlovski.








Rumble recently announced a record-breaking January for user engagement and posts, and getting Rogan onto the platform would be a big move.Spotify is down 1.6%.

Rogan is also facing backlash for COVID-19 misinformation in his program hosted on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), after singer-songwriters including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their content from the streaming platform.
The incidents prompted Spotify to add a ""content advisory"" to any episode featuring discussion of COVID-19 as scientists and medical professionals urged the platform to prevent Rogan from spreading falsehoods.
""Dear Joe, we stand with you, your guests and your legion of fans in desire for real conversation,"" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in an email to Rogan posted on Rumble's twitter page on Monday. 
""How about you bring all your shows to Rumble, both old and new, with no censorship, for 100 million bucks over four years?""
Rogan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
His show, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" has become one of the most popular podcasts on Spotify after the streaming platform started featuring it in 2020. The Wall Street Journal had then reported that Spotify's exclusive licensing deal for the show was worth more than $100 million. 

Shares of CF Acquisition VI, the SPAC that has agreed to take Rumble public, surged more than 18% on the news. The deal, announced in December, had valued Rumble at $2.1 billion.
Launched in 2013, Canada-based Rumble has also entered an agreement to deliver video and streaming for Truth Social, former U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed social media app.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 01:08PM ET</span>",Pfizer's COVID cash pile opens opportunities for deals,"By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Investors on Tuesday hope to learn  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s plans for what could be a once-in-a-generation cash infusion from COVID-19 treatments and vaccines in 2022, with some looking for the drugmaker to spend on deals. 
Pfizer's 2021 sales are expected to top $80 billion - its highest ever annual figure, according to Chief Executive Albert Bourla. Analysts expect revenue to top $100 billion in 2022 as production of Pfizer's oral antiviral treatment Paxlovid picks up.
The 173-year-old U.S. drugmaker expects 2021 sales of $36 billion and another $29 billion in 2022 just for its COVID-19 vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). 
Pfizer has said it books profit in the high 20s percent of vaccine revenue.
Expectations are also high for Paxlovid, which is being used in the United States and has been authorized in Canada, UK and Europe.
Analysts on average have forecast sales of nearly $23 billion this year. The U.S. purchase contract alone - for just one sixth of Pfizer's expected 2022 production of 120 million Paxlovid courses - topped $10 billion. 
Profits from the drug are expected to be high.
""What are they actually going to do with all this cash?"" said Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan, adding that Pfizer may need to bring in new experimental drugs to replace sales from those losing patent protection in the next few years. 
""Is future growth coming from the vaccine and Paxlovid, or are they buying things to boost their pipeline? I think we want to see them do more things like that to build their pipeline,"" Divan said.
Pfizer's profit surge comes at an opportune time for deals. The Nasdaq biotechnology index is down more than 21% in the past 12 months. 
""There was very little M&A in biotech last year and that’s one of the things that held the sector back. Biotech investors expect and are hoping that it picks up this year, and we think Pfizer is going to be a major driver of M&A,"" said healthcare investor Brad Loncar.
In 2021, Pfizer bought Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc for $6.7 billion in cash and cancer drug developer Trillium Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TRIL) for $2.3 billion.
Pfizer also could take other steps to reward shareholders.
""They’ve had such a flood of money come in that there might be a component of buybacks or dividend to Pfizer's capital deployment, but the main event will be M&A,"" Loncar said. 

Pfizer's dividend yield of roughly 3% compares favorably to the nearly 2% dividend yield for the Dow Jones industrial average index.
Pfizer's shares have risen over 50% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 17% gain for the S&P 500 index in the same time period. Prior to the pandemic, Pfizer's shares traded in a range below $44 for several years.

Investing.com – Zimmer Biomet stock (NYSE:ZBH) plunged 7.5% Monday after the company fell short of fourth-quarter estimates for both revenue and earnings.
The pandemic continues to weigh on the company, a phenomenon seen at many healthcare and medical devices companies as several patients continue to defer their health procedures.
""As we expected, the ongoing COVID pandemic continued to pressure our business in Q4. The quarter was particularly impacted throughout December due to hospital staffing shortages and the Omicron variant surge worldwide,"" Chairman, President and CEO Bryan Hanson said in a company statement.
The company also blamed China’s volume-based procurement in knees, hips and spinal segments for the shortfall in both revenue and earnings.
Fourth-quarter net sales fell 2.3% to $2 billion, mainly because of slippages in the Americas and Asia Pacific as the regions came under the onslaught of the pandemic again, this time due to Omicron. Product-wise, revenue in both knee and hips fell.
Zimmer is spinning off its dental and spine businesses into a separately listed entity, ZimVie. The transaction is expected to close on March 1.
For the current year, the company is projecting revenue to erode by a maximum 4% or stay flat at 2021 sales of $6.8 billion after accounting for the separation of the dental and spine business. Adjusted profit per share is seen at $6.60 at the midpoint of the company’s guidance range.
Fourth-quarter adjusted profit per share fell 16 cents to $1.95.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Stock indexes around the globe traded mixed on Friday despite strong Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings, while gold prices slipped under pressure from a firmer dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields as upbeat U.S. jobs data bolstered the case for Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Earlier in the session, a sell-off in bonds briefly pushed Germany's 5-year yield positive for the first time in four years after the European Central Bank was more hawkish than expected.
Asian equities held firm overnight after better-than-expected earnings from Amazon, in contrast to the heavy selling on Thursday following Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms' earnings miss.
The STOXX 600 lost 1.42% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18%.
On Wall Street, U.S. stocks were mixed. U.S. government bond yields moved up amid the positive jobs data and better earnings.
""So much for the good news from Amazon - today’s jobs data puts 50 basis points back on the table for the Fed’s March meeting,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for North Carolina-based Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25% and the S&P 500 gained 0.18%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.97%.
Market sentiment has been dominated by speculation about the trajectory for rate hikes from major central banks this year, as pressure mounts for policy moves to combat inflation. Rate hikes typically hurt riskier assets such as stocks.
In a move labeled by analysts as a ""pivot,"" European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was more hawkish than expected at the central bank's meeting on Thursday. She acknowledged mounting inflation risks and declined to repeat her previous guidance that an interest rate increase this year was ""very unlikely.""
The dollar index rose 0.091%, with the euro up 0.11% to $1.1451.
""Central banks are actively trying to tighten financial conditions ... they are moving faster than expected,"" said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho.
European government bond yields also rose. Germany's 5-year yield briefly turned positive as traders priced in ECB rate hikes this year. Germany's 2-year yield was set for its biggest weekly rise since 2008.
Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes hit their highest levels since January 2020 after strong payrolls data showed the U.S. economy added 467,000 jobs last month.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said markets were now facing ""the largest quantitative tightening in history"" from May onwards, with G4 central bank balance sheets set to shrink by $2.2 trillion over the next 12 months.
But Australia's central bank was still content to keep policy ultra-loose in its quarterly statement on monetary policy, even as it sharply revised up its outlook for inflation and projected unemployment at 50-year lows.
The Bank of Japan also brushed aside the view it could follow in the footsteps of its more hawkish U.S. and European peers.

The cryptocurrency bitcoin has strengthened in the past week but, at just under $38,000, remains far below the all-time high of $69,000 it hit last November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Monday it was issuing draft guidance seeking to protect aviation employees who perform government certification duties from interference by airplane manufacturers and others.
Congress in December 2020 approved legislation boosting FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections in the wake of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month U.S. grounding.
An FAA survey released in August 2020 found some safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
Agency employees reported being ""over-powered in meetings with industry."" Boeing did not immediately comment Monday.
The draft guidance, which is open for comment, ""calls for manufacturers to monitor, report and investigate all allegations of interference and to report the results to the FAA. It also establishes a clear path for these employees to speak freely with FAA certification officials at any time.""
In November, the FAA told Boeing that some of its appointees overseeing aircraft certification tasks lack expertise and directed the largest U.S. planemaker to quickly address the issue.
In a Nov. 2 letter seen by Reuters, the FAA told Boeing an oversight review conducted this summer found some appointees did not have required expertise and found some of those Boeing employees performing certification tasks for the agency ""are not meeting FAA expectations.""
Under the reform law, the FAA in January began exercising new oversight over selection of candidates who perform safety work on the FAA's behalf.

Boeing is nominating candidates but FAA must approve or reject them.
Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department into the MAX certification as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.

(Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc shares climbed more than 11% to an all-time high on Monday after the company reported that first-quarter profits nearly doubled due to soaring U.S. meat prices.
Shares rebounded from a one-month low on Friday to reach a record $99.20, up 14% from the start of the year.
The surge reflects strong demand and high prices for Tyson's beef, pork and chicken, as U.S. labor shortages have limited production. 
""Customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply product,"" Chief Executive Donnie King said.
Increased prices and profits threaten to amplify Washington's scrutiny of the U.S. meatpacking industry, as the Biden administration has criticized a lack of competition in the sector.
Tyson and three other industry behemoths slaughter about 85% of grain-fattened cattle carved into steaks for consumers.
The average price for Tyson's beef surged 31.7% in the quarter ended on Jan. 1, while the unit's operating margins jumped to 19.1% from 13.2% a year ago. Average prices for all of Tyson's products climbed by 19.6%.
Overall sales for beef soared about 25% to $5 billion, helping Arkansas-based Tyson's sales rise 24% to $12.93 billion in the quarter. Analysts, on average, were expecting revenue of $12.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable rose to $1.12 billion and excluding items, Tyson earned $2.87 per share, beating estimates of $1.95 per share.
Tyson said it raised meat prices to offset higher costs for labor, transportation and grains used for animal feed. Its cost of goods rose by 18% in the quarter, and King told reporters he expects grain prices will continue to rise.

To respond, Tyson restructured its chicken pricing strategy to make it more flexible and has asked customers to pay for freight rates that jumped 32%, King said.
""They're dealing with a very inflationary environment across kind of all their businesses,"" said Adam Samuelson, lead agribusiness analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Jury selection began on Monday in the U.S. corruption trial of a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker accused of helping to launder hundreds of millions of dollars looted from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund and bribing officials to win business.
Roger Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of conspiracy to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law.
Goldman helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, a fund former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak launched to spur economic development.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 12:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Spanish oil major Repsol looking to sell parts of its Canadian assets -sources,"By Shariq Khan and Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - Spanish oil major Repsol (OTC:REPYY) SA is considering putting some of its Canadian assets for sale later this year as it looks to reap the benefits of higher oil and gas prices, four sources told Reuters on Monday.
Repsol is seeking buyers for its holdings in the Duvernay basin, in western Canada, which are still in early development stages, according to its website. The company's 170,000 acres (688 square kilometers) in the Duvernay could fetch about C$750 million ($589.9 million), according to an industry source.
The move by Repsol follows several global oil majors which have rushed to sell assets in the No. 4 oil-producing country over the past four years over concerns ranging from high production costs and emissions to scarcity of capital for fossil fuel projects. Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO) Ltd, whose majority owner is U.S. oil producer  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), marketed its Canadian joint venture last month while Japan's JAPEX sold its stake in the Hangingstone oil sands project last year and Abu Dhabi's TAQA hired advisors to sell all of its Canadian oil and gas producing assets
Repsol also owns assets in Alberta's Greater Edson and Chauvin basins, along with gas- and power-related infrastructure. Repsol has not made a final decision on any of the assets, the sources cautioned, adding that among the options it could consider are partial sell-downs or joint ventures.
Repsol, whose total annual Canadian production was 57,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, could still choose to retain the assets as is, they said.
The sources requested anonymity as the discussions are confidential. A Repsol representative said the company does not comment on market speculation.
Repsol bolstered its Canadian business with the $8 billion purchase of Talisman Energy in 2015. Four years later, with oil prices languishing, Repsol cut 30% of its Canadian staff as part of a global restructuring.
After the coronavirus pandemic pushed U.S. crude prices into negative territory for the first time ever in 2020, and investors applied greater pressure for fossil fuels companies to transition to cleaner energy, Repsol unveiled a five-year plan to cut upstream spending and boost low-carbon investments. 
North American crude hit $90 per barrel last week, notching seven-year highs, spurring asset sellers to look to cash in. The strong recovery has also encouraged Repsol to make natural gas purchases in areas considered more profitable.

The Spanish company in January bought U.S. gas producer Rockdale Marcellus, and has been eyeing additional purchases in the U.S. Eagle Ford basin, two sources familiar with transactions in the country told Reuters.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Energizer Holdings stock (NYSE:ENR) traded 2.4% higher Monday after the company maintained its annual outlook despite rising cost pressures.
First-quarter sales fell slightly to $846 million while costs rose.
“We continue to see escalating input cost pressures in transportation, labor and materials, and remain focused on offsetting them through additional pricing and ongoing cost controls,” Chief Executive Officer Mark LaVigne said in a company statement.
Higher operating costs including transportation, material and labor eroded the gross margin by 3.2 percentage points to 37.5% from a year ago. Price increases in battery and auto, elimination of prior-year Covid-19 costs and cost savings helped contain the margin erosion to some extent. Advertising and promotion expenses rose.
Adjusted profit per share in the fiscal first quarter was $1.03 compared to $1.17 last year but was ahead of estimates.
The company booked $2.75 billion in net sales last year and expects current-year sales to be roughly flat. Adjusted profit per share is seen between $3 and $3.30 compared to $3.48 last year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $575 million at midpoint of its guidance range.

The Phoenix, Arizona-based business recorded earnings per share of $1.09 on a record quarterly revenue of $1.85 billion. Analyst forecasts suggested earnings of $0.93 per share on revenue of $1.79 billion.
The company also reported a record yearly revenue of $6.74 billion for 2021, alongside a record quarterly non-GAAP operating margin of 28.6%.

(Reuters) -Hasbro Inc trounced analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Monday, bolstered by demand for toys based on the latest Spider-Man movie and a rebound in its television production business.
Still, shares reversed from premarket to trade down 2% as the company warned it expects surging freight and raw material costs to pinch profit margins for most of this year, despite another round of price increases planned for the second quarter. 
The December release of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", which has grossed more than $1.1 billion worldwide, came after Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) had struggled with a dearth of major Marvel blockbusters.
Toys based on the web slinger powered a 13% increase in the Partner Brands segment, interim Chief Executive Officer Richard Stoddart told analysts on a call.
""Spider-Man helped rebound from some of those earlier Marvel movies like 'Eternals' which underperformed,"" said James Zahn, deputy editor at trade magazine ""The Toy Book"".
""Toys for 'Shang-Chi' and 'Black Widow' also did not come out in sync with the theatrical releases, but now that's finally catching up with Spider-Man,"" he added. 
Hasbro's fourth-quarter net revenue rose 17% to $2.01 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion. The jump came despite the company falling short on its target for holiday season inventory due to global supply-chain disruptions.
To get around the bottlenecks set off by the pandemic, the company had expanded its shipping operations and advanced sourcing of products.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.21 per share, topping estimates of 88 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates, on price increases that helped offset a surge in costs.
Hasbro, which last month named the head of its digital gaming division, Chris Cocks, as its new boss, said it expects 2022 revenue to rise at a low single-digit rate.

MicroStrategy, one of the biggest corporate holders of Bitcoin, was up 10%. Stock of the only listed exchange for crypto assets was up 4.5%. The gains in the stocks follow the 5% rise in Bitcoin that took it past the $43,300-mark today. The world’s largest crypto rose above its 50-day moving average Monday for the first time in more than two months. The 50-day technical mark was around $42,810.
“Bitcoin has broken some key levels and a downward-trending line here over the past few days and is showing signs of bullishness,” but it’s “being capped by the 50-DMA and needs to close above it,” Bloomberg quoted the head of Asia-Pacific at Luno Pte, Vijay Ayyar, as saying.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The Dutch antitrust watchdog on Monday fined apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5 million euros ($5.72 million) for a third time for failing to allow software application makers in the Netherlands to use non-Apple payment methods for dating apps listed in the company's App Store.
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has been levying weekly fines of 5 million euros on Apple since the company missed a Jan. 15 deadline to make changes ordered by the watchdog.
Apple, which could not immediately be reached for comment, has twice published information on its own blog about changes it is making to comply with the Dutch order. However, the ACM said on Monday it was not receiving enough information from the U.S. company to assess whether Apple was actually complying.
""ACM is disappointed in Apple’s behaviour and actions,"" it said in a statement. It noted that Dutch courts have upheld its decision, which found that Apple's behaviour violated competition law.
Apple is under pressure in many countries over the commissions it charges on in-app purchases, with the U.S. Senate approving a bill last Thursday that would bar Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from requiring users to use their payment systems.
Apple on Jan. 15 first asserted it had complied with the Dutch regulator's December order https://www.reuters.com/technology/apples-app-store-broke-competition-laws-dutch-watchdog-says-2021-12-24 , which covers only dating apps like Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s Tinder. But the regulator responded that Apple hadn't actually yet made the changes - it had just indicated it would.
On Feb. 3, Apple made a further statement on its blog https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement, apparently laying out how developers could now implement the alternative payment methods.
One important footnote was that Apple said it would still charge a 27% commission on the in-app payments it does not process, only slightly below the 30% it currently charges. The company asserted that was ""consistent with the ACM order"". 
A spokesperson for the ACM said the agency could not comment beyond its public statements on whether a 27% commission would be consistent with its order.

Apple is separately appealing the ACM's original December decision, arguing that alternative payment systems pose a security risk to users.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Namibia aims to fast track the development of its first oilfield to have production by 2026 following a significant offshore discovery by Shell (LON:RDSa), a senior energy official told Reuters on Monday.
Shell on Friday said the exploration well off the coast of the southern African country had shown ""encouraging"" results with the presence of a working petroleum system with light oil.
""If we do this within the next four years that will be excellent for us, so as the Namibian government we have pledged our commitment to the joint venture team to walk hand-in-hand with them ... to ensure we expedite the field development so that we can produce as quickly as possible,"" Maggy Shino, petroleum commissioner at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, said in the first official comments from the government since Shell's announcement.
Shell's Graff-1 well was drilled deep offshore in water of more than 5,000 metres. 
Shino said it was too early to provide exact volumes of oil encountered at the Graff-1 well or whether the new discovery was sufficient to be a standalone project or will require further exploration in the area. 
TotalEnergies is currently drilling another well, Venus, in a nearby block.
""Give us enough time and by May, June, we be able to have enough data accessed to be able to confidently let you know about the quantity we are talking about here,"" she said.
Shell did not provide details on the size of the resource. 

Shell holds a 45% stake in Petroleum Exploration License 39 (PEL 39) where the well is located. Qatar Energy also holds a 45% interest and the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (NAMCOR) holds the remaining 10%.
In recent years interest in Namibia's offshore prospects have attracted many foreign companies including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) following discoveries in neighbouring South Africa as well as Brazil and Guyana, which share geological similarities.

The news is the latest step in what many expect to be the creation of a social media machine to power another run for the presidency by Trump in 2024.

Tyson is targeting $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 and $300 million to $400 million in fiscal 2022, relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline, according to a statement Monday.
The company is kicking off earnings for meat producers, with rising prices for beef, pork and poultry helping offset pressure from tight labor markets that have impeded production and hit supplies. Tyson has been investing to build new chicken plants and increase use of automated technology to boost output. 
“We’re pleased with the results of the first quarter and of the steps that we are taking to improve productivity,” Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said in the statement.
The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.87 a share for the fiscal first quarter, compared with $1.94 a year ago. The average of analysts’ estimate compiled by Bloomberg was $1.93. Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, compared with estimates for $12.2 billion.
For the quarter, beef prices jumped by 32% with chicken up about 20% and pork 13%.
Shares rose 3.3% before the start of regular trading in New York.
Meat companies including Tyson have been under scrutiny from the Biden Administration for the tightly concentrated industry in which a small handful of companies turn big profits while consumers pay higher food prices and farmers lose out on their share. The meat industry blames a lack of labor, high transportation costs and strong consumer demand for the upward pressure on prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp announced on Monday that it now aims to break up into two companies instead of three, while also unveiling a big boost to planned shareholder returns in an effort to appease angry investors.
Its revised plan, however, is still expected to face much pushback from foreign hedge funds, many of whom have been opposed to any kind of split and would prefer that the scandal-ridden Japanese conglomerate be taken private.
Under the new restructuring, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) will just spin off its devices business. Its previous plan had called for a three-way split - one company for devices, one for its energy and infrastructure businesses and another to house its Kioxia flash memory chip assets.
Toshiba also intends to lift shareholder returns to 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) over the next two years, up from an earlier target of 100 billion yen. Shares in the industrial conglomerate closed 1.6% higher following the news.
Sources at several shareholders told Reuters they saw the changes as simply a way for Toshiba management to skirt investor opposition. The new plan is set to seek approval from just over half of shareholders while the previous plan - which had a much larger proportion of assets being offloaded - would have required approval from two-thirds.
Toshiba argued the new plan was simpler, would save costs and would make it easier for alliances with strategic partners to be pursued.
""We have not changed the plan to avoid confrontation with shareholders,"" CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a briefing on the first of two days of meetings with investors, adding the plan would be put to a vote at an extraordinary general meeting in March.
Sources at two investors, who declined to be identified, said they believe the conglomerate would still have a hard time winning support from activist shareholders for the revised plan.
The original break-up plan was announced last November after a five-month strategic review following years of accounting scandals and governance issues that undermined investor confidence and saw Toshiba's market value more than halve, to around $18 billion, from an early 2000s peak.
Whether the conglomerate is ultimately successful in winning sufficient support for its revised plan could depend on the recommendation of influential proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services, one of the sources said. 
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP
Toshiba has had a contentious history with its foreign activist shareholders, which combined own nearly 30% of the company.
Last year a shareholder-commissioned investigation found that the conglomerate had colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholders meeting.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the government would be monitoring the progress of Toshiba's plan.
""Toshiba is a company possessing important technology including nuclear power and semiconductors that are related to national security and it is important that the businesses are maintained and developed,"" he told a briefing.
Toshiba aims to complete the spin-off and listing of its devices unit by March 2024. The unit competes with far larger rival Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies as well as Mitsubishi Electric (OTC:MIELY) Corp in power management chips which efficiently control power in cars, electronic devices and industrial equipment.
The business is expected to log 860 billion yen ($7.5 billion) in net sales and 55 billion yen in operating income in the year ending in March.
Toshiba also said on Monday that it will put its elevator and lighting businesses up for sale and added that it no longer sees Toshiba Tec Corp, which makes point-of-sale systems and copiers, as a core business.
Shares of Toshiba Tec finished up more than 14%, their biggest one-day gain in more than 20 years.
Earlier in the day, Toshiba announced it will sell almost all of its 60% stake in its air conditioning unit to its U.S. joint venture partner Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) Corp for $870 million.

Toshiba also said it continues to look at the possibility of a sale of its 40.6% stake in Kioxia Holdings, the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips, and has asked Kioxia to conduct an IPO as soon as possible.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish price comparison firm PriceRunner said on Monday it was suing Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for about 2.1 billion euros ($2.4 billion), the latest firm to take legal action alleging the search giant manipulated search results.
Google in November lost an appeal against a 2.42 billion-euro fine it received in 2017 which found using its own price comparison shopping service gave the company an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.
""They are still abusing the market to a very high extent and haven't changed basically anything,"" PriceRunner Chief Executive Mikael Lindahl told Reuters in an interview. 
PriceRunner, which is in the process of being bought by Swedish fintech Klarna, said a lawsuit it filed in Sweden aimed to make Google pay compensation for the profit it had lost in Britain since 2008, as well as in Sweden and Denmark since 2013.
A Google spokesperson said the company would defend the lawsuit in court.
""The changes we made to shopping ads back in 2017 are working successfully ... PriceRunner chose not to use shopping ads on Google, so may not have seen the same successes that others have,"" the Google spokesperson said.
Lindahl said PriceRunner was prepared to fight for many years, had secured tens of millions of euros in external financing and had steps in place in the event it did not win.
The European Commission's 2017 fine was the result of a seven-year investigation triggered by scores of complaints that Google distorted internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming rivals and consumers.
The Commission found https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1784 Google systematically gave prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service and demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results. 
""European consumers have been denied real choice in shopping services for many years and this is one step to ensuring this ends now,"" a Klarna spokesperson said.
Klarna in November agreed to buy PriceRunner from investment firm Creades for 1.06 billion Swedish crowns ($124.36 million).
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter.

Axel Springer's price comparison shopping service Idealo https://www.idealo.de/unternehmen/pressemitteilungen/idealo-suing-google-for-damages-caused-by-its-abuse-of-market-dominance then sued Google in 2019 for 500 million euros.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 09:05AM ET</span>",Traders scour markets for protection amid Ukraine tensions,"(This Feb. 4 story was refiled to change name to Garnry in 15th and 17th paragraph, clarifies designation in 15th paragraph)
By Saikat Chatterjee and Danilo Masoni
LONDON (Reuters) - Unnerved by the sabre-rattling between Russia and the West over Ukraine, traders are scouring global markets for investments that could provide them with protection against losses in case the conflict escalates.
Any conflict risks triggering a rout in riskier investments such as global stocks and a rush into so-called safe havens such as government bonds, gold and currencies like the U.S. dollar and yen, leaving those exposed to equities with large losses.
Typically, investors hedge against potential losses by buying assets that would pay out if the situation reverses, such as derivatives that could profit from a fall in stocks or commodities.
But with markets already gyrating in the face of rising inflation, worries about global growth and tighter monetary policy, the cost of that protection has gone up sharply in recent days, according to five traders.
Europe's equivalent of Wall Street's fear gauge -- an index which calculates how volatile investors expect stocks to behave in the short term -- is currently trading more than 50% above its 2021 average, indicating how increased demand is pushing hedging costs up. 
Investors are having to peer deeper and farther across markets for ideas that offer affordable protection.
In interviews, traders and investors said they are looking at a range of strategies, from derivative bets on how wildly French stocks will gyrate or how much German stocks will fall to simply looking for assets that are currently out of favour but would benefit if markets got worse.
Two traders at major global banks, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said they are recommending their clients look at the French stock market and place derivative bets on volatility, a measure of the intensity of market swings.
Their expectation is that volatility in French stocks will increase in the event of a conflict because it is one of the most liquid markets in Europe.
One of the traders, who heads derivatives strategies at a top bank in London, is recommending that his clients buy call options on French stock market volatility, which would allow them to buy the underlying financial asset at a fixed price even as it rises in the event of a conflict.
To defray some of the cost of such a bet, the trader is telling clients to sell options on U.S. stock market volatility, which he thinks is likely to be less impacted by any escalation of the conflict. Taking such a two-pronged bet would, however, also reduce some of the profits should a conflict ensue.
Swiss bank UBS is recommending buying call options on the yen or the U.S. dollar, according to a note published this week. The two currencies would likely strengthen as investors seek out safe havens in the case of a conflict, making the bets profitable.
Another suggestion from UBS is to buy put options on German stock benchmarks, a bet that will pay out if the market falls. That is a possibility because of the reliance of German companies on Russian energy for production. 
Some investors appear to be taking up that idea. A March 2022 DAX index put option, which would become profitable if the German index were to fall 10% below Wednesday's closing levels, saw record volumes on Jan. 24 and again on Wednesday.
ENDURING APPEAL OF GOLD The upfront costs of protection against what many still see as an unlikely event are leaving some investors reluctant to hedge, said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.
Investment houses like Amundi, for example, assign only a 10% probability of a full-fledged invasion.
Garnry recommends a different type of bet -- purchasing listed market-making firms like Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) and Flow Traders NV, which benefit when market volatility rises and the difference between the asking and the offering price of a security, called the bid-ask spread, increases.

Some like Sumit Kendurkar, a trader at market maker Optiver in Amsterdam say there is also interest in buying upside calls on options in energy stocks exposed to both natural gas and oil. UBS estimates that Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 20% of global gas and oil supplies. Roberto Lottici, fund manager at Banca Ifigest in Milan, has a straightforward old-school strategy of going for gold, doubling the size of gold and silver investments to 6% of his fund, while cutting put options and other hedging instruments that are becoming expensive. 
“If the situation spirals out of control,"" Lottici said, ""then it's going to be one of the very few assets that can offer protection.”

Western Union has been present in Russia for more than 30 years but the development of Russia's inter-bank payments, which offer the option of free-of-charge and instant transactions, has made the need for the money transfer service less acute.
""From April 1, 2022, Western Union terminates internal money transfers in Russia,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters.
""The company is focusing on developing the traditionally sought services of international money transfers,"" it said.
Russia's RBC daily first reported the change, citing a Western Union letter to banks that said the company was ceasing the operations due to low demand for internal Russian money transfers.

The decision comes amid the rising popularity of inter-bank transfers using a mobile phone number in Russia. 
Last week, Russia's largest lender Sberbank said it had launched money transfers to Alipay wallets in China using phone numbers, offering cross-border transfers to more than 30 countries. Other Russian banks, such as online-only Tinkoff also offer similar services.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Ortelius Advisors wants to take control of petrochemical products company Trecora Resources (NYSE:TREC)' board and has nominated six directors, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Ortelius founder Peter DeSorcy criticized how the company has previously spent capital and said there are many ways to boost Trecora's lagging share price, including ""organic, corporate finance, inorganic and strategic alternatives solutions.""
Several activist shareholders are pushing U.S. corporations ranging from retailer Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) to exercise equipment maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) to consider a sale as dealmaking is expected to remain strong this year following a record-breaking 2021.
In the letter to fellow shareholders, DeSorcy called Trecora's stock price ""consistently abysmal"" and said he did not believe the current seven board members can make the right decisions for the company.
""Incremental change - such as adding one or two new directors to the board - is woefully insufficient to reverse a culture that lacks accountability,"" DeSorcy wrote in the letter.
A Trecora representative declined to comment.
Ortelius is Trecora's biggest investor with an 11.3% stake in the Sugar Land, Texas-headquartered company. Activist investor, Bradley Radoff, a former executive at Third Point, is also a large investor in Trecora and last year made a 13D filing which often hints at a proxy battle or even an acquisition.
Ortelius nominated executives with chemical industry expertise, restructuring experience, and investment management expertise.
In the letter DeSorcy underscored Trecora's strengths, including first-class facilities and excess capacity, but said some $183 million in investments, made between 2014 and 2018, had ""no discernible impact on the company's financials.""
In 2021, Trecora's stock price gained 15% but lagged the broader Russell 3000 Index which climbed 25.6% last year. Over the last five years, Trecora's stock price has fallen 33.52%.

Facebook bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing GIFs, a type of animated image used often in social media and instant messaging, for $315 million in 2020 to integrate the operation with its Instagram photo-sharing app.
Facebook, whose parent company recently rebranded as Meta Platforms, is challenging a ruling by Britain's competition watchdog, which said it must sell Giphy because the deal would reduce competition between social media platforms and in display advertising.
Facebook said the Austrian ruling was the first time a court had reviewed the deal. The transaction is too small to be examined at a European Union level. 
""The court did not prohibit the merger provided certain conditions were met,"" the court said in a short statement on its ruling on the case brought by the Federal Competition Authority.

Those conditions included granting competitors access to Giphy's image library for five years and helping set up ""an alternative provider of a GIF library"" within seven years.
""We are pleased with (the) Austrian court's decision, which recognizes that together, Meta and Giphy would improve Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API (application programming interface) partners, providing more choices for everyone,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 08:17AM ET</span>",Federal agencies probe migrant exploitation in Alabama chicken industry,"By Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke
ENTERPRISE, Alabama (Reuters) - At least three federal agencies last year began investigating working conditions for migrants in this growing southern hub for the U.S. poultry industry, according to people familiar with the probes.
The agencies have been looking for evidence of exploitation of Hispanic migrants in the area after an unusually large number of unaccompanied minors were released from federal shelters to sponsor families here last year, these people told Reuters. 
A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services probe focused on whether minors were falling victim to traffickers exploiting them for labor, three sources familiar with the investigations said. While investigators have discovered no evidence of child trafficking, they found ""exploitative"" working conditions for some migrants, the sources added, without providing more details. 
The U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, for their part, have also investigated staffing and work conditions in the area, people familiar with those probes told Reuters. None of the probes have yet led to criminal charges or civil penalties, and it's unclear whether they will. 
Spokespeople at the three agencies declined to comment on ongoing investigations. Some details of the probes were first reported by Bloomberg Law. 
The investigations follow worries among federal employees overseeing the release of unaccompanied minors caught crossing the Mexican border into the United States. These officials were concerned by the growing number of kids headed to Enterprise, where poultry farms and processing plants offer high demand for employment. 
Reuters on Monday profiled one recently arrived Guatemalan minor who uses false identification to work at one plant near Enterprise. The teen found a job with ease, forgoing school as she races to repay debts to smugglers who got her across the U.S. border.
The U.S. government has been on heightened alert for trafficking of migrant minors into the poultry industry since 2014, when authorities discovered Guatemalan teens working without pay and living in ramshackle trailers at an Ohio egg farm.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees Homeland Security Investigations, has said under President Joe Biden that it is shifting its enforcement focus at places of work. Instead of arresting workers for immigration violations, it is targeting employers who exploit undocumented migrants.
Poultry industry workers in and around Enterprise told Reuters that migrants, including minors, easily obtain fake credentials and supply those to staffing firms who help them find work in area plants. 
The firms, they said, sometimes dock workers' pay for services, including transportation to and from the workplace, and deny them benefits like overtime pay, sick days, time off and medical coverage.
Labor law experts say large poultry processors at times have relied on staffing firms to avoid liability for hiring undocumented laborers. The staffing firms, as the direct employers, by law become responsible for vetting applicants and determining if they are allowed to work.
A previous federal investigation into the hiring of poultry workers in Alabama led to criminal convictions last October. 
The federal trial in northern Alabama illustrated abusive practices by one staffing firm there and how lucrative the migrant-recruiting business can be. The jury convicted a married couple, Deivin and Crystal Escalante, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy to transport migrants illegally. 
According to court documents and transcripts from the trial, the Escalantes supplied undocumented workers, including several minors, to a plant owned by Mar-Jac Poultry Inc. in Jasper, Alabama. 
The Escalantes pleaded not guilty and are now awaiting sentencing. They referred questions to Gregory Reid, Deivin's lawyer. Reid told Reuters that Mar-Jac contracted the couple because of their connections in the local Hispanic community. 
Mar-Jac, based in Gainesville, Georgia, hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. Linda Cox, Mar-Jac's human resources manager, said the poultry processor cooperated in the investigation and ""had a written contract with the contractor requiring lawful workers."" 

In trial testimony, Deivin Escalante said that Mar-Jac paid the couple $175 per day for each worker. The Escalantes then paid employees around $120 a day, he said. Over three years, the couple received over $16 million in revenue from Mar-Jac, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Before federal agents arrested the couple in October 2020, the Escalantes bought multiple properties and luxury cars.

The combined company is expected to have annual revenue of around $5.3 billion. Frontier Group (NASDAQ:ULCC) will own 51.5% in the combined entity, while the remaining 48.5% will be held by Spirit's shareholders. Frontier's offer of $25.83 per share is a premium of nearly 19% to the stock's Friday close of $21.73.
The combined group is expected to offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations in 19 countries, a joint press release said. The deal is expected to deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings.
The companies are hoping that bulking up will allow them to address some of the problems created by the pandemic, notably heavy debt loads and operational stresses due to staff shortages. The deal comes at a time when booking trends indicate a strong revival in the coming months.
Both the airlines also declared their fourth-quarter numbers today. Spirit’s total operating revenue nearly doubled to $988 million while adjusted loss per share more than halved to 64 cents. President and CEO Ted Christie said bookings are improving sequentially and “trends indicate travel demand in the second half of the first quarter should be quite strong.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) faced charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.
In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Swiss prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs ($45.86 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse. 
They say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.
""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. It added it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".
The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for prosecutors taking a potentially tougher stance against the country's banks. 
The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centres on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.
A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.
That banker would start testifying on Wednesday or Thursday, a preliminary court schedule showed. 
A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment. 
Banev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for money laundering. 
He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine.
Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organised criminal group for money laundering, while Romania seeks him for setting up a group for drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.
Banev's legal representative had no immediate comment.
Julius Baer, which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case. 
CASH IN CASES
The former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer, who was an associate of Banev, with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.
The customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says. 
Prosecutors allege the gang used a practice known as smurfing, whereby a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts that are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts. 
The defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made, although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering know-your-client checks after international pressure. 
The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash. 
""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""
Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.
The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.
Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.
In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.
Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but was told not to in order to avoid tipping the clients off, according to the source. 
By the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.
The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was in the hands of the court.
The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.
The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.

Julius Baer had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.

(Reuters) - New York State's top pension official has asked streaming music platform  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) for details about the effectiveness of its new content rules, citing complaints including that podcaster Joe Rogan has spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees funds that hold Spotify shares, requested the report in a letter sent to Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek on Feb. 2, which was shown to Reuters. 
The letter also urged Spotify to give users an easy mechanism to report content that could violate its rules, and to define how its board oversees content risks and enforcement.
DiNapoli cited reports of Spotify hosting content that has included COVID-19 misinformation, and racist and antisemitic material. Prominent rock musician Neil Young last month left the platform last month because he said Rogan has misled people about vaccines, followed by other stars.
""As we have seen with other technology and media companies who host or publish content, the failure to successfully moderate content on a company’s platforms can lead to various reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks,"" DiNapoli wrote.
Spotify representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
Rogan, former host of the TV reality show Fear Factor and mixed martial arts commentator who signed a $100 million deal giving Spotify exclusive rights to his podcast, has pledged more balance on his show. The company said it would add a content advisory to any episode with discussion of COVID to try to quell the controversy.
On Jan. 30 Spotify also announced ""platform rules"" against things like ""content that incites violence or hatred towards a person or group of people based on race, religion, gender identity or expression,"" and other areas.

Retirement funds overseen by DiNapoli held shares in Spotify worth $41 million as of Dec. 31, only the 73rd-largest stake in the company.
But DiNapoli has been among a group of influential activists that have successfully pushed for more content oversight at other social media companies.

The main equity indices posted healthy gains last week, boosted by generally positive corporate earnings as well as a stronger-than-expected monthly official jobs report.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain of just over 1% last week, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.4%, both indices recording their best weeks since December.
The Russell 2000 also posted its first positive week in five, but strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cautioned that tightening financial conditions, slowing economic growth and a flattening Treasury yield curve are all likely to “pressure” returns from the small-cap index relative to the S&P 500.
Friday’s jobs report saw the U.S. add 467,000 nonfarm jobs in January, much more than expected, suggesting that the largest economy in the world has weathered the winter wave of Covid-19 cases more easily than first imagined. The Federal Reserve will have taken note of this, but the main focus remains on inflation and Thursday’s consumer prices report for January.
Economists expect the CPI to rise by 0.5% on the month and 7.3% year over year, with core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) also rising 0.5% and 5.9%, respectively.
The quarterly earnings season will continue this week, although Monday is relatively quiet with only the likes of  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Loews (NYSE:L), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) due to release numbers.
Elsewhere, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) will be in the spotlight following reports that the troubled exercise equipment company is in play. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is exploring an offer, according to a report from Reuters, while the Financial Times added  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to the list of those interested in the maker of fitness equipment.
Oil prices weakened Monday, retreating from the highest levels since 2014 after the winter storm which hit large parts of the U.S. late last week didn’t result in any major disruption to Texas’ energy complex.
Oil has soared this year as the global economy has recovered from the Covid pandemic but supply has struggled to keep up with this improving demand. Increased geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia’s intentions for Ukraine have also added a risk premium to the price.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $91.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $93.04.   
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,814.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1444.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 06:41AM ET</span>","Analysis-Trump’s Truth Social app, self-proclaimed foe of Big Tech, needs Apple and Google to survive","By Julia Love and Helen Coster
(Reuters) - With just weeks to go before an expected launch, Donald Trump’s new media venture is trying to strike a delicate balance with its app: giving Trump's base the freedom to express themselves, without running afoul of Apple and Google’s app store policies.
The launch of Truth Social comes a year after the former U.S. president was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and YouTube. It will be a major test of whether Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and other tech companies that describe themselves as champions of free speech can scale alongside the Silicon Valley gatekeepers that conservatives have accused of squelching free expression.
TMTG has pledged to deliver an “engaging and censorship-free experience” on its Truth Social app, appealing to a base that feels its views around such hot-button topics in American life as vaccines and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election have been scrubbed from mainstream tech platforms. 
Yet Trump’s tech team must erect guard rails to ensure Truth Social does not get kicked out of the app stores run by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google - a fate that befell popular conservative app Parler in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riots in the U.S. Capitol. Without these stores, there is no easy way for most smartphone users to download the app.
The risk of such “de-platforming” is a top priority for TMTG Chief Executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, as his team builds the app, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Recognizing that the app will be a major target for hackers from day one, Nunes wants to have cyber talent at the “nation-state level,” one of the people said. Nunes has said publicly that the company’s goal is to launch its Truth Social app by the end of March. 
A spokesperson for TMTG did not respond to a request for comment.
TMTG remains shrouded in secrecy and is regarded with skepticism by some in tech and media circles. Two conservative media executives pointed to the venture’s apparent failure to launch a beta service in November, as planned, and cited the lack of known involvement by high-profile media, tech or political players - other than Nunes - as evidence it may be more bluster than substance. 
“No one has approached me or my team,” said one conservative media insider. “Trump has always been a bit of (his) own island.”
CONTENT MODERATION
TMTG’s mission of standing up to Big Tech is limited by its reliance on Google and Apple, which operate app stores that dominate the smartphone market. TMTG is working with Hive, a San Francisco-based company that does AI-based content moderation, to flag sexually explicit content, hate speech, bullying and violent content. That partnership is driven in part by TMTG’s desire for the Truth Social app to remain in the Apple App and Google Play stores, according to a person familiar with the venture. 
Truth Social will need robust content moderation in the form of both automated detection and in-person teams, as well as a way for users to report offensive posts, said David Thiel, the big data architect and chief technology officer of the Stanford Internet Observatory. 
“Where it is going to become difficult is if they get into a situation like with Parler, where they have such a degree of hate speech that the hosting service and potentially the App Store starts to take notice,” he said.
The Truth Social app will be subject to Apple's App Store rules that require developers to offer a way for users to report offensive content and provide ""timely responses."" The rules also bar content that ""encourages violence"" or ""depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects."" 
As of Feb. 4, TMTG had 12 job openings listed on the company website, for technical roles such as a developer to be part of the Android team and an iOS engineer. Salaries range from $80,000 to $220,000, according to the postings, which beckon candidates to work for a “well-funded,” “remote-first” and “conservative-leaning” startup. A requirement for the iOS engineer role is “knowledge of Apple’s Human  Interface  (NASDAQ:TILE) Guidelines and App Store Review Guidelines (which are more like rules).” One posting describes the ideal candidate as someone who “enjoy(s) companies that are scrappy and able to do more with less.”

Among other positions, the company is seeking to hire at least one developer with experience with Elixir, a back-end programming language, according to a job posting. 
In a Jan. 13 interview with radio host Ray Appleton, Nunes said the Palm Beach, Florida-based company will be looking for a more “permanent” location – favoring states like Florida, Tennessee and Texas over Silicon Valley. In the company’s early months, some tech talent has been working in the Atlanta area, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said Mercedes had tampered with pollution mitigation devices by installing illegal software in its vehicles, making them perform at lower levels in ordinary driving conditions than during certification tests. A total of 15 Mercedes models had such software installed, it said. 
""It is meaningful to impose sanctions against the country's No.1 imported car sales operator for obstructing consumers' rational purchase choices with false and deceptive advertisements about its emission reduction performance even after the Dieselgate scandal,"" the KFTC said in a statement. 
The German carmaker also falsely advertised that their vehicles' emissions remained at a minimum level and met the Euro 6 emission standards between August 2013 and December 2016, according to the KFTC. 
Mercedes was not immediately available for comment outside business hours when contacted by Reuters. 

Last year, the KFTC imposed a fine or ordered corrective actions for Audi-Volkswagen Korea, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Corp, Stellantis Korea and Porsche AG for similar emissions rigging incidents.

The $23 billion fund was one of 14 investors that called on Wizz in December to allow employees to form and join trade unions, saying their research suggested it was discouraging the practice in breach of staff rights.
AkademikerPension said on Monday that, after meeting management, it saw no sign the airline's practices would change, and so it had begun to divest its holding, worth more than $3 million. The market value of London-listed Wizz Air is around $5.8 billion.
The fund said it had sold the shares it directly held in Wizz Air on Feb. 1, and had given its external fund managers until Feb. 8 to do the same.
""After engaging with the company's management, we are in no way reassured that they will initiate the changes we have requested with regard to human and labour rights issues,"" said AkademikerPension Chief Executive Jens Munch Holst.
Responding to the fund's criticism of labour rights at the airline, a spokesperson for Wizz Air said sustainability was a core value for the company, citing its top ranking among European airlines according to such criteria from data provider Sustainalytics. 
""Wizz Air takes the engagement with its employees very seriously and we are confident that our structures and processes that have been in place to support open and transparent engagement are working extremely well, including our People Council, which provides a forum for employees to discuss important issues,"" the airline said in a statement. 
As airlines continue to recover from the impact of the Covid pandemic, Wizz Air noted its plan to hire more than 1,000 staff in the coming months and said it had restored the pay of cabin crew and staff to pre-pandemic levels.
The move by AkademikerPension followed an investigation in which it found multiple instances where the company had refused to recognise the rights of staff to form a trade union.

In their December letter, the 14 investors and potential investors, which also included Britain's Ardevora Asset Management, quoted an interview with Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi in which he said the company kept out unions as they were ""killing the business"".

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) traded 3.8% lower in premarket Monday as the company’s registration of a large number of American depositary shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday indicates that a big shareholder, most likely Softbank (T:9984), is preparing a block sale.
According to the filing last week, the Chinese internet giant applied for registration of an additional 1 billion ADSs, each representing eight ordinary shares.
SoftBank invested in Alibaba before its initial public offering. A large portion of its holdings in the company are thus not registered as ADSs,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts wrote in a note.
The Alibaba filing with the SEC will allow the company’s stockholders whose weren’t registered with the SEC the option to sell the shares, Citi said. The registration could also cover the company’s need to issue new shares for the employee equity incentive plan, according to Bloomberg.
SoftBank owns 5.39 billion Alibaba shares, equivalent to 673.76 million ADSs, or a 24.8% stake, according to calculations by Citi analysts. Alibaba registered about 2 billion ADSs when the company conducted its IPO in the U.S. in 2014, Bloomberg said.
SoftBank reports earnings Tuesday. It has used buybacks to bolster its own stock. Alibaba is by far its most valuable holding.
The Japanese investment firm has seen the value of its portfolio companies fall significantly amid the tech meltdown of the last few months. These include Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI),  One 97 Communications  (NS:PAYT) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). Didi trades at less than a quarter of its IPO price while One 97 has more than halved in less than three months since its public debut.

Neither the Federal Reserve nor the European Central Bank will move further into hawkish territory, “at least relative to what is priced in currently,” strategists led by Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. Meanwhile, headline inflation is peaking and earnings are likely to surprise positively. “We believe that equities still offer upside, and that the cycle is far from over,” they said.
U.S. and European stocks started the year on the wrong foot amid fears that more aggressive monetary tightening to tame inflation will lead to a sharp slowdown in economic growth. While a solid earnings seasons is helping to alleviate some concerns over a less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop, equity markets have remained volatile, and strategists are divided about the outlook for the rest of the year.
“We think it is wrong to position for a recession, given still extremely favorable financing conditions,” very strong labor markets, strong corporate cash flows and the likely bottoming of economic growth in China, JPMorgan’s team wrote.
By contrast, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson today reiterated that “winter is here,” for stocks.
“Earnings risk is increasing for a wider swath of the market than most investors expect as rising inventories meet waning demand,” strategists led by Wilson wrote in a note. They listed the earnings disappointments of pandemic market darlings including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) Inc. and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc. as examples of the “payback for last year’s over consumption.”
While Wilson recommends investors position defensively for more downside, JPMorgan’s team says investors should follow the opposite strategy, with an underweight position on traditional defensive sectors such as real estate, consumer staples and health care stocks.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Toshiba stock (T:6502) closed 1.6% higher in Tokyo after dropping its previous plan to split into three and instead go for a two-way division to pacify foreign investors.
Under the revised plan, it will spin off its electronic devices and storage solutions by March 2024. The parent company will keep the energy systems and solutions business including digital battery operations as well as its stake in flash-memory company Kioxia Holdings.
It is also exiting non-core businesses. This includes selling its 55% stake in an air-conditioner venture to its partner Carrier for about $868 million. It also plans to divest its elevator and lighting businesses.
The previous plan called for the separation of the company into three units -- one for infrastructure, a second comprising electronic devices and a third holding the Kioxia stake and other assets.
That plan ran into a lot of resistance, particularly from foreign investors who accumulated big stakes after the accounting scandal that hit the company in 2015.
Last month, shareholder, Singapore’s 3D Investment Partners, called the plan “the result of a flawed process” that failed to address the company’s underlying issues. It said Toshiba should only proceed with its separation plan if two-thirds of shareholders express support. It asked Toshiba’s strategic-review committee to consider alternatives, including selling the whole company to a private investor.
According to a January 18 letter by another investor, Farallon Capital Management, “the core issue afflicting Toshiba is the lack of trust between management and its shareholders, resulting in four years of prolonged conflict”."

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Peloton Interactive stock (NASDAQ:PTON) surged 23% in premarket trading Monday on reports that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) are both interested in buying the troubled company.
Amazon is exploring an offer for Peloton and is speaking with advisers about whether and how to proceed, a Reuters report said Friday. The same day, a report by the Financial Times added Nike to the list of those interested in the maker of fitness equipment.
The reports come amid turbulence at the company that has seen it lose as much as 84% from its high last year, when it was valued at $50 billion. Peloton was among the biggest winners of the pandemic when at-home people used its equipment to keep fit. As the economy reopened, those people returned to gyms and going outdoors. Sales of its treadmills and bikes fell. It swung to a net loss three quarters ago and its loss has widened in each subsequent quarter since then.
The company cut some product prices but that has blurred the image it initially pushed of being a maker of high-end items. Catering to a mass market remains a work-in-progress. The company has also announced plans to cut costs, and according to a Bloomberg report, isn’t ruling out job cuts.
Meanwhile, activist investor Blackwells Capital is pushing for changes at Peloton, including the replacement of CEO John Foley. The investment firm, run by Jason Aintabi, is urging Peloton to sell itself to a company like  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) or Nike (NYSE:NKE), according to a separate report by Reuters."

The New York-based company is working with an adviser after a plunge in the shares made it a takeover target, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. The takeover interest is exploratory and may not lead to a transaction, they said.
The stock rose 27% in early premarket trading in New York.
Peloton’s stock has fallen more than 80% from the high a year ago as the gradual easing of pandemic restrictions fueled concern that growth would slow. It’s currently valued at just over $8 billion, based on Friday’s official market close of $24.60 a share -- below its September 2019 initial public offering price of $29 a share.
The stock could see more gains at the New York open due to high short interest. A 12% short position on its free float could mean short sellers would scramble to cover their positions, fueling shares further higher.
Activist investor Blackwells Capital LLC last month issued a letter demanding the company fire co-founder and Chief Executive Officer John Foley and pursue a sale. Blackwells said in the letter that potential buyers could include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co., and  Nike  .

""In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, we once again benefited from the very good market conditions, both for sulfuric acid and in the markets for the industrial metals copper, tin, nickel, and zinc,"" Chief Executive Officer Roland Harings said. 
""This was reinforced by the very good operating performance from our plants at the sites of the Aurubis smelter network."" 
Aurubis said it expects an increasing supply of copper concentrates (ore) in 2022 with higher treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) and good supplies of scrap metal.
Miners pay TC/RCs to smelters to process concentrate into refined metal. Benchmark TC/RCs for 2022 have risen about 9% on the year, Aurubis said.
""The spot (TC/RC) price is currently at benchmark level,"" Aurubis said. ""Thanks to our core expertise in processing complex concentrates, we expect Aurubis to achieve TC/RCs above the benchmark.""
Demand for copper products is expected to continue growing this year, with a higher premium for metal sales.
Copper wire rod demand continues to be positive in Europe and elsewhere.
""Aurubis continues to expect high demand from the electrical industry, the automotive industry, and the construction and infrastructure sector in calendar year 2022,"" it said. ""Demand for shapes is expected to be at a high level in the coming fiscal year as well.""
In May or June, Aurubis will undertake a planned maintenance shutdown at its largest smelter in Hamburg, but smelter availabilty will be overall up on the year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) said on Monday it now aims to split into two companies instead of three, while boosting planned shareholder returns to appease angry investors.
The once-storied conglomerate has been battered by accounting scandals, massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business, the sale of its prized chip unit and it was also found to have colluded to prevent overseas investors from gaining influence. Here is a timeline of Toshiba' woes since 2015.
2015 - Toshiba discloses accounting malpractices across multiple divisions, which involved top management. In total, it overstated its pretax profit by 230 billion yen ($2 billion) over seven years.
Dec. 2016 - Toshiba flags it will take a charge of several billion dollars in relation to a nuclear power plant construction company that its U.S. unit, Westinghouse Electric, had bought a year earlier.
March 2017 - Westinghouse files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to billions of dollars in cost overruns and years-long delays at U.S. power projects. Faced with over $6 billion in liabilities linked to Westinghouse, Toshiba decides to put its prized chip unit, Toshiba Memory, up for sale.
Sept. 2017 - Toshiba agrees to sell the chip unit to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion, a deal under which Toshiba retains a large stake. Worried it could be delisted for having liabilities exceed assets for a second straight year, Toshiba is desperate to close the deal by the end of the financial year in March. But it is caught up in a prolonged dispute with chip joint venture partner  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) over the sale and antitrust reviews are expected to take months.
Dec. 2017 - Toshiba secures a $5.4 billion cash injection from 30-plus overseas investors that helps it avoid a delisting but brings in prominent activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point and Farallon. It settles the dispute with Western Digital.
June 2018 - Toshiba completes the sale of Toshiba Memory, renamed Kioxia, to the Bain consortium.
Jan. 2020 - Toshiba finds fresh accounting irregularities at a wholly owned subsidiary.
July 2020 - Five director candidates nominated by activist shareholders seeking to improve governance and change strategy are voted down at Toshiba's annual general meeting.
Sept. 2020 - Toshiba discloses more than 1,000 postal voting forms for its AGM went uncounted. The bank that counted the votes, Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank, later reveals widespread failure to count all valid votes at AGMs of its client firms over the past two decades.
March 2021 - Shareholders approve an independent investigation into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of the previous year's AGM.
April 2021 - CVC Capital Partners makes an unsolicited $21 billion offer to take Toshiba private. A week later, Toshiba's CEO resigns amid controversy over the CVC bid, which was perceived by some within company management as designed to shield him from activist shareholders. Toshiba's subsequent dismissal of the CVC offer, however, angers some activist shareholders.
June 10, 2021 - The shareholder-commissioned investigation concludes Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees Toshiba as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at the 2020 shareholder meeting.
June 25, 2021 - Shareholders oust board chairman Osamu Nagayama after critics accuse the board of failing to address the allegations about pressuring overseas investors. Toshiba pledges to undertake a full review of assets and engage with potential investors.

Nov 2021 - Toshiba says it will split into three companies with one unit focused on energy, another on infrastructure and the third managing its stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia.

The central bank issued the two-year punishment to Deutsche following a case where it said foreign banks helped grain companies engage in currency speculation through deliverable forwards, affecting the stability of Taiwan's foreign exchange market.
The Taiwan dollar has strengthened against the U.S. dollar as the island's trade-dependent economy boomed on global demand for its tech products fuelled by people working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Three sources briefed on the matter told Reuters the central bank had quietly allowed Deutsche Bank to resume the forwards trading. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment, while Taiwan's central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
One of the sources said the move was based on the bank cooperating on ""improvement measures"", and because not only is it the only German bank in Taiwan, it has also operated on the island for many years.
A second source said the bank had responded to ""motivation"" to fix its processes.
Last July, the central bank lifted related foreign exchange trading curbs early on ING and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) for their involvement in the same case.

The central bank has been concerned that the strong Taiwan dollar could make exports from the trade-dependent island more expensive and possibly put it in the crosshairs of the United States as a currency manipulator.
Taiwan, along with Vietnam, again exceeded the U.S. Treasury's thresholds for possible currency manipulation and enhanced analysis under a 2015 trade law, but the department in December refrained from formally branding them as manipulators.

The move to bring in-house a multi-million business, which is key for many fashion houses but often managed through licensing, is the first by an Italian luxury group.
""We are thinking of a business model which could see tie-ups and partnerships with our producers,"" Dolce told Corriere della Sera's L'Economia financial weekly. 
He added that the move was part of a ""long-term strategy which sees us committed to consolidating, cultivating and promoting Italian artisanal and manufacturing excellence.""
Fashion brands have always branched out into high-end beauty products in a bid to diversify their products and widen their customer base. 
A licensing agreement with Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido terminated in December. 
The new company will kick off with a capital of between 200-250 million euros ($514.44 million), through self-financing and ""support from the banking system"", Dolce said. 
It will employ some 130-150 people in Italy by March 2023 and a further 100-120 abroad. 
Dolce will be president and former LVMH executive Gianluca Toniolo will be CEO. 
Toniolo told L'Economia the retail value of Dolce&Gabbana's beauty business was worth just over 1 billion euros, with perfumes accounting for the majority. 

He added that the goal of the new company was ""double, if not triple"" its market share in the perfume sector, to strengthen its position in make up and develop skincare products, which the group still does not have.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>","U.S. stock market liquidity 'abysmal,' adding to volatility risk","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Liquidity in U.S. stocks has fallen to levels last seen during the COVID-19 selloff two years ago, adding to volatility in an already-nervous market.
Market liquidity, or how easily investors can buy or sell a security without affecting its price, has been on a downward spiral for years. In recent weeks, however, traders have been whipsawed by massive moves.
""Liquidity is abysmal, is the way I would describe it,"" said Rishabh Bhandari, senior portfolio manager at alternative investment management firm Capstone Investment Advisors.
""As soon as anyone wants to move risk, there isn't an efficient mechanism for folks to be able to do so.""
Analysts said liquidity has been hurt as active investors who buy and sell opportunistically have been overshadowed by automated trading and passive investment strategies. They also blamed tighter regulations that have discouraged risk-taking by some brokers.
On Thursday, for instance, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms plunged in the biggest daily slide ever for a U.S. company stock, losing more than $200 billion of market value.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index rose last month to a 15-month high of 38.94, amid a plunge in stock prices that left the Nasdaq down 9% and the S&P off 5.3% in January in the face of a hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve.
The liquidity problem is not restricted to individual stocks. E-mini S&P 500 futures, one the world's most widely followed financial instruments, are also flashing a danger sign.
Low liquidity exacerbates market swings and makes it harder for investors to execute buy and sell orders at a desired price. Episodes of scant liquidity contributed to wild market gyrations in March 2020, when the S&P 500 fell by about a third, peak-to trough, as investors worried about an economic shutdown related to COVID-19.
One measure of equity market liquidity is the market depth of S&P 500 e-mini futures, which investors use to gain exposure to the U.S. stock market.
These futures trade usually about $50 million of notional value at any given time. That number fell to around $2 million in late January, not far from the $1 million - to $1.5 million level touched in March 2020, data from Capstone showed. Now it stands at just under $5 million.
(Graphic: Liquidity crisis, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/LIQUIDITY/znpnejlybvl/chart.png)
Another liquidity metric shows the share of equity exchange traded funds as a percentage of total equity volumes at 45%, the highest in at least two years. Low liquidity in individual stocks has pushed investors to increase their use of equity ETFs, according to JP Morgan.
In addition to the March 2020 selloff, deteriorating market liquidity contributed to equity market corrections in September 2021 and October 2020 and December 2018, JP Morgan analysts said in a recent note.
""A similarly abrupt deterioration in equity market liquidity conditions appears to have exacerbated recent market moves,"" they wrote.
Investors pinned the dearth of liquidity on a variety of factors. For one, they said tighter regulations in the aftermath of the global financial crisis curtailed large broker-dealers' capacity to take risk. 
Another factor has been the shift to market making for securities from humans to machines. Trading programs sometimes pull back liquidity when volatility spikes, experts said, which can exacerbate market moves.
Also, some investors cited the rise of passive investment strategies. While active managers looking for trading opportunities have historically provided liquidity during times of stress, systematic and passive strategies may not be allowed to do so due to strict rules about how and when they can trade.

""Liquidity risk is grossly under-appreciated,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) and a former options market maker. 
""As investors crowd into winning stocks, they become oblivious to the fact that it becomes increasingly difficult to exit en masse.”

Investing.com -- European stock markets edged higher Monday, in calm trading  after the volatility generated last week by a strong U.S. jobs report and the European Central Bank’s hawkish turn.
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%.
Investors have started the new week in a contemplative mood, as they digest Friday’s strong U.S. payrolls report as well the potential for rising interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
The increase of 467,000 jobs in Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, as well as over 700,000 in revisions from the previous two months, means markets are now pricing in a one-in-three chance that the Fed lifts interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in March.
Back in Europe, Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank president and a member of the ECB's Governing Council, said on Sunday that he expects the ECB to raise interest rates in the fourth quarter of this year, following on from President Christine Lagarde noting increased concern over inflation levels after Thursday’s meeting.
Adding to the uncertainty is the crisis on the Ukrainian border, with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warning on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an attack within days or weeks, as diplomatic efforts to find a way out of the situation continue with French President Emmanuel Macron heading to Moscow.
Elsewhere, German industrial production dipped in December, falling by 0.3% on the month, as supply chain bottlenecks and a drop in construction hampered Europe's largest economy.
The earnings season continues this week but is relatively quiet Monday. Aurubis (DE:NAFG) stock rose 3.1% after Europe’s largest copper producer recorded a rise of about 85% in quarterly profits as high metal prices boosted results.
 Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT) stock rose 0.7% after Bloomberg News reported that the consumer goods giant was considering the sale of its baby-food business.
Oil prices weakened Monday, consolidating after surging to the highest levels since 2014 at the end of last week, recording its seventh consecutive weekly gain.
Oil has soared this year as the global economy has recovered from the Covid pandemic but supply has struggled to keep up with this improving demand, putting $100 a barrel within reach. Increased geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia’s intentions for Ukraine have also added a risk premium to the price.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $91.26 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $92.65.   
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,812.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1430.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 12:30AM ET</span>",Column-Rio's dreadful workplace report may boost cost of energy transition: Russell,"By Clyde Russell
LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s decision to go public with a self-damning report into its workplace culture should be a watershed moment for a wider mining industry aiming to be seen as the ""good guys"", helping to drive the world's energy transition.
It was no doubt a courageous decision by Rio, the world's biggest miner of iron ore and a top copper producer, to release a report that makes extremely uncomfortable reading, unveiling a culture riddled with sexual harassment, bullying and racism.
But the big question for Rio, and its peers such as BHP Group (NYSE:BHP),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) and Vale, is what the industry does to tackle the issues, and how will it build a future workforce that sees itself as being proud to part of the solution to climate change.
And the issue for the wider commodities markets is that no matter how the miners respond, the likelihood is that any solution will be costly, eventually feeding into the prices of metals such as copper, lithium and nickel, all vital for the renewable energies needed to reach net-zero carbon emissions.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm called the Feb. 1 report ""disturbing,"" and pledged to implement all 26 recommendations by former Australian sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick.
The report showed that nearly half of all employees who responded to the external review of workplace culture had been bullied, while nearly 30% of women and about 7% of men experienced sexual harassment, with 21 women reporting actual or attempted rape and sexual assault.
It is obvious that the short-term implication is going to be an intense focus on improving Rio's workplace culture, especially at remote mine sites such as the Pilbara part of Western Australia state, home to the company's major iron ore mines.
But the longer-term implications are likely to be more profound.
It would be reasonable to assume that the issues raised are not limited to just Rio, and that the mining industry in general suffers the same problems.
This means that the chief executives of Rio's peers and competitors are probably already scrambling to see just how out of order their own houses are, and develop action plans to change their own workplace problems.
The issue is now firmly on the radar screens of investors, with pointed questions likely to flow at shareholder meetings.
How the industry is seen to respond will be vital, and there is little doubt the Rio report is a hammer blow to its image.
This could not have come at a worse time, as mining companies try desperately to attract young people into the industry.
LABOUR THE KEY
A simple internet search for ""lack of mining engineering students"" throws up a plethora of articles, stretching back several years, but becoming more prevalent in recent times.
One such article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from August last year highlighted the steps mining companies are prepared to take, including offering free bar tabs to students at the School of Mines in Western Australia.
One student said he had six job offers and eventually settled for a position paying more than A$110,000 ($78,100) a year for a eight-day on, six-day off roster with a gold mining company. 
This starting salary compares to the median annual income of A$83,000 for an Australian with a post-graduate degree in 2020.
In other words, mining companies are have to pay handsomely to get the few students are available.
Yes, they can put more money into scholarships and pay even bigger salaries, but ultimately young graduates are going to go to work for companies with a culture and mission they can identify with.
This is the biggest challenge for mining companies, convincing potential employees that they are employers of choice and an integral part of the march towards global net-zero carbon emissions.
A recent report by the International Energy Agency estimated that meeting the targets of the Paris climate accord will require, over the next two decades, that clean energy's share of metal demand rise to more than 40% for copper and rare earth elements, 60% to 70% for nickel and cobalt, and almost 90% for lithium.
This implies the mining industry is going to have to ramp up its activities considerably in coming years, and it is likely that labour shortages will climb the list of top concerns for chief executives.

The questions for the industry, and for the wider community driving the energy transition, is what will be the cost of attracting workers to mining, how can it be done, and what happens if the industry continues to fall short in creating workplaces of choice?

(Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on Sunday he ""strongly"" condemns racial slurs and other comments made by popular U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan but will not be removing him from the platform.
Ek's comments, sent in a letter to staff seen by Reuters, come on the heels of Rogan issuing an apology for the second time in a week, the latest for using racial slurs after a montage video surfaced showing him repeatedly using the N-word.
Ek said it was Rogan's decision to remove a number of past episodes from ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, following discussions with the music streaming platform and his own reflections on some of the content in the show, including the usage of racially insensitive language.
""While I strongly condemn what Joe has said... I want to make one point very clear – I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer,"" Ek said.
Ek reiterated his stand on Spotify's content moderation policies and said that he believes the company should have clear boundaries around the content being published. The company should take actions when they are crossed, but he cautioned that canceling voices is a slippery slope.
The company will also commit $100 million for the licensing, development, and marketing of music and audio content from historically marginalized groups, in a bid to elevate creators from a diversity of backgrounds, according to the letter, which was confirmed by a Spotify spokesperson.
In his apology, Rogan had said the montage showed him using the epithet in conversations on shows over the last 12 years, and included examples of him discussing its use by Black and white comedians and others.
A mixed martial arts commentator and a prominent vaccine skeptic, Rogan has courted controversy with his views on COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic and government mandates to control the spread of the virus.

Prominent singer-songwriters including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell said that they were removing their music from Spotify in protest at coronavirus misinformation broadcast on the platform.
The backlash against COVID-19 misinformation on the streaming service wiped more than $2 billion off its market value last week. Spotify has said it would add a ""content advisory"" to any episode with discussion of COVID-19.

The CSI 300 Index, which fell into a bear market just before the Lunar New Year holidays, rallied as much as 2.4% in early trading. The Shanghai Composite Index also rose. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index edged up 0.2% after adding nearly 3% on Friday in its first session post the break. 
Chinese stocks had their worst January performance in years as worries about a weak economy and the property sector’s debt woes outweighed Beijing’s monetary easing. While global equities advanced when China was shut, stocks on the mainland may struggle to keep up with any initial upward momentum given their weakening correlation with offshore markets, unless policymakers take more steps to restore investor confidence.
China markets can “catch up to the moves over the past week in offshore China equities,” said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Markets will be looking for more easing post Lunar New Year to support liquidity.”
How China’s central bank will manage liquidity after its customary pre-holiday pump priming will also offer clues. The monetary policy divergence between Beijing and Washington -- touted as one key reason for global brokerages to turn bullish on Chinese equities -- hasn’t yet led to any meaningful gains, with last month’s cut to a key interest rate failing to excite local traders.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2022 08:56PM ET</span>",Analysis-Singapore bets on niche SPAC listings to capture tech boom,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - After years of struggling to emerge from the shadows of regional rivals, Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) is looking to establish itself as the hub for blank-cheque firms, riding on regulatory overhaul, support by state firms, and a tech boom in its back yard.
    Encouraged by the flurry of Southeast Asian tech start-ups seeking funding and the bourse's revised rules, Singapore could list up to a dozen special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) within the next 12-18 months, bankers, venture capitalists, and analysts say.
    A key test for SGX will come when such companies, also known as blank-cheque or shell firms, have to seal merger targets within two years, a ""de-SPACing"" process already weighing on U.S. deals as hundreds of SPACS chase targets.
Analysts say Singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk-averse investors interested in a new asset class, especially after SGX has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market.
In contrast, large international institutions have turned to Hong Kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade.
While a craze in SPACs has fizzled out in the United States since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns, SGX hosted three SPACs last month in their first major debut in Asia. The attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an IPO.
""Looking at the response for the first SPACs, the pipeline is very strong,"" said Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, capital markets head at DBS, joint issue manager on two SPAC IPOs with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Singapore SPACs are likely to chase targets in fintech, tech and consumer sectors, bankers say. Valuations of targets could range between S$800 million ($596 million) to up to S$2 billion, with dealmaking likely as early as this year.
""The size of the opportunity, of younger companies scaling up and going for listings, is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it'll be multiples of those,"" said Ashish Wadhwani, a Singapore-based managing partner at IvyCap Ventures, an Indian firm managing about $400 million of assets.
Last year, fundraising on SGX halved to $565 million, a six-year low, with just eight listings, Refinitiv data shows.
Underlying Singapore's cautious approach, state investor Temasek-linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three SPACs, all of which were oversubscribed.
Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Venture Holdings, a Temasek subsidiary, and one of Southeast Asia's largest funds, was the first to launch a S$200 million tech SPAC in January.
CAUTIOUS START
""I expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes. I don't think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come,"" said Chua Kee Lock, CEO of Vertex, which manages $5.1 billion of assets.
Backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund Novo Tellus' S$150 million SPAC included a Temasek unit.
European asset manager Tikehau Capital, which has two Europe-listed SPACs, also chose Singapore for a S$170 million SPAC listing, with co-sponsors including LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.
The latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in Singapore, which is already a leading Asian finance and wealth hub.
""It's a chicken-and-egg situation. Maybe if you create this SPAC market, then more investors will come,"" Wadhwani said.
SPACs typically offer stock with warrants, which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors.
Still, for wealthy investors such as Prantik Mazumdar, the listing of big regional names in Singapore and successful business mergers of SPACS are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre-IPO U.S. tech companies.
""Unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that SPACs offer, I'm probably on the fence,"" Mazumdar said.
In 2010, SGX deliberated on SPACs but didn't get favourable market feedback. Last year, it launched a SPAC framework, with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors. It required them to invest in their SPACs and unlike in Hong Kong, SGX allowed participation from retail investors.
""A SPAC listing can definitely help a start-up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle,"" said Chandra Tjan, co-founder of Indonesia-focussed Alpha JWC Ventures.
Last year, Singapore also announced two funds with S$2 billion in capital for late-stage funding and IPOs as dealmaking surges.
Twenty private companies in Southeast Asia joined the ranks of those valued at $1 billion or more in 2021, while 53 firms joined the list of those with near-term potential of being valued at $1 billion, data from research firm Tracxn shows.
""Fundamentally, the benchmark to be a sponsor in Singapore is higher, between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de-SPAC,"" said Neil Parekh, CEO of Pegasus Asia, the Tikehau-backed Singapore SPAC.
Singapore's success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts (REITs) could be a template to build a SPAC market.

""Singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy SPACs market, and it can develop in the same way as the REIT market if we keep a close watch over the quality of sponsors and maintain overall listing standards,"" said Mohamed Nasser Ismail, SGX's head of equity capital markets.

The Chinese-owned mine has been a flashpoint of protests and road blockades since it started functioning in 2016, with operations last suspended in December due to a similar blockade. 
Despite an agreement being reached in December to restart operations, leaders of a group of Peruvian communities later rejected a government proposal to prevent future blockades. 
The Chumbivilcas communities - mostly indigenous citizens of Quechua descent - have repeatedly accused the Chinese company of failing to provide jobs and money to the region, one of the poorest in Peru, despite the vast mineral wealth.
In the latest development, MMG said the local community had erected a new blockade of around 100 kilometres from the copper mine.

""Due to the restrictions to both inbound and outbound transportation, Las Bambas has been forced to progressively reduce mine operations,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it was working with the government and community to deliver the December agreement. 
The miner said production will be halted circa Feb. 20 if the roadblock does not end.

(Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group on Monday joined rival Westpac in flagging lower margins and warned of a first-half hit from ""softer"" performance in its markets business, sending its shares to a near one-year low.
ANZ did not disclose a profit figure for the quarter and said group net interest margin declined by 8 basis points, but added that rising interest rates in New Zealand would relieve some pressure in the second quarter.
Australian lenders are battling squeezing margins in the face of steep competition in mortgage lending, spurred by record low interest rates in Australia through the COVID-19 pandemic. Westpac warned on its margins last week.
ANZ said ""softer"" revenue in its markets business in October would hit first-half results, even though the unit's performance in subsequent months was in line with trends seen over fiscal 2021.
While it reversed A$44 million ($31.2 million) in bad debt provisions during the quarter, changes to provide Australian retail and commercial customers lower fee options would reduce annual operating income by about A$140 million, it added.
""Given the uncertain impacts of reduced activity on asset quality going forward, we expect that the bad debt benefit will likely be looked through and investors will focus on the softer than expected revenue print,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
ANZ shares sank as much as 5% to A$25.73, its lowest since Feb. 17, 2021, while the broader market was 0.7% lower.
In the Australian home loan space, ANZ said it had made ""solid progress"" to improve its systems, with application times for simple loans now in line with other major lenders.
The bank, which has steadily lost Australian home loan market share since 2019, said in October it aims to grow its home loan book in line with its larger peers by the end of the current business year.

ANZ also said it would consider expanding its A$1.5 billion buyback, as it reported a common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11.6% as at Dec. 31.

New home sales in the United States, which makes up 70% of the company's revenue, rose in every month of the December quarter and are expected to be robust despite the prospect of higher mortgage rates, driving up demand for building materials.
That is likely to support the company's prospects, even as it looks for a new chief executive after firing Jack Truong last month over claims of misconduct and complaints about his management style. Truong has rejected the claims.
The Dublin-based firm said it now expects adjusted net income between $620 million and $630 million for fiscal 2022, up from its earlier forecast of $605 million to $625 million.
For fiscal 2023, it forecast adjusted profit of between $740 million to $820 million.

It also posted adjusted net income of $154.1 million in the December quarter, up from $123.3 million a year ago.
Quarterly net sales were $900 million, up 22% from last year, with its North America segment contributing $644.9 million.

""The volatile situation will affect us at least beyond the first half of this year,"" Murat Aksel, the head of procurement on the Volkswagen board said in an interview with Automobilwoche.
Carmakers around the world have been hit by a shortage of semiconductors caused by COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions as well as soaring semiconductor demand at consumer electronic companies.
Aksel said there were clearly structural issues at play, with demand set to continue to rise in the car making industry.

As such, instead of looking at claiming damages from suppliers behind on chip deliveries, the focus was on working closely with them to ensure better availability, he said.
It should become easier to make reliable predictions in 2023, when more semiconductor production capacity comes online, he said.

""When I look at the current orders, I'm confident for 2022. Growth in sales could reach a similarly high level this year as in 2021,"" Detlev von Platen said in an interview with the magazine.
Sales at Porsche, part of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), rose 11% last year to 301,915 which would mean they could reach more than 335,000 this year if growth maintains the same pace.
Van Platen said Porsche wanted to hire 400 more workers. The carmaker has a workforce of nearly 40,000.
The high demand was leading to longer delivery times, he said.

""Wait times can last several months, in some cases up to a year,"" von Platen said.

GlobalWafers said in a statement it expected total capital expenditure to reach T$100 billion ($3.6 billion) between 2022 and 2024, including ""substantial greenfield investments"".
The proceeds originally intended for the Siltronic acquisition were now earmarked for capital and operating expenses, it added.
""While the failed completion of our offer for Siltronic is disappointing we have pursued a dual-track strategy from the very beginning of the tender offer,"" said CEO Doris Hsu. ""I am very excited that we can consider now a broad range of options to advance technology development and enhance our capacities.""
The expansion plan includes investments in Asia, Europe and the United States, the company said.
The new production lines are expected to ramp up in the second half of next year, and be expanded quarterly, it said.
Hsu declined to give details, citing confidentiality.
The failed acquisition comes as a global shortage of semiconductors has laid bare Europe's dependence on Asian suppliers, which has triggered recent efforts to boost production across the continent.
Germany's Economy Ministry said it was not possible to complete all the steps of the investment review, in particular a review of an antitrust approval granted by China only last month.
On Jan. 21, China's market regulator said it would give conditional approval for the acquisition.
Hsu told reporters the deal lapsed because China's decision had come too late for Germany to consider, but declined to comment on whether they would continue to talk to the German government about the issue.
""Everyone is guessing. The official word we received was that there was not enough time,"" she said when asked whether other factors like protectionism were at play in the failure of the deal.
Siltronic's majority shareholder Wacker Chemie, which owns a 30.83% stake in Siltronic, has said it regretted the economy ministry's decision, adding it still intended to sell its remaining stake in Siltronic in the medium-term.
The deal would have created the second-largest maker of 300-millimetre wafers, behind Japan's Shin-Etsu, as the semiconductor industry consolidates.
Germany has become wary of changes to its high-tech supply network after carmakers, one of its major sectors, were hit by the global chip shortage.
A recent takeover of a European semiconductor company by an Asian buyer that did go through was the purchase of Dialog Semiconductor by Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp.
GlobalWafers secured a majority stake in Siltronic last year and initially hoped to have the transaction wrapped up in late 2021.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2022 08:31PM ET</span>",NBC's Olympics opening ceremony coverage draws nearly 14 million U.S. TV viewers,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) -NBC's coverage of the opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympic Games averaged close to 14 million U.S. television viewers, according to preliminary data provided by NBCUniversal on Saturday, about half the TV audience for the last Winter Games opening ceremony four years ago.Across all platforms, including the USA Network, NBC Sports app and Peacock streaming service, NBC's average audience reached nearly 16 million people, the company said in an email.
The opening ceremony for the 2021 Tokyo Summer Games, which historically attracts a bigger audience than the Winter Games, drew 16.7 million TV viewers. Across all platforms, 17 million people watched the ceremony.
Traditional TV viewing has seen a decline in recent years as viewers have embraced streaming, making comparisons difficult.
The 14 million figure includes the TV audience for the live NBC broadcast that began at 6:30 a.m. ET (1130 GMT) Friday, as well as the primetime broadcast that began at 8 p.m. ET. The PyeongChang opening ceremony in 2018, in South Korea, drew 27.9 million TV viewers for just a primetime broadcast.
The Games opened on Friday night in a snow- and ice-themed ceremony at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing that concluded with the cauldron lit by two young Chinese Olympians, one of them a member of China's Uyghur minority.
During a performance that went longer than scheduled on a frigid night in the Chinese capital, President Xi Jinping declared the opening of an Olympics whose preparations were beset by the pandemic and criticism over human rights in China.
The Beijing Games, the second Olympics broadcast by NBC during the coronavirus pandemic, present an opportunity for the network, owned by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), to refine its strategy based on what it learned last summer. Its broadcast of the Tokyo Games, which were delayed for a year because of the pandemic, drew the smallest audience for the Summer Games since NBC began broadcasting them in 1988. Yet the competitions still pulled in the biggest audiences on television when they aired, making them attractive showcases for advertisers.
For Beijing, NBC said it is doing more to simplify the viewing experience, addressing criticism that last summer’s content was difficult to find across the company’s many platforms, including its Peacock streaming service. 

NBC is streaming every Beijing event live on Peacock’s premium tier, in addition to airing coverage across the NBC broadcast network, USA Network and CNBC cable networks, NBCOlympics.com website and NBC Sports app. It is also offering a customizable schedule on NBCOlympics.com, and air on-screen cues during studio segments that remind viewers what’s coming up.
NBCUniversal paid $7.65 billion to extend its U.S. broadcast rights for the Olympics through 2032.

In an apology video posted on Instagram on Saturday, Rogan said it was the ""most regretful and shameful thing that I've ever had to talk about publicly."" During the video, Rogan said footage that emerged of him using the epithet had been taken out of context, but looked ""horrible, even to me."" 
Rogan's apology came after Grammy award winning singer-songwriter India Arie pulled her music from the Spotify streaming service, which hosts Rogan's podcast, after posting clips on her Instagram feed of him using the N-word. 
In his apology, Rogan said the montage showed him using the epithet in conversations on shows over the last 12 years, and included examples of him discussing its use by Black and white comedians and others. He said he had not spoken it in years. 
""It's not my word to use. I am well aware of that now, but for years I used it in that manner,"" he said. ""I never used it to be racist because I'm not racist."" 
Media reports on Saturday said more than 70 episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast had been removed from the  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) service. 
Spotify did not return a request for comment.
On Monday, Rogan had apologized amid a backlash against COVID-19 misinformation in his program, and Spotify said it would add a content advisory to any episode with discussion of the virus.

Rogan, a mixed martial arts commentator and prominent vaccine skeptic, has stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic and on vaccines and government mandates to control the spread of the virus.
Singer-songwriters Neil Young and Joni Mitchell announced last week that they were removing their music from Spotify in protest at coronavirus misinformation broadcast on the platform.

The U.S. army confirmed that the commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, U.S. Army Major General Christopher Donahue, had arrived in Poland.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania to shield Eastern Europe from potential spillover from the Ukraine crisis.
About 1,700 service members, mainly paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, will deploy from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland in coming days, U.S. Army sources have said. 
According to the Pentagon, a squadron of around 1,000 U.S. service members based in the German town of Vilseck will be sent to Romania.
The first additional U.S. troops from the 18th Airborne Corps arrived in Germany on Friday.
""Our Corps' presence serves to bolster existing U.S. forces in Europe and demonstrates our commitment to our NATO allies and partners,"" spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, Captain Matt Visser, was quoted saying in a statement on Saturday.

Russia has denied planning to invade Ukraine but has deployed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and says it could take unspecified military measures if its demands are not met, including a promise by NATO never to admit Kyiv.
The latest U.S. deployment goes beyond the 8,500 troops the Pentagon put on alert last month to deploy to Europe if needed. NATO defence ministers are expected to discuss further reinforcements at their next meeting on Feb. 16-17.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) could name a new chief executive as early as Monday after the state-owned bank's nomination committee proposed the former head of Poland's Bank Pekao for the job, sources said.
Veteran Italian banker Luigi Lovaglio, 66, was picked by the committee on Friday to replace Guido Bastianini, two sources close to the matter said, one adding that the Italian Treasury is pleased with the choice which still needs to go through MPS's board.
MPS declined comment.
Known for his restructuring skills, Lovaglio would arrive at MPS at a delicate juncture.
MPS has fallen behind on a plan Italy agreed with the EU to clear the 2017 bailout that handed Rome a 64% stake in the lender, and the Treasury had stepped up pressure on Bastianini to quit after the collapse of a planned sale to UniCredit, Reuters reported on Jan. 30. 
But with Bastianini unwilling to depart, MPS's board is expected on Monday to strip him of his powers, sources have said. To free up a seat for the CEO, an MPS director stepped down on Friday. 
After failing to clinch the sale to UniCredit last year, the Treasury is negotiating with the European Union on a new privatisation deadline and restructuring targets. 
The board of MPS meets on Monday to approve its 2021 results as well as to decide Bastianini's future, the bank has said. 
During a four-decade career at UniCredit, Lovaglio led the group's Pekao unit from 2011 to 2017, when UniCredit sold its controlling stake.
In 2019 Lovaglio took the reins of regional bank Creval and steered it towards last year's takeover by Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) Italy.
Bastianini had been appointed in 2020 with the backing of the 5-Star Movement, which opposed MPS' sale in the near term.
Sources have said the Treasury wants an executive that would focus squarely on preparing the bank to be sold. Lovaglio appears to have prevailed over former BPER CEO Alessandro Vandelli for the MPS CEO post.

Complicating the new CEO's task, MPS must raise 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in capital in coming months.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A Venezuelan appeals court has upheld long prison terms on corruption charges for six former executives of oil refiner Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, the country's top court said.
The Supreme Court of Justice did not offer details late on Friday about the ruling on the executives, who were sentenced in November 2020. The ninth court of appeals in capital Caracas ""confirmed the sentence"", the court said in a statement.
The former executives, all naturalized U.S. citizens, were detained by Venezuelan authorities in 2017, accused of signing an unfavorable debt refinancing deal. Washington has repeatedly demanded their release. 
Their lawyer, Maria Alejandra Poleo, told Reuters they had not yet been formally informed of the decision.
""We expected the decision, now the Citgo Six are being used as exchange tokens in the political issues of the United States and Venezuela,"" Poleo said.

Former Citgo president Jose Pereira was sentenced to 13 years and seven months in jail and a $2 million fine, while the remaining five men face terms of eight years and 10 months.

President Joe Biden on Friday extended tariffs on imported solar energy equipment for four years, though he eased the terms to exclude bifacial panels that generate power on both sides, which are dominant among big U.S. projects.
Donald Trump imposed the tariffs on solar imports in 2018, using authority under section 201 of a 1974 trade law. The levies started at 30% and declined to 15%.
""The U.S. government insisted on extending the section 201 measures despite strong opposition from related parties at home and abroad, and they not only do not help the healthy development of the domestic U.S. industry, but also distort the normal order of international trade in photovoltaics as a new energy product,"" China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. 
China expressed hope that the United States would take ""concrete action"" to facilitate free trade in new energy products and ""contribute to the global development of a low greenhouse gas emission economy."" 

Driven by growing protectionism abroad as well as rising domestic demand, China's solar manufacturers have focused increasingly on the home market. 
China's solar capacity rose by a record 54.9 gigawatts (GW) last year to 306.6 GW. It aims to total wind and solar power capacity to a combined 1,200 GW by the end of the decade from 635 GW at the end of last year.

Shares of Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) surged 30% in extended trading on the news, which comes days after activist investor Blackwells Capital urged the company's board to put it up for sale. 
Amazon is exploring an offer for Peloton and is speaking with advisers about whether and how to proceed, a source said. Peloton has not yet decided whether it will explore a sale, according to the source. 
Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported https://www.ft.com/content/8ae3240b-8c09-48e4-bc2c-b7a9e4c00c51 late on Friday that sportswear company  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) is also evaluating a bid for Peloton, citing people briefed on the matter, who said the considerations are preliminary and Nike has not held talks with Peloton.
Peloton and Nike did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Amazon declined to comment.
Peloton's sales boomed during COVID-19 lockdowns, with many snapping up home fitness equipment. But its fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.
In November, it hinted that demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills was slowing faster than expected, and its market capitalization since then has shrunk to about $8 billion from a peak of nearly $52 billion in early 2021.
If the stock's gains hold on Monday, Peloton could reach the $10 billion market-capitalization threshold. 
Last week, Blackwells Capital called on the board of Peloton to remove CEO John Foley immediately, accusing him of deals that set high fixed costs and for holding on to excessive inventory, while misleading investors about the need to raise capital.
Blackwells criticized Foley for hiring his wife as a key executive and committing to a 300,000-square-foot, 20-year lease for office space in New York, among other things.
The investment firm, run by Jason Aintabi, has also urged the board to put the company up for sale to a buyer like Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group or Nike Inc, Reuters reported on Sunday.
Peloton has tried to cushion the blow to its growth by cutting the price of its popular bike and ramping up its ad spending, but growth remains stagnant.
Last month, Peloton said the company was reviewing the size of its workforce and ""resetting"" production levels, following a report that it was temporarily halting production of connected fitness bikes and treadmills after a significant drop in demand.
While many investors have become frustrated with Peloton due to a steep drop in its share price, analysts also note that the company may be a difficult acquisition target because of its two classes of stock, effectively allowing insiders to control it.
The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. (https://on.wsj.com/3AVMIf7)

The growth in the fitness band market has prompted tech giants such as Apple Inc and Samsung (KS:005930) to introduce features for health tracking, including electrocardiogram and blood pressure sensor. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google closed its acquisition of fitness tracking company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) Inc in January.
Tech giants including Amazon and Alphabet have also seen a rise in their valuation after blockbuster results this week. A day after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms suffered the deepest loss of stock market value in history for a U.S. company, Amazon logged the greatest ever one-day increase in value.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 10:27PM ET</span>",Special Report-Inside J&J’s secret plan to cap litigation payouts to cancer victims,"By Mike Spector and Dan Levine
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) created a plan last year to limit the financial bleeding from billions of dollars in jury awards to plaintiffs who alleged the company’s Baby Powder and other talc products caused deadly cancers. The healthcare and consumer-goods giant assigned more than 30 staffers to “Project Plato.” In a memo on the project in July, a company lawyer warned the team: Tell no one, not even your spouse.
“It is critical that any activities related to Project Plato, including the mere fact the project exists, be kept in strict confidence,” Chris Andrew, a J&J lawyer, wrote in an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.
The covert team would go on to evaluate a strategy to shift all the liability from about 38,000 pending talc cases onto a newly created subsidiary, which would immediately declare bankruptcy. The goal, as a lawyer for the subsidiary said in a court filing: To halt all the litigation and transfer the cases to bankruptcy court, where plaintiffs would compete for compensation from a limited pool of money.
In court and in public statements last July, Johnson & Johnson said it intended to keep fighting the allegations that its products were unsafe in trial courts. The company was actively defending itself in talc trials, including one that would result in a $27 million jury award that could be nullified by the bankruptcy maneuver. The plaintiff in that case now may have to instead seek compensation through a bankruptcy process.
Privately, J&J took concrete steps starting as early as April to consider and plan the bankruptcy maneuver, according to internal company documents, depositions and other court records reviewed by Reuters. The strategy seeks to ensure the pending cases never reach a jury and instead be handled in a bankruptcy court.
The documents provide the most detailed account to date of how the New Jersey-based conglomerate strategized to limit compensation to tens of thousands of talc plaintiffs. 
Reuters exclusively reported the broad outlines of the bankruptcy strategy being explored by J&J in July. The company went ahead with the plan in October, offloading responsibility for the cases to the new subsidiary, which then filed for bankruptcy. Before the filing, the company faced costs from $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgment of more than $2 billion, according to bankruptcy-court records.
Now, J&J proposes to give the subsidiary in bankruptcy $2 billion to put into a trust to compensate all 38,000 current plaintiffs, as well as all future claimants. J&J has said in court filings and in public statements that the subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, could also tap a stream of royalty revenues valued at more than $350 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
J&J did not answer detailed written questions from Reuters about its planning of the bankruptcy maneuver. In a statement, J&J defended the LTL bankruptcy as a way to resolve the talc claims.
“This filing follows established process, and courts have uniformly acknowledged that equitably resolving these types of claims through Chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process,” the statement said. “LTL’s objective is to reach a fair and equitable resolution for claimants through a plan of reorganization and create a reasonable framework to address the unprecedented number of existing and future talc-related claims.”
It continued: “We stand behind the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder, which is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. We continue to believe resolving this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible is in the best interests of claimants and all stakeholders. We will continue to follow the process and put forth our position in the court.”
On Thursday, a lawyer for the J&J subsidiary appeared at a bankruptcy hearing and accused attorneys for people who have sued Johnson & Johnson over its talc products of sharing confidential documents with Reuters in a ""calculated"" effort to try the case ""in the press."" 
Later Thursday, lawyers for J&J and its subsidiary sought a temporary restraining order from the bankruptcy judge to block Reuters from publishing information that, the company claims, comes from confidential documents. 
A Reuters spokesperson called J&J’s claims without merit.
""We reject the factually-unfounded and legally-meritless claims made by J&J's lawyers and will continue to report without fear or favor on matters of public interest,"" the spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.
BANKRUPTCY BENEFITS WITHOUT BURDENS
J&J started secretly considering and planning the maneuver to redirect plaintiffs to bankruptcy court as early as April, when company attorneys were briefed on the strategy by lawyers at Jones Day, a firm with experience in the tactic, according to deposition testimony from an LTL lawyer. 
On July 19, the day after Reuters broke the news of the strategy, a J&J official contacted Moody’s, the Wall Street ratings firm, to ask if the subsidiary bankruptcy would harm the company’s pristine credit, according to emails reviewed by Reuters. She was told it likely wouldn’t because the agency would only consider the maneuver’s impact on the finances of J&J, and not those of the subsidiary in bankruptcy. 
The exchange underscores why the strategy was so attractive: J&J could create a related-party bankruptcy to limit liability, while avoiding “the burdens” of declaring bankruptcy itself, seven legal experts argued in an amicus brief filed with the court.
Moody’s declined to comment.
In court papers, a lawyer for the J&J subsidiary said the bankruptcy filing was a ""prudent and necessary"" step that ""offered the only alternative for equitably and permanently resolving"" all the talc litigation. 
Last July, Reuters reported that one of J&J’s attorneys told plaintiffs’ lawyers that the company could pursue the bankruptcy plan, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time, J&J publicly downplayed concerns about the strategy and did not confirm that it was exploring the option. “Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,” the company told Reuters at the time. 
A few days later, in a California courtroom, a lawyer defending J&J against talc plaintiffs told a judge that news of the bankruptcy strategy amounted to unsubstantiated “rumors.” J&J executed the bankruptcy plan starting on Oct. 11, taking the first steps to create the new subsidiary. The new company swiftly filed for Chapter 11, on Oct. 14.
'ALTERNATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM'
The strategy, while rare, could be adopted more widely by big companies facing liability crises if Johnson & Johnson gets bankruptcy-court approval, according to lawyers for talc plaintiffs and some legal experts. If J&J succeeds, they argue, it could provide a blueprint for Corporate America on how to circumvent jury trials involving allegations of defective products or misconduct.
Such a precedent could allow companies to routinely pursue related-party bankruptcies to escape accountability from juries, said Melissa Jacoby, a University of North Carolina law professor. 
“That's one step closer to making bankruptcy an alternative justice system for big corporations,” Jacoby said. “If a company as deeply pocketed as J&J can do this, where does it stop?” 
In testimony last November, a lawyer for the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary said the company pursued the strategy in reaction to an onslaught of litigation with the potential for outsized jury awards. A bankruptcy court, the lawyer argued, could provide a more consistent and equitable process for compensating claimants. Johnson & Johnson has said it would provide a fair amount of money to the subsidiary to pay claims.
Johnson & Johnson, valued at more than $450 billion, had about $31 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of the third quarter, securities filings show.
The New Jersey judge overseeing the subsidiary’s bankruptcy is scheduled on Feb. 14 to begin hearing arguments on plaintiff-creditors’ contention that the bankruptcy should be dismissed because it was filed in bad faith. 
The October bankruptcy temporarily halted the litigation against Johnson & Johnson. LTL has said it will seek to “permanently” resolve the talc litigation through a reorganization plan that would prohibit current and future plaintiffs from seeking redress in a trial court. Instead, their claims would be directed to a trust, which would divvy up a limited amount of money through an administrative process approved by the bankruptcy court.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PLAINTIFFS
J&J’s bankruptcy strategy is the latest example of the company’s efforts to manage liability amid mounting allegations that asbestos lurks in its iconic Baby Powder and other talc products. A December 2018 Reuters investigation revealed that the company knew for decades about tests showing its talc sometimes contained carcinogenic asbestos but kept that information from regulators and the public. 
Tens of thousands of plaintiffs, many with mesothelioma or ovarian cancer, have filed lawsuits alleging that exposure to talc in J&J’s Baby Powder and other company products made them sick. Records J&J produced in response to those lawsuits led plaintiff lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn’t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. 
That assertion, backed by decades of science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court. The company has insisted in lawsuits and public-relations campaigns that the product was safe and asbestos-free.
One plaintiff is Thomas McHattie, 78 years old, who traveled the world as an obstetrician-gynecologist before receiving a mesothelioma diagnosis in March 2020. McHattie said he recommended Baby Powder to “countless pregnant women” while also using it himself. McHattie said he endured five courses of chemotherapy to treat tumors in his abdomen, and has suffered from pronounced fatigue and shortness of breath. 
He sued J&J in New York in July, a few months after receiving his diagnosis. His case had not yet gone to trial when LTL Management filed for bankruptcy.
In a 2020 court filing, J&J said it denied “each and every allegation, statement, matter and thing” asserted by McHattie in his lawsuit.
McHattie told Reuters in an interview that he was “disappointed they’ve chosen to do what is expedient and not what is right.”
“There is no excuse for them filing a bankruptcy,” McHattie said. “Why? This is a solvent company.” 
RELEASED FROM LIABILITY
J&J’s subsidiary bankruptcy is one variation of a longstanding and increasingly controversial tactic of limiting liability through so-called nondebtor releases granted to companies, owners or executives. The releases can allow companies or executives to piggyback on the bankruptcies of other entities to obtain broad protection from lawsuits and restrict litigation payouts. The party receiving the release typically agrees to contribute a lump sum to the company in bankruptcy to pay off plaintiffs in exchange for an exemption from all future liability.
That was the case with members of the Sackler family, the billionaire owners of Purdue Pharma LP, which filed for bankruptcy as a hail of lawsuits alleged it had contributed to a deadly addiction epidemic with its opioid painkiller, OxyContin. In a landmark decision in December, a U.S. district judge in New York invalidated Purdue’s bankruptcy reorganization plan on the grounds that it improperly insulated the Sackler family from liability through nondebtor releases. 
Purdue has appealed the ruling. The company pleaded guilty in November 2020 to three felonies covering misconduct regarding its handling of opioids. Sackler family members, who also faced litigation, have denied allegations they contributed to the opioid crisis. 
J&J’s bankruptcy takes the approach a step further. Instead of seeking releases from liability in an existing bankruptcy proceeding, the company created a bankruptcy by forming a company that plaintiff-creditors allege has no business purpose other than to limit J&J’s legal exposure. 
Lawyers for talc plaintiffs contend that the J&J maneuver amounts to an abuse of the bankruptcy system, which is intended to help a struggling business reorganize – and not to help a well-capitalized conglomerate limit legal liability for alleged wrongdoing.
“This case is all about litigation advantage” for J&J, said Robert Stark, a Brown Rudnick LLP lawyer representing a creditors’ committee of talc plaintiffs during a December hearing of the subsidiary’s bankruptcy. J&J successfully halted the claims by tens of thousands of plaintiffs “while people are dying of cancer” and trying to prepare their families financially for their deaths, Stark said at the hearing. “It does not get more inhumane than that,” he said. 
The Purdue and J&J bankruptcy strategies have sparked efforts in the U.S. Congress to stop such tactics. U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois is co-sponsoring legislation with other Democrats that would all but outlaw the strategy J&J is using and restrict the ability of companies to obtain liability releases without declaring bankruptcy themselves.
“Our bankruptcy code and civil procedure has to be explored to make sure that this exploitation does not take place,” Durbin said in an interview. 
Business groups and some bankruptcy lawyers say that nondebtor releases can be an effective tool to resolve litigation to the benefit of both plaintiffs and the companies they sue. While limited amounts for compensation are often criticized, they offer plaintiffs better odds of getting paid than if they take their chances in trial courts, said Donald Workman, a Baker & Hostetler restructuring lawyer who isn’t involved in the J&J subsidiary’s case.
“You have an elegant solution to resolve burdensome if not crushing obligations,” Workman said, that “provides funding for constituencies that might otherwise receive nothing.”
TEXAS TWO-STEP
J&J turned to the bankruptcy plan following a series of setbacks.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration found trace amounts of asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder purchased online, forcing the company to issue a recall in October 2019. In May 2020, the company stopped selling talc-based Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada, citing “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” regarding the product's safety. 
In April, J&J attorneys consulted with Jones Day lawyers, who explained how the company could use a Texas law to split the company’s consumer-product business into two parts. One would absorb all the talc liability; the other would carry on the business free from the threat of billion-dollar judgments. Texas pioneered the so-called divisional merger, which allows companies to break apart and more easily divvy up assets and liabilities among the resulting companies.
Jones Day helped Georgia-Pacific, a company owned by conglomerate Koch Industries, execute the maneuver in 2017 to offload mounting asbestos litigation. Georgia-Pacific faced allegations regarding asbestos exposure from building products that spanned decades.
Georgia-Pacific used the Texas law to create a new subsidiary called Bestwall to shoulder asbestos liability. As the subsidiary declared bankruptcy, the “new” Georgia-Pacific continued to produce Brawny paper towels and other lucrative brands. The maneuver came to be known in legal circles as a “Texas two-step.”
Georgia-Pacific paid nearly $3 billion in dividends to Koch over the next several years, according to a court filing, that it might have been unable to dole out had it filed for bankruptcy itself. Georgia-Pacific has proposed giving Bestwall $1 billion to settle all asbestos claims, an amount plaintiff-creditors are still challenging in bankruptcy court.
Koch Industries and Georgia-Pacific declined to comment; Jones Day did not respond to a request for comment.
When J&J needed help last year, it hired Dallas-based Jones Day partner Greg Gordon and other members of the firm’s Georgia-Pacific legal team. 
As the bankruptcy planning moved forward, a major court defeat heightened the urgency. In June of last year, J&J lost a bid to reverse a watershed verdict in favor of 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on Baby Powder and other talc products. The women had initially won a verdict of $4.69 billion from a Missouri jury. A state appeals court reduced the award to more than $2 billion.
PROJECT PLATO
By July 12, the company had secretly set up the Project Plato team. The more than 30 employees staffing it came from J&J’s finance, risk management, tax and business development operations, according to the internal J&J memo and deposition testimony. 
A week later, J&J treasurer Michelle Ryan reached out to Moody’s to get guidance on the impact to J&J’s credit rating.
“We are looking at a number of ways of capping our talc liability,” Ryan said in a July 19 email to Michael Levesque, a senior vice president at the credit-ratings firm focused on pharmaceutical companies. One scenario under consideration, Ryan said, would be to “capture the liability in one subsidiary” and then “basically bankrupt that subsidiary.”
Ryan asked whether the bankruptcy would hurt the company’s credit rating. J&J at the time was one of just two U.S. companies with a triple-A rating, the other being Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
Levesque replied that the “technical aspect” of the subsidiary bankruptcy wasn’t likely to cause concern about J&J’s creditworthiness. Rather, he said, Moody’s was “highly likely” to focus on how the subsidiary’s Chapter 11 filing affected J&J’s finances, which the maneuver intended to help.
Ryan did not respond to a request for comment.
To execute the plan, J&J created a limited liability company on Oct. 11 in Texas through a series of transactions. That company then merged with J&J’s existing consumer products business. The merged company then divided itself under the state’s divisional merger law, creating the subsidiary that would take on all the talc liability.
The consumer business could then go on as if the lawsuits had never been filed. 
GREEN LIGHT
Early on the morning of Oct. 11, Andrew, the in-house J&J lawyer who initially sent the internal memo to the Project Plato team, sent an email to eight J&J colleagues, including several senior executives. He asked them to approve the Texas two-step bankruptcy plan “as soon as possible” and no later than that day, according to Andrews’ email to his colleagues, which was reviewed by Reuters.
He attached a detailed memo outlining the impending bankruptcy’s purported benefits. It would allow, the memo said, the bankruptcy court to determine the final amount of money for resolving all of the litigation, in a process enabling claims to be settled in an “equitable and efficient manner, without the waste and abuses experienced in the state court tort system.” 
The memo warned of risks. The plan would be consummated under a tight time frame and would be scrutinized by the media. “Appropriate messaging (internally and externally) will be required to avoid or mitigate misunderstandings about the nature of the restructuring and negative publicity,” the memo said.
Andrew quickly received the green light, within hours of the request, internal emails reviewed by Reuters show.
LTL, the new subsidiary, held its first board meeting on Oct. 14. 
The board members and lawyers discussed that LTL faced what they viewed as “exorbitant” costs if the current talc litigation barrage continued, which included 12,000 lawsuits alone through the first nine-and-a-half months of 2021, according to meeting minutes and deposition testimony Reuters reviewed. The group noted that J&J faced a total of about $5 billion in costs from judgments, settlements and legal fees.
The board voted to pursue a Chapter 11 filing. J&J disclosed the move in a news release that evening as one that would “equitably” resolve the litigation. 
A plaintiffs’ lawyer grilled Robert Wuesthoff – a J&J manager appointed president of LTL Management – on that point in a Dec. 22 deposition.
“One of the considerations was to treat claimants equitably; it was for their benefit? Is that what you're saying?” asked Jeffrey Jonas, a Brown Rudnick lawyer representing a creditors committee comprising talc plaintiffs.

“Yes, it would be more equitable to the claimant. Yes, we believe that,” Wuesthoff responded.
“But the real reason we filed for bankruptcy,” the LTL executive said, was that the large and growing amount of talc cases – some with “lottery-size” awards – put J&J’s consumer products business in “financial distress.”

813,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 09:25PM ET</span>",China suspected in hack of journalists at News Corp,"By Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -Digital intruders broke into News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) email accounts and compromised the data of an unspecified number of journalists, the company disclosed Friday. 
The media firm's internet security adviser said the hack was likely aimed at gathering intelligence for Beijing's benefit.
News Corp, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, said the breach was discovered in late January and affected emails and documents of what it described as a limited number of employees, including journalists. It said that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had contained the breach.
David Wong, vice president of consulting at Mandiant, said the hackers were believed to have ""a China nexus, and we believe they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests.""
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said he was unaware of the details of the reports but that he hoped ""there can be a professional, responsible and evidence-based approach to identifying cyber-related incidents, rather than making allegations based on speculations.""
In a letter seen by Reuters, company executives told their employees that “we believe the activity affected a limited number of business email accounts and documents from News Corp headquarters, News Technology Services, Dow Jones, News UK, and New York Post.”
""Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,"" executives said.
The company added that its other business units, including HarperCollins Publishers, Move, News Corp Australia, Foxtel, REA, and Storyful, were not targeted in the attack. News Corp shares were down 1.3% in morning trading.
The Wall Street Journal, which reported the news first, competes with Reuters, the news division of  Thomson Reuters  Corp (NYSE:TRI.TO), in supplying news to media outlets.
Chinese hackers have repeatedly been blamed for hacks of journalists both in the United States and elsewhere.
In 2013, for example, the New York Times reported a breach which it said had affected 53 personal computers belonging to its employees. The paper said the timing of those intrusions corresponded with its investigation into the wealth accumulated by relatives of Wen Jiabao, China’s then-prime minister.
The report was the first in a series of contemporaneous disclosures about similar intrusions or attempted intrusions at other U.S. media organizations, including Bloomberg, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. 
Beijing's hackers have been targeting Western journalists for years, said Mike McLellan, the director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has tracked China-linked spying on media organizations on-and-off over the past decade.
He said journalists might have access to valuable sources of intelligence about China's adversaries or its domestic opponents. 

Even considered against China's reputation for aggressive cyber espionage against a range of targets - from military secrets to intellectual property - McLellan said media remained a favorite.
“Journalists — and the things they're working on — are fairly high on their list of priorities,"" he said.

(Reuters) -A day after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms suffered the deepest loss of stock market value in history for a U.S. company, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) logged the greatest ever one-day increase in value.
Shares of the online retail and cloud computing giant surged 13.5% on Friday following its blowout quarterly report, expanding its market capitalization by around $190 billion by the end of trading.
That beat Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s record $181 billion one-day gain in stock market value on Jan. 28 following the iPhone maker's own blockbuster quarterly report, according to Refinitiv data. 
Amazon is now valued at about $1.6 trillion. With Meta Platforms' stock slipping 0.3% on Friday, its value stood at about $660 billion.
Amazon's shares jumped after the company reported better-than-expected profits late on Thursday and said it was hiking the price of its annual U.S. Prime subscriptions by 17%.
Amazon's surge comes a day after Meta Platforms' stock market value plunged more than $200 billion in the biggest single-day loss for a U.S. company after the social media giant issued a dismal forecast.
""After fighting the post-lockdown blues in 2021, we believe Amazon's fortunes have the potential to improve as 2022 unfolds,"" Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White wrote in a research note. ""Amazon is uniquely positioned to exit this crisis as one of the biggest beneficiaries of accelerated digital transformation.""
Retail investors appeared to use Amazon's rally to take profits. Data on Fidelity's website showed Amazon was the most traded stock among its customers on Friday, with sell orders outnumbering buy orders by more than two to one.
The size of the increase in Amazon's value eclipsed the market capitalizations of companies including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Apple,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc remain Wall Street's most valuable companies, with market capitalizations of $2.8 trillion, $2.3 trillion and $1.9 trillion, respectively, according to Refinitiv.
Amazon's stock price remains down around 15% from its record high close of $3,731.41 in July.

The changes come a day after the Detroit automaker warned a chip shortage would lead to a decline to vehicle volume in the current quarter. 
Production at factories in Michigan, Chicago and in Cuautitlan, Mexico will be suspended. In Kansas City, production of its F-150 pickup trucks will be idled while one shift will run for production of its Transit vans.
The Detroit automaker will also run a single shift or a reduced schedule at its factories in Dearborn, Kentucky and Louisville, while removing overtime at its Oakville factory in Canada.
All changes will be in place for the week beginning Feb. 7.

Ford shares slumped on Friday, after the automaker posted smaller-than-expected quarterly income and forecast a slower recovery in 2022 vehicle production than rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) 
However, the company said it expected vehicle volume to improve significantly in the second half.

(Reuters) - Another bumpy ride on Wall Street ended on Friday as Amazon's positive earnings capped a run of mixed big-tech numbers, with the Nasdaq recovering much of its losses from the previous session and all three benchmarks ending the week in positive territory.
Results from megacap growth stocks have dictated market moves this week, as investors seek out tangible data to support sky-high valuations.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 13.5% after reporting robust earnings in the holiday quarter. The gain expanded its market capitalization by around $190 billion, the largest ever single-day increase in value of a U.S. company.
This came a day after Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc's disappointing results shook markets and wiped more than $200 billion off its valuation, the deepest loss of stock market value in history by a U.S. company.
""These are eye-watering, stomach churning moves normally associated with penny stocks, and yet they are happening in companies with billion-dollar market caps,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Despite the earnings-driven whiplash in technology stocks, all three major stock indexes ended their first week of February higher, with the indexes posting their second week of gains in a row.
While Meta lost another 0.3% on Friday, other social media companies which had been dragged down with the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner rebounded strongly as they posted estimate-beating earnings of their own.
Among them was  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), surging 58.8% after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter user growth and outlook.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc also jumped 11.2% after its quarterly revenue beat estimates as retailers splurged on advertising during the holiday quarter.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.42 points, or 0.06%, to 35,089.74, the S&P 500 gained 23.09 points, or 0.52%, to 4,500.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 219.19 points, or 1.58%, to 14,098.01.
Among the major S&P 500 sectors which advanced, energy stocks hit their highest since 2018 as crude prices touched a seven-year peak. [O/R]
 Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) was the largest gainer in the sector, jumping 4% to its highest close since September 2014. Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) gained 2%, with its shares ending at levels last seen in February 2020.
Consumer discretionary was the leading sector though, up 3.7% as it was bolstered by Amazon's performance. The tech behemoth's gains helped alleviate the drag of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which slumped 9.7% after the automaker posted disappointing quarterly numbers.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 467,000 jobs last month, compared with the 150,000 jobs addition forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The data for December was revised higher to show 510,000 jobs created, instead of the previously reported 199,000.
Fears of faster-than-expected rate hikes to curb a surge in inflation have haunted markets since the beginning of the year, with growth stocks such as technology feeling the brunt of that as investors pivot towards current cash flow from betting on future expectations.
""A lot of the high-valuation stuff is going to continue to have trouble and it's already gotten smacked down a lot,"" said Louis Ricci, head of trading at Emles Advisors.
""To us, this jobs report was affirmation that, yes, stocks are going to be jittery and there's going to be a lot of volatility.""
However, the rate hike prospect has boosted U.S. Treasuries, with yields on the 10-year benchmark hitting their highest levels since December 2019, in the wake of the payrolls data. This is regarded as positive for financials, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co all gaining between 1.8% and 4% on Friday.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.07 billion shares, compared with the 12.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 196 new lows.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",J&J tried to get federal judge to block publication of Reuters story,"By Maria Chutchian and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) tried to get a U.S. judge to block Reuters from publishing a story based on what it said were confidential company documents about the healthcare giant's legal maneuvers to fight lawsuits claiming its Baby Powder caused cancer.
""The First Amendment is not a license to knowingly violate the law,"" said the company in a filing late Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey, where a unit of J&J had sought bankruptcy protection while defending the Baby Powder lawsuits. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of the press.
On Friday, Reuters reported that J&J secretly launched ""Project Plato"" last year to shift liability from about 38,000 pending Baby Powder talc lawsuits to a newly created subsidiary, which was then to be put into bankruptcy. By doing so, J&J could limit its financial exposure to the lawsuits.
After the publication of the story, Reuters asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan to deny J&J's motion, claiming it was moot. Less than an hour after Reuters submitted its letter, J&J said in a filing that it was withdrawing a request for an immediate hearing on the matter but was ""not prepared to agree"" that its request regarding the documents was moot.
J&J said in its filing after the publication of the story that it intends to continue discussions with Reuters and said it was ""heartened that publication of confidential documents may no longer be imminent.""
J&J's request to block publication was ""among the most extraordinary remedies a litigant can request under the law,"" attorneys for Reuters, a unit of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), said in a Friday court filing. The news agency's lawyers called J&J's request a ""prior restraint of speech on a matter of public interest.""
J&J said Reuters had obtained documents that were protected from public disclosure by an order from Kaplan. The company demanded that Reuters return the documents and refrain from publishing information gleaned from the documents.
""This is a complex matter that should be heard by the court – in a forum where both sides present their cases in an appropriate setting – and not argued through the media,"" a J&J spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.
Reuters denied that it has confidential information, saying in court papers that the confidentiality of one of the documents was lifted in January and that the second is not in the possession of Reuters.
J&J's LTL unit filed for bankruptcy in October to resolve the claims alleging J&J's talc-based products contained asbestos and caused mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.
J&J maintains that its consumer talc products are safe and have been confirmed to be asbestos-free. 

The company has said it placed LTL into bankruptcy to settle those claims rather than litigating them individually. It has said resolving these claims through Chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process.
Talc plaintiff committees argue that J&J should not be permitted to use bankruptcy to address the talc litigation and that by doing so, it is depriving plaintiffs their day in court.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Friday said they are considering lengthening the recommended interval between the first two doses of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines to eight weeks to lower the risk of heart inflammation and improve their effectiveness.
Dr. Sara Oliver, an official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency was considering making the recommendation for  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech shots during a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of outside advisers to the CDC.
In the United States, the recommended interval between the first two shots of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine is three weeks and for Moderna's, four. 
In her presentation, Dr. Oliver said an extended interval appears to reduce the risk of already rare cases of myocarditis, and that the lowest rates of heart inflammation following vaccination occur if the vaccines are given eight weeks apart.
Myocarditis is a rare side effect seen with mRNA vaccines - the technology behind both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. It appears to be more common among young men. 
Oliver also said the extended interval appears to increase vaccine efficacy.
If the agency does change the recommended interval, there may be some populations for which the shorter gap is still preferred, Oliver said, particularly groups where the benefits of earlier protection against COVID-19 outweigh the risk of myocarditis.
The move would come late in the U.S. vaccination campaign, as more than 212 million people in the country are fully vaccinated, according to government data.

But there are still around 33 million unvaccinated people in the United States between ages of 12 and 39, Oliver said, the age range that puts them at higher risk of myocarditis after the shots.
Canadian health officials had presented data to the group earlier in the day about why they had settled on a recommended eight-week interval between shots of the two vaccines.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 05:25PM ET</span>",Inflation data next focus for investors after bond yield spike,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild swings in stocks and a sharp run-up in government bond yields are putting the spotlight on next week’s U.S. inflation data, as investors brace for more volatility across assets.
A turbulent week in markets ended with a surge in Treasury yields to their highest level in more than two years after surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data stoked expectations of a more hawkish Federal Reserve.
Robust data on inflation – which hit its highest annual level in nearly four decades in December – could further bolster the case for a more aggressive Fed and extend the climb in yields, dulling the allure of an equity market struggling to rebound from last month’s tumble.
Due out on Thursday, the U.S. consumer price index for January is expected to have risen 0.5%, culminating in an annual rise of 7.3%, which would be the largest such increase since 1982, according to a Reuters poll. 
“We could potentially get a very difficult number to digest next week on the inflation front and that has the potential to cut the markets off at the knees,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which moves inversely to prices, has climbed about 40 basis points in 2022 to over 1.9% as investors factor in at least five rate increases from the Fed this year. 
The climb has weighed on equities overall while contributing to steep declines in the shares of many tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely on future profits that are discounted more steeply as bond yields rise. The benchmark S&P 500 is down about 5.6% so far to start the year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq logging a nearly 10% drop.
“The reason why people are hitting the reset button ... is because valuations were pulled forward a lot,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management. ""With rising rates, the valuations just can’t be justified. So whenever there is a little bit of a miss (on earnings) is when these stocks get punished quite a bit.""
The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 has fallen to 19.5 times from 21.7 times at the end of 2021, while the forward P/E for the S&P 500 tech sector has dropped to 24.4 from 28.5, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Some investors believe stocks have further to fall before they become attractive. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Friday urged clients to sell into equity rallies as “a tightening Fed historically brings lower returns and great uncertainty for equities” and wrote that the S&P 500’s fair value is closer to 4,000. The benchmark index on Friday rose around 0.5% to 4,500.
Others are questioning whether the growth stocks that have led the markets higher for years are ceding leadership to so-called value stocks, comparatively cheap stocks that are expected to do better in a rising rate or inflationary environment.
The S&P 500 value index, replete with shares of energy firms, financial companies and other economically sensitive names, had declined 1.4% so far this year as of Thursday, versus a 10.2% drop for its S&P 500 growth counterpart. That disparity would be close to value's biggest annual outperformance over growth in two decades.
""You are seeing gradually higher market interest rates that is causing investors to reassess and to look at near-term profitability and the value and cyclical trade,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management.
The market was also digesting a topsy-turvy week of high-profile earnings. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared after their respective quarterly reports while megacap peer Meta Platforms Inc tumbled after the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner's dour forecast.
Next week, reports are due from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp set to report the following week.

As with Meta Platforms, any disappointments in reports - especially from companies whose valuations remain expensive - could result in severe market fallout, investors said. 
""It’s been a volatile start to the year with investors swinging between concerns over Federal Reserve tightening and confidence in the economic recovery,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said in a research note. ""Meta aside, a solid earnings outlook is helping to ease the uncertainty, at least for the moment.""

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Developing world investors, buffeted by various ""taper tantrums"" over the last decade, are now nervously watching as the rainmaker of global markets - the U.S. Federal Reserve - readies its most aggressive rate hike cycle in 17 years.
More hot jobs data on Friday drove the benchmark for world borrowing costs, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, to its highest level in two years, prompting yet more gnashing of teeth among emerging market money managers already having a tough year.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s analysts point out that while some currencies managed to save face here and there, anyone who took the approach of hedging forex risk would have seen only one year that started worse than this one since 2010.
Fed tightening has not been bad news for all EM assets though.
EM stocks measured by MSCI's 25-country MSCIEF are flat for the year, which means they have done 5% better than their developed market peers, which is something of a pattern according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s analysts.
""The outperformance of EM (stocks) after the first (Fed) hike is notable,"" they said, noting that in Fed hike cycles since 1980, the MSCIEF has been up 17% on average six months after the first rate increase is delivered.
Morgan Stanley analysts have not yet made the call to ""buy EM,"" but they say ""it suggests that the time to get more bullish on EM may be approaching.""
The massive outperformance from Latin American stocks in January could be a harbinger of more EM gains.

One silver lining in last year's rout of Chinese stock markets is that many investors think they have a good chance of rebounding this year with authorities there now providing support to the economy again. 
Swiss-based European fund heavyweight Pictet upgraded its view on Chinese stocks to ""positive"" this week on the basis of that support, and because they would probably be a good hedge in the event of a full-blown Russia-Ukraine military conflict.
""Chinese equities could recoup last year’s declines and narrow the valuation gap with their counterparts in the coming months,"" the firm's chief strategist, Luca Paolini, said.

DORMANT DOLLAR 
However, a more aggressive tightening cycle by the Fed and other top central banks could quickly reignite bond market pressures, said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of emerging market local markets and sovereign debt strategy, Jonny Goulden.
The ""taper tantrum"" shock of 2013-14, when the prospect of a reduction in post-financial crisis support from the Fed hit emerging market assets hard, still haunts EM veterans.
Returns on JPMorgan's hard currency emerging markets bond index EMBI Global Diversified are -2.6% since the start of the year, while those for the local currency fixed income benchmark are at 1%.
""The Fed tightening cycle remains the focus for EM, but so far this year these pressures are curiously materializing in credit rather than local markets,"" Goulden said in a note to clients on Friday. 
""We would normally expect these forces to drive greater dollar strength, but EM FX (year-to-date) spot returns are +1%.""
Data on capital flows backed up this trend, Goulden added, saying short-term fund flows had also shifted with emerging market local bond funds pulling in more than $1 billion while hard-currency funds suffered $2.3 billion of outflows to start 2022.
Deutsche Bank said since 2013 Mexico, Poland, the Philippines and Hungary are the EMs with the highest correlation to rising U.S. yields, when looking at their local 10-year benchmarks. 
""During large moves, we find that all countries (but China) have provided negative returns during periods of extreme bearish moves in U.S. Treasuries,"" Deutsche's analysts said, showing that bonds from Turkey, the Philippines, Mexico and Peru posted the biggest losses. 
Given their expectation of a U.S. 10-year yield at 2.25% by the end of next month, DB analysts imply a forex-hedged return for EM fixed income that would actually outperform Treasuries on a ""total return"" basis which takes into account any currency move.

""However, this would still not necessarily be a strong buying argument at this point in time,"" they said. ""We recommend that despite the recent underperformance, investors maintain a more cautious approach on the asset class.""

The vaccine has been in use under the U.S Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization since December 2020, and is now the second fully approved vaccine for COVID-19 in the United States. 
Earlier on Friday, a CDC panel voted unanimously to recommend the vaccine's use, after the FDA granted full approval of the shot on Monday. 
While the FDA approves vaccines, the CDC needs to sign off on how they will be implemented in the United States. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky's green light is the final formality of the approval process. 
The vaccine will now be sold under the brand name as Spikevax.

The COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) received full approval for those aged 16 and over in August.

Biogen in its annual report on Thursday said it received a civil investigative demand, similar to a subpoena, from the FTC. The FTC is tasked with oversight of industry competition and consumer protection.
The SEC regulates securities markets and works to protect investors.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June approved Biogen's Aduhelm - the first treatment for Alzheimer's in decades - despite one of its two large-scale clinical trials failing to show a benefit to patients. A panel of its expert advisers voted against the drug, and some panel members resigned.
In July, the FDA asked the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services to open an investigation into interactions with Biogen related to the approval of the drug. 
U.S. lawmakers have also launched an investigation into the drug.
Since the launch, sales of Aduhelm have been slow and Biogen cut the price by 50% in December.
In January, the U.S. Medicare health plan for the disabled and those aged 65 and over, the age group in which Alzheimer's disease is most prevalent, proposed covering the drug only for people enrolled in a new clinical trial. A final plan is expected in April.

Biogen said in the filing that the agencies were seeking information related to healthcare sites, the approval and marketing.
The FTC declined to comment and the SEC did not respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday rejected former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli's objections to being banned for life from the drug industry and having to repay $64.6 million after jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug.
Lawyers for Shkreli, 38, had argued that the ban was overbroad and violated his right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by barring him from publicly discussing the drug industry, even on a blog.
In imposing a permanent injunction, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said Shkreli's antitrust violations cost him that right when he intended to ""influence the management or business"" of a pharmaceutical company.
The Manhattan-based judge also said that requiring Shkreli to sell his shares in Phoenixus AG, the parent of Vyera Pharmaceuticals Inc, did not violate his due process rights after he used his position as its largest shareholder to orchestrate the antitrust violations.
Shkreli is serving a seven-year prison sentence in an unrelated securities fraud case.
His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In imposing the lifetime ban on Jan. 14, Cote found that Shkreli used ""particularly heartless and coercive"" tactics to maintain a monopoly over the drug Daraprim, which treats a parasitic infection, and keep generic rivals off the market.
Shkreli gained notoriety in 2015 and became known as ""Pharma Bro"" when he raised Daraprim's price overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50.
He had at the time been chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, later renamed Vyera. 

Cote's rulings followed a non-jury trial in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission and seven U.S. states.
Shkreli is eligible for release from prison on Nov. 7.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched a two-week win streak Friday as Amazon's swashbuckling gains led tech out of the clutches of despair after a surprisingly strong jobs report sent U.S. Treasury yields to multi-year highs.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.06%, or 21 points, the Nasdaq rallied 1.3%.
The U.S. economy created 467,000 jobs last month, well above the expectations for 150,000, led by job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, which confounded expectations that an omicron-impact would weigh on the services industry.
Average hourly earnings increased by a better than expected 0.7% for the month, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4%.
U.S. yields surged on expectations for more aggressive Fed action, with the U.S. 10-year yield jumping above 1.9% for the first time in more than two years.
Tech climbed out of early-day trouble against the backdrop of rising rates as strong quarterly earnings from Amazon restored sentiment on growth somewhat after Meta’s plunge a day earlier.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied more than 13%, notching the record for the biggest one-day market cap gain, following better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and fiscal first quarter guidance.
The bulk of earnings beat was led by gains from the company’s Rivian stake, but better than feared Q1 guidance and the move to hike the annual price of U.S. Prime subscriptions to offset costs also helped boost investor sentiment.
“Amazon’s profitability should expand as it grows opex more slowly than revenues. Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and ads should drive steady margin expansion, with Prime memberships driving overall retail revenue growth,” Wedbush said in a note.
Other megacap stocks including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) retreated from the day's highs to end mixed. Meta Platforms lost about $250 billion in market cap after plunging 26% on Thursday.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP), meanwhile, jumped 58% following quarterly results that topped expectations,
The wild swings in markets recently, however, is expected to continue, and likely sets up rocky road for the weeks ahead until there is more certainty about the path of inflation and the Fed’s plan to tighten monetary policy.
“Volatility generally means bear markets … the fact that we've seen a spike in volatility doesn't bode well for overall markets,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday. Volatility is set to continue until  “some of these other factors, primarily the Fed and inflation, settle down.”
Portfolio positioning would be best served by companies ""that are able to pass on price increases to preserve their margins, and are growing the top lines,""  Schuringa added.
Inflation will come into added focus next week, when the data is expected show the pace of core consumer prices, which excludes food and energy, slowed in January. 
""[B]ase effects will keep pushing y/y growth rates higher through Feb, but monthly increases could begin to decelerate as early as next week,"" Jefferies said in a note."
828,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>","Alzheimer's-like changes found in COVID patients' brains; flu shot, mRNA booster safe together","By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Alzheimer's-like changes seen in COVID-19 patients' brains
People who die of severe COVID-19 have brain abnormalities that resemble changes seen in Alzheimer's disease - accumulation of a protein called tau inside brain cells, and abnormal amounts of the protein beta-amyloid that accumulates into amyloid plaques - small studies have found.
At Columbia University, Dr. Andrew Marks and colleagues studied the brains of 10 COVID-19 patients and found defects in proteins called ryanodine receptors that control the passage of calcium into cells. In Alzheimer's disease, defective ryanodine receptors are linked to accumulation of tau into so-called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles were present in high levels in the COVID-19 patients' brains, the Columbia team reported on Thursday in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Other research teams have looked for - and found - abnormal amyloid levels in brains of COVID-19 patients, according to reports posted online ahead of peer review on bioRxiv and on The Lancet's preprint server. 
In all the studies, patients had experienced the most severe forms of COVID-19. If similar changes are occurring in the brains of patients with milder illness, that might help explain the ""brain fog"" associated with long COVID, Marks said. Patients with severe COVID-19 might be at higher risk for dementia later in life, but it is too soon to know, he added. His advice: Get a booster vaccine and avoid the virus. ""If you get COVID-19, you probably won't die, but we still don't know a lot about the long-term effects.""
Seniors can get flu shot, mRNA COVID-19 booster together
Seniors can safely get the high-dose flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster dose at the same time, a new study confirms.
The study's 306 participants, all older than 65, were randomly assigned either to receive  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine and a third shot of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s mRNA vaccine at the same time, or either of the vaccines alone. Blood samples obtained before and 21 days after vaccination showed that giving the two vaccines together did not affect the resulting immune response, with similar antibody levels generated in participants in each of the three groups, according to a report published on Tuesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.
A spokesperson for Sanofi said combined administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines ""did not raise any safety concerns and the study team is continuing to follow study participants through 6 months after vaccination."" 
Fluid in some rapid COVID tests could be deadly for kids
In some COVID-19 rapid test kits, the small bottle of ""reagent"" fluid contains sodium azide, a powerful poison that is particularly dangerous for small children, experts warn.
In adults, small amounts can quickly cause dangerously low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, or even heart attacks or strokes, said Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, Co-Medical Director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C. Higher doses can be fatal, she and her colleagues wrote in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Sodium azide levels in COVID-19 rapid test kits are not always high enough to cause low blood pressure in adults, and the iHealth kits being sent out by the U.S. government do not contain any sodium azide at all, Johnson-Arbor said. ""However... since children are typically much smaller than adults, they are at a higher risk of experiencing poisonous effects after swallowing any amount,"" she said.

Poison control hotlines have been getting reports of accidental exposures to the reagent fluid. ""Some people have swallowed the solution, some have spilled it onto their skin, and others have put it in their eyes,"" mistaking the bottle for eye drops, Johnson-Arbor said.

829,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 04:09PM ET</span>","The Gulf in January Jobs Reports Is Sign of ‘Abnormal Times,’ ADP Economist Says","(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street strategists had two wildly different pictures of the U.S. job market to weigh against each other this week. One, from the ADP Research Institute, showed the number of jobs tumbled in January. The other, from the U.S. Labor Department, that payrolls grew at a surprisingly rapid pace.
ADP’s report on Wednesday showed that companies cut more than 300,000 jobs during the first month of the year, while the government’s figures Friday showed businesses added nearly 450,000 new positions.
But that gap of more than 700,000 may not seem so stark when more numbers flow in, according to ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson. 
One source of the discrepancy, she said: the adjustments that the Labor Department makes to factor out seasonal changes in employment, an effort to make the monthly figures better depict the baseline trend of the economy. ADP also counts the number of people on active payrolls, whether they get a paycheck or not, she said, another difference from the government. 
“So those differences are small in normal times, and they’re a bit bigger in abnormal times, like we are in now,” she said on Bloomberg’s “QuickTake Stock” streaming program on Friday. “Over the course of several months, not necessarily one-month estimates, you do see a greater alignment.” 
But the near-term gulf underscored the heightened significance Wall Street is putting on economic indicators as it tries to gauge how aggressively the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year to keep the economy from overheating. 
Some analysts, economists and White House officials expected Friday’s Labor Department figures to echo the weakness reported by ADP, anticipating that the coronavirus surge would dampen employment growth at the start of the year. At TD Securities, for instance, economists predicted “downside risk” to their estimate of 200,000 jobs lost. Some estimates called for U.S. payrolls to decline by as much as 400,000.
As a result, the unexpected strength in January, with a broad-based gain of 467,000 in total nonfarm payrolls, which also includes government employment, caught markets by surprise, sending bond yields surging and causing traders to ratchet up wagers that the Fed will raise interest rates by as much as half a percentage point in March. It also showed a 709,000 upward revision to the prior two months. 
Richardson said that upward revision brought the Labor Department’s December estimate closer to ADP’s, which was far stronger than the government’s initial figures. 
“That story is still being written, frankly,” she said. “If you looked at the revisions from November to December, in December we looked off, too. It turns out we’re not as off as was originally reported because those numbers were revised up by so much in December.”

“The big story this month was the revisions,” said Richardson. “We thought it was going to be about worker absenteeism, taking time off for sick leave because of omicron. No -- it’s about the revisions and they were revised up substantially in November and December.” 
She added that Friday’s figure “shows the strength continued even as omicron surged, so it gives us some reflection on the pattern of job gains, not over the course of 2021, but heading into a new year.”

According to the report, the new iPhone will be the first update to the iPhone SE model in two years and will feature 5G network capabilities, an improved camera and a faster processor. 
Apple in October announced two new MacBook Pro models that run on more powerful in-house chips.
With the expected launch still more than a month away, Apple's plans may change in the face of production delays or other changes, the report added.

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Cupertino, California-based Apple is overcoming the costly global shortage in computer chips and posted record sales over the holiday quarter in January, beating profit estimates and forecasting that its shortfall is narrowing.

Investing.com — PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares have been under pressure for some time, falling 33% this year alone. The move lower was fueled further by Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings report, resulting in a 24% decline.
However, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said there were ""four silver linings that may have gone unnoticed.""
In a note to clients Friday, Dolev said that despite the ""epic de-rating"" of PayPal shares, the total payment value per user is continuing to improve. 
""Our analysis shows that PYPL's share price (lagged by one quarter) closely tracks incremental TPV per user,"" the analyst stated, adding that if the ""metric continues to improve, the stock is likely to follow.""
Dolev then pointed to the company's ex-eBay take rate — the rate it takes per transaction — stating it is improving at an accelerating pace, coming in at 2.03% in Q4, up from 1.98% in Q3 and 1.95% in Q2.
Furthermore, Dolev explained that incremental total payment value, excluding eBay, is accelerating and engagement is advancing ""very nicely,"" while incremental transactions per active account in Q4 were higher when compared to Q3. 
PayPal shares rose 1.6% Friday."

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday threw out a jury verdict ordering Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc to pay $1.1 billion to the California Institute of Technology for infringing its Wi-Fi technology patents, and ordered a new trial on damages.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the January 2020 award by the federal jury in Los Angeles, one of the largest ever in patent cases, was ""legally unsupportable.""
It also upheld the jury's findings that Apple and Broadcom infringed two Caltech patents, and ordered a new trial on whether they infringed a third patent.
Caltech had sued Apple and Broadcom in May 2016, alleging that millions of iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other devices using Broadcom chips infringed its data-transmission patents.
The jury had ordered Apple to pay Caltech $837.8 million and Broadcom to pay an additional $270.2 million.
Caltech spokeswoman Shayna Chabner said the Pasadena, California-based school was confident that the value of its patents would be ""fully recognized"" at a new damages trial.
Neither Apple nor Broadcom immediately responded to requests for comment.
Apple is a major purchaser of Broadcom chips, and in January 2020 reached a $15 billion supply agreement that ends in 2023. Broadcom has estimated that 20% of its revenue comes from Apple. 
Caltech's damages model had been based on an argument that the school could have simultaneously negotiated a license with Apple for devices containing Broadcom chips, and a license with Broadcom for chips used elsewhere.
Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Richard Linn rejected that theory.

""The mere fact that Broadcom and Apple are separate infringers alone does not support treating the same chips differently at different stages in the supply chain,"" Linn wrote. ""Caltech's two-tier damages theory is legally unsupportable on this record.""
Caltech has also sued  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) for alleged infringement of the same patents. Those cases are pending.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 turned positive Friday, aided by a rally in Amazon and an unexpectedly strong monthly jobs report that sent U.S. Treasury yields to two-year highs.  
The S&P 500 rose 1.10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.34%, or 120 points, the Nasdaq rallied 2.2%.
The U.S. economy created 467,000 jobs last month, well above the expectations for 150,000, led by job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, which confounded expectations that an omicron-impact would weigh on the services industry.
Average hourly earnings increased by a better than expected 0.7% for the month, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4%.
An unexpectedly strong number isn’t likely to change the Fed’s thinking on policy but may serve to drown out  “the ‘policy mistake’ narrative in the market that bubbled up as the Fed turned more hawkish in recent months,” Jefferies said in a note.
U.S. yields surged on expectations for more aggressive Fed action, with the U.S. 10-year yield jumping above 1.9% for the first time in two years.
Tech climbed out of early-day trouble against the backdrop of rising rates as surge in Amazon restored sentiment on growth somewhat after Meta’s plunge a day earlier.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied more than 15% following better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and fiscal first quarter guidance.
The bulk of earnings beat was led by gains from the company’s Rivian stake, but better than feared Q1 guidance and the move to hike the annual price of U.S. Prime subscriptions to offset costs also helped boost investor sentiment.
“Amazon’s profitability should expand as it grows opex more slowly than revenues. Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and ads should drive steady margin expansion, with Prime memberships driving overall retail revenue growth,” Wedbush said in a note.
Other megacap stocks including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were off their session lows, underpinned the move higher in the broader market.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP), meanwhile, jumped more than 60% following quarterly results that topped expectations,
The wild swings in markets recently, however, is expected to continue, and likely sets up rocky road for the weeks ahead until there is more certainty about the path of inflation and the Fed’s plan to tighten monetary policy.
“Volatility generally means bear markets … the fact that we've seen a spike in volatility doesn't bode well for overall markets,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday. Volatility is set to continue until  “some of these other factors, primarily the Fed and inflation, settle down.”
Portfolio positioning would be best served by companies ""that are actually able to pass on price increases to preserve their margins, and are growing the top lines,”  "

(Reuters) -Growth and technology stocks rebounded on Friday, as traders weighed stellar results from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) against an unexpectedly strong U.S. employment number that propelled Treasury yields higher.
The Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavy on tech and other growth stocks, was recently jumping about 2% a day after a historic crash in shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms wiped $200 billion from the company’s market value and weighed on broader markets after its earnings disappointed Wall Street.
Shares of Amazon, which delighted investors by hiking its Prime subscription rate, were recently up over 15%, on track to increase its market value by more than $200 billion.
Shares of social media platform  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) rose more than 50%, after tumbling by a quarter in the previous session.
The fourth-quarter earnings season has been mixed for growth and tech companies, with bitter disappointments from such players as Meta, streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and fintech PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) partially offset by uplifting results from Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
While many of the big tech-focused stocks are often thought of as a single group, ""the divergence between Amazon and Meta Platforms' earnings is an important reminder that each company is unique with its own set of problems and opportunities,"" wrote Julian Koski, chief investment officer of asset management firm New Age Alpha in a note to investors.
""The best stocks are those that deliver the growth that is implied in their stock price, no matter what group or category the stock may be part of,"" he said.
Investors were also digesting Friday's robust jobs report, which fueled a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in more than two years. Higher yields tend to weigh on growth stocks as they threaten to erode the value of companies' future earnings.
The recent gyrations have attracted retail buyers. Thursday's net purchases of Meta's shares by retail investors hit $231 million, a 3-1/2 year high according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, marking it the third biggest day of net purchases since January 2014.
WILD SWINGS
Diverging earnings from megacap growth stocks are fueling wild swings in equities, opening the door for more volatility on the heels of last month's sharp drop as investors grow more discerning in the names they pick.
Many investors started trimming holdings of tech stocks even before the earnings season kicked off as future earnings growth promised by the sector loses its appeal when central banks raise rates, increasing the immediate financial rewards of holding risk-free government bonds.
Some banks have been recommending rotating portfolios towards stocks that do well when inflation and bond yields rise, such as banks, insurers, miners and oil companies, ever since the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged it would start raising rates from next month.
""A tightening Fed historically brings lower returns and great uncertainty for equities,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote Friday. The bank said they ""remain sellers of rallies"" and believe the S&P 500's fair value is closer to 4,000. The benchmark index was recently up around 0.9% at 4,518.
Others, however, believe the big picture for tech stocks is far from bleak.

""Overall, the earnings outlook is still solid, with the global tech sector on track for earnings growth of around 15%,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients.
""In our base case, we expect valuations to stabilize and for strong mid-teens earnings growth to be reflected in share prices over the next 12 months.""

836,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 02:20PM ET</span>",Hacking team tied to Russia targeted Western 'government entity' in Ukraine -researchers,"By James Pearson and Christopher Bing
(Reuters) -A hacking team that Ukraine says is controlled by Russian intelligence has targeted a wide range of organizations in the country, including a ""western government entity,"" according to cybersecurity research published on Thursday and Friday.
The United States and other allies have sent military advisers and cybersecurity experts to Ukraine in recent months to help defend against Russian forces, now massed on the neighboring country's borders. 
In a report issued on Friday,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said a group called ""Gameredon"" had tried to obtain sensitive information from a wide range of military, governmental and nongovernmental organizations in Ukraine since last October.
The report included a screen shot of one such attempt, which showed an email, embedded with malicious code, disguised as an official update on the COVID-19 pandemic from the World Health Organization (WHO).
On Thursday, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Inc said in its report that Gamaredon attacked a Western government entity in Ukraine in January. The report did not name the entity, and a company representative declined to comment further.
Palo Alto Networks said it was able to track the Russian hacking mission by analyzing a maze of different malicious Web domains designed to infect Ukrainian computers with malware. 
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, prompting fears of war. Although denying it plans an invasion, Russia is demanding sweeping security guarantees including a promise that NATO never admit Ukraine.
In November, Ukrainian security services publicly attributed Gamaredon to a team of Russian Federal Security Service officers based in Crimea. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Gameredon.
“They were officers of the ‘Crimean’ FSB, as well as traitors who sided with the enemy during the occupation of the peninsula in 2014,” Ukraine's security service said in a November https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy news release, publicizing leaked audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rci5xiyMv7k&feature=emb_title of the hackers. 
Also known as Primitive Bear by security researchers, Gamaredon is one of the most ""active existing advanced persistent threats targeting Ukraine,"" the Palo Alto report said. 
""Given the steps and precision delivery involved in this campaign, it appears this may have been a specific, deliberate attempt"" to target a ""Western government organization,"" a Palo Alto Networks spokesperson said in a statement.
A NATO spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Russia could use cyberattacks as part of its efforts to destabilize and further invade Ukraine, White House cyber official Anne Neuberger said on Wednesday, during a visit to her European counterparts. 
Neuberger's visit came just weeks after a different cyberattack against Ukrainian government websites left a warning to visitors: ""be afraid and expect the worst.""

Last month, activist investor Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research Corp offered to buy the department-store chain for $64 a share, valuing it at roughly $9 billion.
Around the same time, sources told Reuters that Sycamore Partners was also preparing an all-cash offer for Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) at $65 per share.
Without naming its suitors, Kohl's said on Thursday the offers did not adequately reflect its future growth and cash flow generation. It has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to engage in talks with interested parties about a potential sale.
Activist investors Macellum Advisors and Engine Capital, unhappy with Kohl's performance, have been pressuring it to explore options including a sale. 
Macellum, which owns nearly 5% of Kohl's stock, said it was ""disappointed and shocked"" by the company's decision. It added that the board is taking ""unprecedented"" steps to douse growing takeover interest.
Shares of the company rose 1%, adding on to a 25% gain over the past two weeks on news of the offers. It had a market value of $8.15 billion as of Thursday's close, according to Refinitiv.
Morningstar analysts said it is ""risky"" to reject credible offers, especially after unfavorable market conditions for Kohl's in 2021. 
Sycamore declined to comment and Acacia did not respond to a request for comment.

The company also said the shareholder rights plan, popularly known as a ""poison pill"", expires in February 2023. The rights will be exercisable if a person or group, other than passive institutional investors, acquires a stake of 10% or more.
Poison pills make a proposed takeover more expensive or difficult by allowing existing shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount, diluting a hostile suitor's ownership stake.

Investing.com —  ManTech International  (NASDAQ:MANT) shares rallied 6.9% Friday following upgrades by analysts at William Blair and BofA. The upgrades come on the back of reports Thursday that co-founder George Pedersen is exploring options for the sale of his controlling stake.
Rumors and reports swirled that a sale of the defense contracting firm is being explored, with private equity firms and strategic buyers contacted by investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Reports from StreetInsider stated Pederson — aged 86, who owns all 13.2 million Class B shares outstanding and controls approximately 83% of the voting power, is considering his options as the shares won't have voting control should he pass away.
The news prompted BofA analyst Mariana Perez Mora to double upgrade the shares from underperform to buy, increasing the firm's price target to $90 from $75. Mora said the dual-class ownership structure had limited ManTech's upside. However, Pederson's change in approach ""opens meaningful strategic options for the company that before were not possible, more than offsetting near term headwinds from slow defense/intel award environment, higher than normal re-compete risk, and lower than anticipated win rate within federal civil."" 
In addition, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma upgraded the stock to outperform. As well as the potential sale, the analyst cited the company's two recent Navy contract wins as reasons for the re-rating. DiPalma said with shares now at $75, the risk-to-reward looks favorable."

(Reuters) -Delta Air Lines wants the U.S. government to place passengers convicted of on-board disruptions on a national ""no-fly"" list that would bar them from future travel on any commercial airline, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian, in a previously unreported letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, said the action ""will help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft.""
The request comes amid a record spike in disruptive passengers reported over the last 13 months. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
In November, Garland directed federal prosecutors to prioritize prosecution of airline passengers committing assaults and other crimes aboard aircraft.
Delta noted there is currently a no-fly list that is a subset of the terrorism watch list that allows the U.S. government to prohibit persons considered a threat to civil aviation from traveling on airlines.
The Federal Aviation Administration said last year it had taken a ""zero tolerance"" approach and referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Bastian said Delta has placed nearly 1,900 people on Delta’s “no-fly” list for refusing to comply with masking requirements and submitted more than 900 banned names to the Transportation Security Administration to pursue civil penalties.
Delta previously called on other airlines to share their unruly passenger “no fly” list to ensure individuals ""who have endangered the safety and security of our people do not go on to do so on another carrier,"" Bastian wrote.

Last month, three New York residents were charged with assaulting a Delta security officer at JFK Airport in September. The three were charged with ""viciously assaulted an airline security officer by beating him to the floor with his radio and then kicking and punching him in the face and body while he was down,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said last month.
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he had instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.

Carlyle has prevailed in an auction to acquire New York-based CBAM, which manages $15 billion in credit assets, such as collateralized loan obligations and structured credit products, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
Bloomberg News reported earlier that Carlyle was in advanced talks to acquire CBAM for between $750 million to $850 million. Carlyle and CBAM spokespeople declined to comment.
With its roots in leveraged buyouts, Carlyle has been trying to expand its credit platform in recent years. It hired veteran credit executive Mark Jenkins from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) in 2016 to spearhead its expansion into the private credit market. 

The Washington, D.C.-based firm grew its credit assets to $73 billion as of the end of December, up from $34 billion when Jenkins joined, through a mixture of fundraising and acquisitions of other firms.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Europe's Airbus and Quebec on Friday said they have agreed to a $1.2 billion investment deal that would allow the Canadian province to remain in the loss-making A220 jet program until the venture is likely to turn profitable.
Airbus would invest $900 mln, while Quebec would put $300 million into the program, according to a statement from the province's government.
The investment would help the A220 program globally to support an increase in production, Benoit Schultz, chief executive of Airbus' Canadian unit, told a press briefing. The A220 is built both at an Airbus plant in the Montreal area and at the Mobile facility in Alabama.
The A220, previously known as the CSeries, is a 110- to 130-seater aircraft, a little smaller than Airbus’s mainstay A320 jet. Reuters reported on the deal earlier, citing sources.
The province has faced criticism for repeated investments in the program.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the program should be profitable by the middle of the decade.
Faury told reporters that COVID-19 weighed on cost-cutting efforts because it impeded production increases.
""We need volume to have these savings,"" he said.
Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said the A220 program has promise to turn the corner and generates key jobs for the province, Canada's aerospace hub.
The deal would help maintain the equivalent of 2,500 jobs. 
The deal would defer by four years the period when Airbus buys out Quebec's 25% stake in the small jetliner from 2026 to 2030, and Fitzgibbon said that could be advantageous.
""At that time we're going to have a fair market value assessment and I'm very hopeful we're going to make money and recuperate the original investment,"" he said.
While the A220 has benefited from airlines' preference for relatively small jets during the pandemic, Airbus has yet to secure low enough prices for many of the plane's components to push the A220 project into the black.

Airbus was expected to use its global marketing network and higher purchasing power from suppliers to move the project into the black, but while sales have soared, industry sources say it has struggled to win the concessions it wants from suppliers.
In 2020, Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) exited the program, the first all-new narrow-body jet in 30 years, after it was beset with delays and cost overruns.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping opened a Beijing Winter Olympics on Friday that not only bear the mark of the global coronavirus pandemic but are also mixing sport and global politics as few others have since the era of the Cold War.
The scintillating opening ceremony ended with a member of China's Uyghur minority - whose treatment is the focus of international human rights criticism - helping to light the Olympic cauldron, hours after Xi announced a new strategic alliance with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Three thousand performers took to a stage comprising 11,600 sq metres of high-definition LED screens in the famed Bird's Nest stadium, before a crowd thinned out by COVID-19 restrictions.
Dancers poured in waving glowing green stalks to mark the first day of spring on the Chinese calendar, followed by an explosion of white and green fireworks that spelled the word ""Spring"".
On a three-dimensional cube resembling a block of ice, lasers carved figures from each of the previous 23 Winter Games. The block was then ""broken"" by ice hockey players, enabling the Olympic rings to emerge, all in white.
The lighting of the stadium cauldron by the last athlete in the torch relay, their identity kept secret until the last moment, usually provides the climax at the end of the Olympic opening ceremony, and this one proved especially significant.
Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a 20-year-old cross-country skier born in Altay in the western Xinjiang region, lit the flame along with Nordic combined athlete Zhao Jiawen.
China's treatment of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang - which Washington deems genocide - was the trigger for a diplomatic boycott by several Western countries including the United States.
ETHNIC GROUPS
China rejects allegations of human rights abuses and sought to convey a spirit of inclusion during the ceremony, in which the Chinese flag was passed among 56 people representing its ethnic groups before being raised for the national anthem.
The ceremony was staged by movie director Zhang Yimou, reprising his role from Beijing's 2008 Summer Games triumph.
But as in Japan half a year ago, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed severe constraints, not least by paring down the number of visitors able to see the spectacle in person.
With China still sticking to a ""zero Covid"" policy despite the Omicron variant spreading fast across the globe, organisers decided last month not to sell tickets to the public, kept outside a ""closed loop"" of competitors and other personnel.
Though smaller in scale than the 2008 Games - dubbed China's ""coming out party"" - the Beijing Winter Olympics are being staged by a China that is much more prosperous, powerful, confident and confrontational under Xi.
Hours before they began, Xi and Putin unveiled their alliance, proclaiming a ""no limits"" friendship between their countries.
It was a stark reminder of a backdrop of geopolitical rivalry unseen since the tit-for-tat Cold War boycotts of the 1980s, when the United States refused to attend the Olympics in Moscow and the Soviet Union stayed away from Los Angeles.
With tensions on both sides of the Eurasian land mass at their highest for decades, Putin and Xi publicly took each other's sides over a range of grievances, most notably Ukraine, where the West accuses Putin of preparing for war. 
MUTUAL SUPPORT
The Russian leader - who hosted his own Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014, days before sending troops to seize Ukraine's Crimean peninsula - thanked Xi for inviting him, adding: ""We know first-hand that this is a huge job.""
In a joint Russian-Chinese statement, Beijing backed Russia's longstanding call for NATO to halt its expansion - Moscow's central demand in a dispute with Western countries that say they believe Putin is preparing for war in Ukraine.
Russia, which has deployed more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian frontier, denies planning to invade but says it could take unspecified military action unless its security demands are met.
Moscow, for its part, said it fully supported Beijing's stance on Taiwan and opposed Taiwanese independence in any form.
International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach urged the world's political leaders to observe an ""Olympic truce"" and ""give peace a chance"".
But political leaders from the United States and other Western countries were absent, having cited persecution of the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, which Beijing denies.
Rights groups accuse China of torture, forced labour and detention of 1 million people in internment camps in Xinjiang.
China calls them re-education and training facilities, says it is fighting religious extremism, and denies abuses.

""By selecting a Uyghur athlete to light the torch, China is trying to address criticism by the West about genocide or persecution of the Uyghurs, and about sinocisation of ethnic minorities,"" said Ma Haiyun, an expert on Xinjiang and an associate professor at Frostburg State University in Maryland.
""But I don't think this can have much effect on the West, which tends to think most of what China puts up is a show anyway.""

Investing.com – Skechers (NYSE:SKX) shares traded nearly 7% higher Friday as the company’s fourth-quarter numbers suggested sustained demand for casual and comfortable shoes.
The company reported record revenue each quarter in 2021, riding on the pandemic-created shift to casual footwear that people wore both at home and outside.
“Fourth quarter growth was driven by increases of 30% in both our international wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, and 5% in domestic wholesale,” Chief Operating Officer David Weinberg said in a company statement.
Improvements in the domestic wholesale business were the result of increase in volumes and higher average selling prices, and especially notable given the supply chain issues that have slowed the footwear industry.
Internationally, United Kingdom, India and Spain were among markets that recorded double-digit growth. China grew in high single-digits. Direct-to-consumer business benefited from reduced promotions and higher prices.
Overall, October-December sales rose more than 24% year-on-year to $1.65 billion. Gross margin fell a tad to 48.6% on higher freight costs. Operating and general expenses rose due to higher marketing costs, bigger compensation to staff, increased volume-driven warehouse and distribution expenses, and the settlement of multiple legal matters.
Adjusted profit per share was 43 cents and beat estimates.
The company is forecasting current-year sales of $7 billion-$7.2 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2021. Diluted profit per share for the year is seen at $2.80 at midpoint of its guidance range.
Current-quarter diluted EPS is seen between 70 cents and 75 cents on sales of $1.67 billion-$1.72 billion."

Investing.com – Unity Software stock (NYSE:U) soared 15.9% in Friday trading after the gaming-engine company said its strong sales will continue in the current year as well, riding on “strong tailwinds” as clients transition to real-time 3D content.
Unity’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 43% to $316 million. Loss from operations widened to $144.8 million in the fourth quarter due to higher stock-based compensation expenses.
The company said its 2022 revenue could reach $1.5 billion, 36% growth on top of last year's growth of 44% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted loss from operations is seen narrowing to $40 million at center of its guidance range for the year.
In the year gone by, Unity added key capabilities and expanded its addressable market with acquisitions. Rising popularity of cross-platform and multiplayer games helped. More clients used its software to monetize their games. Outside of gaming, companies like Hyundai and eBay used its RT3D capabilities to drive productivity.
Number of customers generating more than $100,000 in revenue in the year rose to 1,052 compared to 793 in the previous trailing 12 months, the company said.
The company expects current-quarter revenue to come in between $315 million and $320 million, up 34%-36%. Adjusted loss from operations for the period is seen at $22 million-$23 million."

(Reuters) -The chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Friday asked the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to reverse course and buy a cleaner fleet of next-generation delivery vehicles.
The push by Senator Tom Carper comes two days after the White House and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urged USPS to reconsider its plan to buy a new multibillion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles. 
Carper said in a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy USPS should complete a supplemental environmental impact review ""and adopt an approach that will result in a cleaner, more cost-effective, and more sustainable postal fleet.""
The EPA Wednesday urged USPS to hold a new hearing on its 10-year contract with Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp awarded in February 2021 that could be worth $6 billion or more to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles. USPS rejected a proposal from electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group.
Environmental groups have sharply criticized USPS's plan.
Carper said if USPS proceeds ""it will be taking action that is not only unwise, but will also expose the service to significant legal jeopardy.""
USPS did not immediately comment on Carper's letter but said Wednesday it believed it was in compliance with environmental review requirements and must focus on USPS's ""financial sustainability.""
Oshkosh Defense President John Bryant declined to comment on questions about the environmental impact review but said in a statement the company could ""produce any mix of BEV (electric vehicle) and ICE (NYSE:ICE) (combustion engine) vehicles, up to 100% BEVs, that the USPS wants.""
DeJoy has said the agency was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet.
The EPA said USPS' proposed new gas-powered vehicles ""are expected to achieve only 8.6 miles per gallon (mpg), barely improving over the decades old long-life vehicles that achieve 8.2 mpg.""

President Joe Biden's spending and climate bill would award $6 billion for USPS to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. 
The United Auto Workers union has criticized Oshkosh for building the vehicles in South Carolina rather than at a union-represented facility in Wisconsin and urged a new review of the contract on environmental grounds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is taking another stab at investing in ""disruptive innovation,"" this time through a new fund that will target illiquid securities including those of private companies, a regulatory filing on Thursday showed.
Wood, known for managing ARK Innovation, the firm's flagship exchange-traded fund, filed for an interval fund that would expand the firm's reach to allow it to invest in ""disruptive innovation"" in securities of firms that might not have a secondary market, the filing said.
An interval fund is a closed-end mutual fund that does not trade on an exchange and only allows investors to redeem shares at particular intervals and in limited quantities.
The filing comes at a time when the ARK Innovation ETF, which bested all other U.S. equity funds in 2020, has slumped about 55% from its year-ago record high amid a rotation out of growth and technology stocks.
The new fund's investments will include early- to late-stage private companies engaged in introduction of technologically enabled new products or services that ""potentially changes the way the world works,"" the filing said.
The fund, which will have a minimum initial investment threshold of $1,000, will look to invest in firms involved in a wide range of areas including artificial intelligence and automation, the filing said. 
The fund will only offer redemptions of between 5% and 25% of the fund's shares just once a quarter, the filing said. Such restrictions are a common way to get around the problems expected due to the illiquid nature of these types of securities.
""ARK has a strong following with investors that can help to raise awareness,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.
""But the limited demand for their latest ETF, CTRU, highlights the challenge to gather assets during a recent period of underperformance,"" he said. 

The socially focused ARK Transparency ETF, launched in early December, has had a lukewarm reception from investors and is down 19% from its Dec. 8 market debut price.
""There's likely to be interest in the interval fund, but since it structured differently than an ETF it might require more education,"" Rosenbluth said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) said it still expected its COVID-19 vaccine to complete phase 3 trial in the first quarter and reported a rise in fourth-quarter sales and earnings on Friday.
The group, which is hoping for a comeback after losing ground in the COVID-19 jab race, also said it was aiming for an increase in its earnings per share in the ""low double-digit"" in 2022.
Its sales in the three months to December grew 4.1% to 9.99 billion euros ($11.45 billion) while its EPS came in at 1.38 euros, compared with 1.22 euros in the same quarter last year. 
For the whole of 2021, its earnings per share rose by 15.5% at constant exchange rates, while the company had guided for a rise of 14%.
Despite being one of the biggest makers of vaccines in the world by sales before the COVID-19 pandemic, Sanofi was beaten by newcomers who used newer mRNA technology to immunize people against coronavirus.
It is instead focusing on efforts with British partner GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the more conventional protein-based approach, where mass trials are ongoing.
The two partners had initially targeted approval in the first half of 2021, which was later delayed to the end of the year and in December, they again pushed back the expected approval to the first quarter of 2022.
On Friday, Sanofi's chief financial officer said it still expected the vaccine's phase 3 trial to be completed in the first quarter.
    ""There is no update today. We said that it should happen during Q1 of this year,"" Jean-Baptiste Chasseloup de Chatillon told reporters. 
Consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) offered 50 billion pounds last month for the consumer healthcare business of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline but declined to raise its bid when GSK sought a higher price.
De Chatillon said he expected ""some consolidation"" in the pharmaceutical sector following this attempt but that Sanofi would not be part of it. Sanofi is planning to separate its own consumer healthcare unit by the end of 2022.

""We are not in that game,"" De Chatillon said, adding that the company's focus was on growing the value of that division. 
(The story corrects headline, bullet point, 1st, 8th and 9th paras to show Sanofi expects its vaccine's phase 3 trial to finish in Q1 (not win approval for vaccine in Q1). Also corrects headline, 1st para to show it did not say vaccine would drive earnings in 2022)

851,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 11:47AM ET</span>","Analysis-Digital ad minnows Snap, Pinterest soar past giant Meta","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - For years, investors have wondered about the long-term prospects for  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc, smaller digital ad players which have had to pick up the ad dollar scraps left over from giant tech rivals.
This week, David triumphed over Goliath as Snap and Pinterest reported financial results that demonstrated how their smaller size, different advertiser base and relatively newer ad operations have helped them avoid the brunt of blows from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s decision to require apps to ask iOS users for permission to collect certain data. 
On Thursday, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc had more than $200 billion knocked off its market cap a day after it blamed Apple's changes for hurting fourth quarter results. While shares of Snap and Pinterest were initially dragged down by Meta's report, their shares skyrocketed 55% and 20%, respectively, late on Thursday after they showed ad revenue strength. 
Apple's privacy updates, called App Tracking Transparency, began rolling out to its iOS devices in April and gave users the option to block apps from tracking activity across apps and websites owned by other companies.
Snap said that by the end of the fourth quarter, many of its advertisers had adopted a tool provided by Apple to measure the effectiveness of ads, and had grown more comfortable using the tool. Advertisers representing 75% of revenue in its business that is geared toward driving sales or other customer actions from ads, had adopted a separate product created by Snap to measure the results of their ads. 
That helped Snap's ad business recover from the Apple changes ""quicker than we anticipated,"" said Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen during a call with analysts on Thursday.
The company, which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, began working more than a year ago to figure out how to target ads to users ""in a privacy-safe way,"" which helped Snap make progress before the Apple data-tracking changes upended the market, Andersen said.
Snap was also likely helped by the fact that the majority of its advertisers are large brands with marketing resources that allow them to quickly adapt to industry changes, while Meta's advertisers are predominantly small to medium-sized businesses that were not as quick to adjust to these changes, said LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield, in a CNBC interview on Thursday. 
When  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) reports next Thursday, the company is expected to underscore the trend that has propelled Snap's results against the seismic changes from Apple. Analysts expect the social networking site to be somewhat insulated from Apple because it is primarily used by advertisers to reach audiences around live and current events, and has been less reliant on the Apple device identifiers for advertisers.
In April, Twitter said its integration with Apple's ad measurement tool called SKAdNetwork, actually led to a 30% increase in Apple devices that Twitter could target ads to.

Digital pinboard company Pinterest said it was investing in video features and creator-led content to boost engagement and ad revenue.
Pinterest's Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said in an interview with Bloomberg that the company has not seen a material impact from Apple's changes, but that it could in the future.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) said on Friday its fourth-quarter profit surged 90%, topping Wall Street estimates on higher transaction volumes, notably in options, and lower-than-expected expenses.
Cboe, which provides trading platforms and products in equities, derivatives and foreign exchange across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, said net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $165.3 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in the quarter ended Dec. 31. That compares to $87.1 million, or 81 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.
""Our results were driven by higher volumes across our businesses, coupled with increased demand from our suite of data and access solutions,"" Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on a conference call after the earnings were released. 
Options revenues grew 25%, driven largely by higher trading volumes in the Chicago-based company's proprietary products, which include options linked to the VIX volatility index, and the S&P 500. VIX futures average daily volumes surged 50%, it said.
In January, with market volatility rising and expectations for interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, Cboe's VIX futures volumes jumped 31% from a year earlier, VIX options rose 24% and SPX options were up 17%, the company said.
Net revenue rose 27% to 390.5 million.
Excluding one-time items, like M&A costs, Cboe earned $1.70 per diluted share, topping the mean estimate of analysts by 17 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The beat was driven by higher-than-expected transaction fees and lower-than-expected expenses, said Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon.

However, Cboe's 2022 expense forecast of $617 million to $625 million was above consensus estimates, Fannon said in a client note.

(Reuters) -During the opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Olympics on Friday, hosts and experts on U.S. network NBC spoke in stark terms about China's alleged rights violations and Russia's conflict with Ukraine, directly addressing the geopolitical tensions underpinning the Games.
Coverage of the political backdrop comes as human rights groups and lawmakers have pressured NBC and broadcasters around the world to incorporate China's treatment of minority Muslim Uyghurs and crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong into the coverage of the Olympics.
NBC featured China experts who discussed the status of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in China's northwest region of Xinjiang, among other controversies facing the host country. 
Those experts joined host Mike Tirico in an interview from the opening ceremony stadium. Savannah Guthrie co-hosted the broadcast from NBC Sports headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
The opening ceremony culminated with Uyghur cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang lighting the Olympic cauldron, a ""stunning decision,"" by the host nation as other countries have deemed China's treatment of the Uyghurs to be genocide, Guthrie said.
""It's so striking and so provocative by (Chinese president) Xi Jinping, and a real message,"" Guthrie said.
China denies allegations of genocide or other human rights abuses, and says its camps in Xinjiang provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Throughout the opening ceremony, NBC turned to experts to explain the gravity of Western governments' and human rights groups' allegations against China for its treatment of ethnic minorities.
""They allege that this is a massive program of social engineering aimed at suppressing Muslim Uyghur culture, language, tradition, identity,"" said Andy Browne, editorial director of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum and one of two China experts hired by NBC for its broadcast. ""They allege a host of human rights abuses, forced labor, coercive birth control practices, indoctrination, and that this all adds up to a form of cultural genocide.""
NBC also showed Russian President Vladimir Putin in the stands of the Beijing stadium as the commentators discussed the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has led to fears of war in the region.
The United States and many Western nations staged a diplomatic boycott of the Games, declining to send political delegations to the opening. That stands in sharp contrast to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, which were attended by U.S. President George Bush.
Human rights advocates have shone a spotlight on NBC's coverage because the network's contract to air the Olympics is by far the world's largest. In 2014, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal paid $7.65 billion to extend its exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights for the Olympics through 2032. 

Rights and press freedom groups have voiced concerns about the ability of NBC and journalists in general to freely report during the Olympics, citing Beijing's clampdowns. 
In a presentation to reporters last month, NBC said its broadcast coverage of the Games would include the ""geopolitical context"" of China as the host nation.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Carlsberg plans to raise beer prices to offset rising raw material costs, potentially hitting beer sales this year, the Danish brewer said on Friday.
The world's third-largest brewer reported better than forecast fourth-quarter sales on Friday but said it expects organic growth in operating profit this year to fall short of last year's level.
""The significantly higher input costs and continued impact from COVID-19 will pose challenges in 2022,"" Chief Executive Cees 't Hart said. 
Costs per hectolitre rose by 10-12% last year, driven by higher commodity and transportation prices, he said, adding that the company aims to offset the increased costs by raising prices, though this could have ""a negative impact on beer consumption"". 
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) expects organic operating profit to grow by 0-7% in 2022, compared with 12.5% last year.
""We're looking into a different situation this year, and therefore we have a relatively broad range on our financial guidance,"" the CEO said.
The company had said on Thursday that it would look for growth beyond its core beer market over the next five years to focus on categories such as cider, seltzers and alcohol-free beer, as well as premium brands such as 1665 Blanc and Grimbergen, which it says generate higher profit margins.
Sales in the fourth quarter reached 15.2 billion Danish crowns ($2.34 billion), against 14.7 billion crowns estimated by analysts in a company poll.
Carlsberg said it would propose a dividend of 24 crowns per share, or 3.4 billion crowns in total, up 9% year on year. 

The company also launched a 1 billion crown share buyback programme running until April 22.

(Reuters) - Facebook's parent Meta Platforms said on Friday it is launching a tool for people using its virtual reality social platforms to maintain personal space boundaries, as concerns have mounted about user safety and sexual harassment in the metaverse.
Its new ""personal boundary"" tool will make users feel like they have nearly four feet (1.2 meters) between their virtual avatar and others when they access the immersive Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues apps through VR headsets. 
The company said in a blog post that this new default setting would make it easier to avoid unwanted interactions. The change comes as users of VR platforms including Horizon Worlds have raised alarms about virtual groping and other abusive behavior.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name to Meta, and has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play. 
Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.
Shares of Meta, which is pouring billions of dollars into its metaverse ambitions, plummeted 26% on Thursday in the biggest single-day slide in market value for a U.S. company, after the social media giant issued a dismal forecast, blaming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes and increased competition.
The company has long been under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators over its handling of problematic content and abuses on its existing social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
Meta said the new tool built on its current ""hand harassment measures,"" where an avatar's hands would disappear if they invaded someone's personal space. It also currently has a ""Safe Zone"" feature where people can activate a bubble around their avatar if they feel threatened.
Meta's vice president of Horizon Vivek Sharma said in the blog that the company believed the new personal boundaries would help set ""behavioral norms."" 
""It's an important step, and there's still much more work to be done. We'll continue to test and explore new ways to help people feel comfortable in VR,"" said Sharma. 

He said in the future, Meta would look at the possibility of adding in controls like letting people change the size of their personal boundary. 
For now, the company noted users will have to ""extend their arms to be able to high-five or fist bump other people's avatars.""

(Reuters) -Cruise operator  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group said on Friday the lightning spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant would delay its return to profitability by a few months, another blow for one of the companies worst affected by the pandemic.
The bleak prediction, as well as a larger-than-expected quarterly loss, sent Royal Caribbean's stock down 4% and also weighed on shares of rivals Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. 
The Omicron surge has in recent months forced cruise operators to change their trip itineraries and even cancel voyages, stalling a nascent recovery in the sector whose ships have spent most of the pandemic anchored at U.S. ports.
""The timing of Omicron was particularly painful as a typical wave booking period begins in early January,"" Chief Executive Officer Jason Liberty said on an earnings call.
The Celebrity Cruises owner expects a loss for the first half of 2022 before turning profitable in the following six months. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had estimated a loss for the first quarter and a return to profits in the second.
""(A recovery is) just going to continue to get pushed out and we're going to have delays and starts and stops until we are all clear of the pandemic,"" said Ivan Feinseth, the chief investment officer of Tigress Financial Partners.
The resurgence in COVID-19 cases has prompted a warning against cruise travel from the U.S. health agency and forced even frequent cruise passengers to stay away from voyages.

In the fourth quarter, total revenue came in at $982.2 million, missing analysts' estimates of $1.04 billion. The adjusted per-share loss of $4.78 was also larger than expectations of $3.92.
But in a bright spot, Royal Caribbean said bookings had picked up in late January and returned to pre-Omicron levels, with cancellations also subsiding.

Investing.com — Fisker Inc (NYSE:FSR) shares moved higher as it announced Friday it will be unveiling its Ocean all-electric SUV in Europe at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
The Fisker Ocean has a range of 250 miles with a starting price of $37,499. Delays have prevented the Ocean vehicles from reaching the market: they were initially due to start production in late 2021 or early this year, but that has now been pushed back to November 2022. 
In today's press release, the company said deliveries will begin in certain European countries and North America once production begins in over 8 months.
Fisker recently opened a European office in Munich and is building a brand experience center in Germany. 
""Europe is essential to our company as we work toward the start of production in November at a carbon-neutral factory in Austria,"" said Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker.
""We aim to make the world's most sustainable vehicle and to start deliveries in Europe this year. Ultimately, we expect to sell 60,000 units annually in the region,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Advent International is looking to sell its French biometrics and fingerprint identification firm IDEMIA in a deal worth up to $4.6 billion as it seeks to capitalise on growing demand for cybersecurity assets in Europe, two sources told Reuters.
The U.S. buyout fund is reviewing a series of options to sell IDEMIA, including a possible break-up of the company which was formed in 2016 by combining  Safran  (PA:SAF)'s identity and security business with Oberthur Technologies, the sources said.
The move comes as governments around the world have stepped up their data protection defences during the pandemic due to the increased threat of cyberattacks while companies are vying to provide identification services to their clients.
Cybercrime worldwide has jumped 600% during the pandemic, according to research published by Embroker, as hackers are upping their game and developing new malware to attack and infiltrate systems with the shift to remote working. 
IDEMIA, which is also backed by Bpifrance, provides facial recognition and other biometric identification products as well as ID tools for border control, working closely with government agencies to verify travellers' identity and avoid irregular immigration.
Advent has asked investment banks to pitch for a mandate as it wants to launch an auction process later this year, the first source said.
The sale, which is valued at 3 billion to 4 billion euros ($4.59 billion), has already drawn interest from France's defence firm Thales which could only bid for parts of IDEMIA due to antitrust hurdles, the sources said.
Thales said this week that it was ""potentially interested"" in any cyber-security asset that could be up for sale, stressing it would not diversify beyond its three core businesses of aerospace, defence and digital identity and security.
Private equity firms are also keen to join the race for IDEMIA, which is based on the outskirts of Paris, but no deal or pre-emptive approach is expected to come before the French election in April, the sources said.
A spokesperson for Advent declined to comment. 
Thales declined to comment.
BREAK-UP?
IDEMIA, which underwent a 2020 leadership change when Pierre Barrial stepped in as CEO, has benefited from the post-pandemic rebound but is still carrying a heavy debt load and its key credit metrics remain weak, according to rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
It reported core earnings of 360 million euros in 2020 and overall revenues of about 2 billion euros, the first source said.
To fetch the highest price Advent could carve out IDEMIA's prized government business, valued at about 3 billion euros, and sell it separately from its enterprise operations which provide sim cards for mobile phones and payments platforms and could be worth about 1 billion euros, the sources said.
Thales is waiting in the wings as it wants to bulk on cybersecurity but would struggle to swallow IDEMIA's enterprise assets due to the overlap in sim-card supply following its purchase of Dutch firm  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) in 2019, the first source said. 

The French defence group, which is controlled by Dassault Aviation and the French state, has eyed a similar move for Atos' cybersecurity business, known as BDS, but would need support from the government for any tie-up involving strategic defence interests or technology.
A 2018 French government study said consolidating the industrial base in cyber defence would be ""advisable"" to provide high security while ensuring companies were economically viable. ($1 = 0.8719 euros)

Investing.com – Clorox stock (NYSE:CLX) plummeted 14% Friday after the company revised its outlook to project a steeper decline in annual profits and margins than it earlier anticipated.
Commodity, manufacturing and logistics are to blame, with extra costs from transportation and commodity costs now seen at $500 million for the year, the company said on its conference call. The erosion in earnings will come even as the company expects revenue to decline by 1-4% for the year vs. a previous forecast of a 2-6% drop. 
Clorox’s product portfolio ranges from cleaning agents to salad-dressings to health and wellness products. The inflation in sourcing the raw materials for those goods, supply-chain related transportation pressures, and the surge in demand over the last two years It has thus been under pressure for last two years as demand for its products soared in the pandemic while supply lines were stretched. Delivery of both raw materials and then its own products took time.
To counter the surge in costs, the company will cut costs and raise prices on 85% of its portfolio by the time its financial year ends in June, CFO Kevin Jacobson said on the conference call. This is versus an earlier plan to raise prices on 70% of Clorox's products. The price hikes will have a bigger impact in the company's fiscal 2023.
Clorox now expects gross margin to decline by about 750 basis points to 36.1% compared to its previous forecast of a 300-400-basis point erosion. 
Adjusted profit per share is seen coming in between $4.25 and $4.5, compared to the previous forecast of $5.4-$5.7.

Investing.com — Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) announced its production report from January on Friday, showing a 252% year-over-year rise in bitcoin mined.
The company produced 458 BTC during the month, resulting in 5,347 BTC held in total by January 31. The figure for January is a 7.8% increase on the 425 BTC produced in December.
Riot shares popped 6% in early trading Friday. Meanwhile, bitcoin is up over 4.8% on the day.
Riot currently has a deployed fleet of around 32,552 miners, with a hash rate capacity of 3.4 exahash per second (EH/s) — the hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine bitcoin. However, the company has further miners ready for deployment and more being shipped from bitcoin server company Bitmain. Once all miners have been deployed, Riot expects to have 46,244 miners with a hash rate capacity of approximately 4.7 EH/s.
By Q4 2022, Riot anticipates a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.8 exahash per second.
Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Riot will halt its Texas bitcoin mining operations to save electricity as cold and icy temperatures impact the state. In today's production report, the company confirmed that it has closely monitored the current weather conditions in Texas and the potential impact on the supply and demand of energy in the ERCOT grid, resulting in it deciding to curtail its mining operations at the Whinstone Facility."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp is considering splitting in half instead of three and offloading its air conditioning business, the Japanese industrial conglomerate said on Friday, in an attempt to overcome shareholder opposition to its turnaround plan.
The changes would mark the latest twist in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s drawn out battle with foreign shareholders, many of them activists and hedge funds, and highlights the once-mighty conglomerate's fight to revive itself after a dramatic fall from grace.
The Nikkei reported earlier that Toshiba will sell its 60% stake in Toshiba Carrier to U.S. counterpart Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) Corp for around 100 billion yen ($870 million), adding that the two companies have reached an agreement. 
Since announcing the three-way split in November, Toshiba has examined the details of the strategic reorganisation and continued its portfolio review, the company said in a statement.
The reported changes ""remain strategic options for Toshiba,"" it said, adding that it would explain the details in investor briefings on Monday and Tuesday.
Under the new plan, Toshiba would break off its device business, including the power chip unit, the Nikkei said. Previously it had planned to split into three companies: one for energy and infrastructure, one for devices and one for flash memory chips.
By splitting into two, Toshiba will save more money that it can return to shareholders, the newspaper said.
NO NEED FOR TWO-THIRDS APPROVAL
A two-way split could be carried out with board approval under legislation recently revised to expedite breakups when the book value of assets to be spun off is worth less than a fifth of a company's total assets.
The three-way split would have required support of two-thirds of shareholders, as the assets of the new energy and infrastructure company would account for more than a fifth of the total.
Since Toshiba is nearly 30% owned by foreign funds, many of which appear to oppose the split, the 67% bar could have forced the conglomerate to ditch its plan.
A top 15 shareholder said he believed management had changed the plan to a two-way split to ""suit themselves"".

""It's no wonder shareholders talk about a lack of trust or a culture of management evading accountability,"" said the shareholder, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned positive after a negative opening on Friday, adjusting to data that suggested the labor market has been significantly stronger than thought over the last three months. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5 points, less than 0.1%, at 35,116. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite - helped by better-than-expected results from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) late on Thursday - was up 0.6%.
The Labor Department said earlier that the economy added 467,000 nonfarm jobs in January, way more than analysts had expected even before ADP's assessment that private-sector jobs fell by 300,000 last month. Even more strikingly, the government revised up payroll data for November and December by a combined total of over 700,000. 
The market's first reaction was negative, in assuming that the numbers will encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by half a percent at its meeting in March, rather than the 25 basis points it has so far guided for.  However, the figures also validated the underlying strength of the economy, which now appears much closer to having recouped the jobs it lost due to the pandemic in 2020.
""Strong hiring and strong wages -  and this is when Omicron is meant to be holding back the US economy! Just imagine what could happen in March/April."" said ING chief international economist James Knightley via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
There had been surprising evidence of consumer strength in Thursday's late earnings, which saw Snapchat owner Snap post its first ever quarterly profit and Pinterest record a better-than-expected rise in revenue. Snap stock, which had been heavily shorted in advance of the release, rose 45%, although that still only brings the stock back to where it was three weeks ago. Pinterest stock rose 5.3%.
Likewise, Amazon stock rose 9.8% in response to its numbers, which showed profit nearly doubled in the last quarter of 2021 thanks to paper gains on its holding in electric van maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). However, like Snap. Amazon too is only at a three-week high, and remains firmly in a down trend stretching back to November, in which time it has lost nearly 20%.
Tech stock have come under increasingly heavy mean-reversion pressure in recent weeks as markets have factored in rising interest rates, which raise the opportunity cost holding stocks whose ultimate value is skewed far into the future. Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) continued to lose ground on Friday, having fallen over 25% on Thursday in response to its first-ever decline in active users in the last quarter. Meta Platforms stock fell 1.4%.
However, there were other signs of mean reversion in lower-tech names too. Clorox (NYSE:CLX) stock fell 14% to its lowest level since 2018 after reporting a quarter hobbled by rising costs and waning demand for its cleaning products as fear of the Covid-19 virus ebbs. 
Elsewhere, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock also fell 10.7%, after supply chain pressures and a forecast of higher input costs spoiled its fourth-quarter report late on Thursday."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) is expected to post strong results for its beef business in a quarterly earnings report on Monday, as the Biden administration's criticism of high meat prices and fat profits for processors continues to mount.
Increased operating margins could attract more unwanted scrutiny from Washington for Tyson and three other industry behemoths that slaughter about 85% of grain-fattened cattle carved into steaks for consumers, analysts said.
The Biden administration, concerned about rising prices, said it plans to spend $1 billion and issue new rules to address a lack of ""meaningful competition"" in meat processing.
Arun Sundaram, senior equity research analyst for CFRA Research, estimates margins for Tyson's beef unit reached 16% in October to December 2021 - the first quarter of Tyson's financial year - due to higher meat prices. Margins were 13.2% a year earlier, when the unit reported quarterly sales of nearly $4 billion.
Analysts expect Tyson's quarterly revenue from all its units including beef to come in at $12.177 billion, up 16% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The company is caught between its responsibility to boost profits for shareholders and the risk of increased government scrutiny, Sundaram said.
""I think they're in a tough spot,"" he said.
Tyson said meat prices increased due to market factors including the pandemic and severe weather and that the company raised prices to combat inflation. 
In the quarter that ended on Oct. 2, Tyson said average beef prices soared 32.7% and the unit's operating margins were 22.9%. 
Ben Bienvenu, Stephens Inc managing director of food and agribusiness, estimated Tyson's beef margins were 15% in the latest quarter amid robust demand.

""There's been a willingness of consumers to absorb higher prices,"" Bienvenu said.
Meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) (JBSS3.SA) this week agreed to pay $52.5 million to settle litigation accusing U.S. beef processors of conspiring to limit supply to inflate prices and boost profits. The settlement renewed calls among U.S. senators for legislation to improve transparency in the beef market.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Royal Caribbean  stock (NYSE:RCL) was 4.2% lower in early trading Friday after the company said it will take more time to return to profits, blaming Omicron for the delay.
The cruise industry has had many false starts in the last one year, thanks to repeated outbreaks of Covid-19. While it was just reaching capacity, Omicron hit. That surge once again forced operators to change their itineraries and even cancel voyages.
The cruise operator’s fourth-quarter total revenue topped $982 million, up nearly 29 times from a year ago when the pandemic kept most luxury travel business shut. However, it was lower than estimates.
Adjusted net loss was wider than estimates at $4.78 per share.
By the end of 2021, the group returned 50 of 61 ships to operations, over 85% of its capacity. It got 12 ships back into service in the quarter through December.
“While the timing of Omicron was particularly unfortunate for the first half of 2022 bookings and will likely delay our return to profitability by a few months, we do not expect it to impact our overall recovery trajectory and the strong demand for cruising,"" President and CEO Jason Liberty said in a company statement.
Bookings in the fourth quarter were sequentially higher than the third quarter, the company said. After a fall in December, they have risen every week since the beginning of 2022 and are now back to pre-Omicron levels, it said.
The group expects to return the full fleet before the summer season with a forecast that load factors will approach historical levels in the third quarter.
It has earmarked $3.1 billion as capital expenditure for the year.

The so-called 30-year real yield, as measured by Treasury inflation-protected securities, jumped more than 4 basis points to 0.024%, a level unseen since May. The last time the benchmark was above zero was in June. Nominal Treasuries slid to their lows of the day following the employment data, with the front-end and belly of the curve leading declines.
Swaps markets showed around 32 basis points of tightening priced in for the Fed’s March meeting, slightly more than before, suggesting the market sees at least a quarter point of tightening as a done deal and around a one-in-four chance of a super-sized half-point rate increase. Around 130 basis points of increases are priced for the whole of 2022.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 467,000 in January after an upwardly revised 510,000 gain in December, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, and average hourly earnings jumped. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 125,000 advance in payrolls, though forecasts ranged widely. 
Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month the central bank is likely to begin a cycle of interest-rate hikes in March and opened the door to more frequent and potentially larger hikes than anticipated. The jump has already unsettled risk assets, which are grappling with the end of accommodative monetary policy after rallying over the pandemic. The Nasdaq Composite Index -- which includes growth stocks particularly sensitive to rising rates -- fell into a correction last month.
The selloff in Treasuries pushed rates on two- and five-year notes to their highest level this year, helping to flatten the yield curve. The three-year rate climbed almost 10 basis points to 1.52%, while the 10-year benchmark reached around 1.90%.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Automakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Hyundai Motor, predict a near two-year chip constraint will ease in the second half of 2022, but automotive chipmakers, on the other hand, expect a recovery to take longer.
During their quarterly results reporting over the past two weeks, GM CEO Mary Barra projected the semiconductor shortage would diminish in the second half, Ford forecast a significant improvement in the second half after a first-quarter low in vehicle sales, and Hyundai predicted chip supply would return to normal levels in the third quarter of this year.
But leading automotive chipmakers like NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) forecast a supply squeeze to persist despite production increases.
The differing outlooks on the most pressing issue facing the automobile industry prolong uncertainty about its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and risk hampering its efforts to transition to new, chip-intensive technologies such as electrification and safety and driving-assistant features. 
The chip shortage will cost the global auto industry in 2021 $210 billion in revenues and lost production of 7.7 million vehicles, consultant AlixPartners estimated in September.
But the tide is definitely turning, according to the automakers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which managed chip supplies last year through strategies including writing new software to handle changes in chips, expects chip shortages to last through this year before easing next year.
Chief Executive Elon Musk told an earnings call last month the shortage was not a long-term issue, with factories increasing capacity and automakers guilty of panic buying of chips which slowed the supply chain.
He described that to investors in blunt terms.
""I think there's some degree of the toilet paper problem as well, where, you know, there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID, and like, obviously, it wasn't really certainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass wiping. It's just people panicked...""
Chip firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was optimistic.
""I do think that a lot of our peers along with us are prioritizing the auto business and shipping as much as you can,"" Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm chief financial officer, told Reuters.
MATURE CHIPS
Leading automotive chipmakers, however, were less sanguine.
Infineon said on Thursday the supply-demand balance would improve in some chips for the second half of this year, but the market for mature chips - crucial to automakers - would remain tight. 
""Supply limitations are far from over and will persist well into 2022,"" Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss said during an investor call. Infineon is concerned that the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant would lead China, with its zero-COVID strategy, to shut down factories, limiting supply.
NXP also said the industry would not get out of the supply-demand imbalance this year.
Semiconductor makers have an incentive to focus on the newest, most expensive chips, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Tim Cook said there were significant supply constraints on ""legacy nodes,"" less sophisticated chips used in power management and display devices, although they are improving in the current quarter.
""There are a couple of the fabs that are going to come online towards the end of the year that will help those markets but not fully solve the problems,"" said Peter Hanbury, a partner at Bain & Company. 
A chip factory takes a couple of years to build and another couple to get to maximum capacity, STMicroelectronics said. The company said in November that it would take until 2024 or 2025 to see a major increase in capacity.
Ford has partnered with U.S. chipmaker GlobalFoundries to reduce dependence on Taiwan's TSMC on older technology chips, which Ford Chief Executive James Farley described as ""feature rich"". 
""We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes. Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes, including us,"" Farley said during a conference call. 
He said Ford would put cash up to work with GlobalFoundries on older node chips though it will take time for the chipmaker to build the chips in the United States. 

""We have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have,"" he said, adding that supply chain is critical to the transition to vehicle electrification and digitalization.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 08:55AM ET</span>",Intesa sets $25 billion payout goal and grasps digital challenge,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) dashed market hopes it could match rival UniCredit and return all additional profits to investors in coming years, saying it had to first to tackle challenges for its business.
Under a new plan to 2025 unveiled on Friday, Europe's eighth-largest bank by assets said it would spend to whittle down its soured loans and keep them close to zero.
It also plans to invest 4.8 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in IT to create a digital bank to serve four million younger customers at risk of being wooed by fintech firms. 
""This is a plan that sets up the bank for the next decade,"" said Chief Executive Carlo Messina, at the helm since 2013.
He said he was ""a lover of dividends"" and would assess on a yearly basis whether there was room to lift payouts above the targeted 70% of earnings, which was already ""a best in class.""
Intesa expects to return more than 22 billion euros ($25 billion) to investors under the plan by 2025, including a 3.4 billion euro share buyback for 2022 announced on Friday.
That brings the total payout to 6.6 billion euros this year - roughly 1.6 times last year's net income of 4.2 billion. 
""We're ready to take the same approach every year and evaluate ... without taking a commitment. The most important part of the plan is industrial not financial,"" Messina said.
Shares in Intesa were down 1.8% by early afternoon, against the Italian sector's 1.3% drop, a reaction which analysts put down to the stock's already expensive valuation.
""We expect focus on assessing how much upside risk there is to the 70% payout base case assumption,"" UBS said, contrasting the plan's scenario of no interest rate hikes with the European Central Bank's hawkish shift on Thursday.
PROFIT BOOST
Intesa aims to drive its net profit above 5 billion euros this year to reach 6.5 billion euros in 2025, thanks to 4% annual growth in net fees which it wants to account for 57% of revenues in 2025, versus 54% last year.
To achieve that, Intesa plans to add around 100 billion euros in assets under management in the period and reach a return on equity of 11.6% from 7.6% in 2021. 
Messina ruled out any major M&A as a route to growth, saying wealth management targets were too expensive, while he saw no value in buying a rival bank with its network of branches.
Intesa plans to close 1,050 of its own branches over the period, adding to 450 closures in the fourth quarter when it reached an accord with unions to cut a net 900 jobs by 2025.
The measures will help to further lower costs to 46.4% of income in 2025. 
To serve clients under 40, whose basic financial needs cost the bank more than they yield in revenues, Intesa will set up a digital bank dubbed ISY Bank.
With 13.5 million customers, or more than a fifth of Italy's population, Intesa is the country's largest retail bank as well as the biggest asset manager and life insurer.

Intesa, whose second-biggest shareholder is decarbonisation backer BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said it would cut net emissions to zero by 2050 on its entire loan book as well as the investment portfolio of its asset management and insurance.
It targets 88 billion euros in new green loans by 2025. ($1 = 0.8713 euros)

Scherr will assume his new role as CEO and a board member on Feb. 28, Hertz said in a statement, adding that Fields would remain as a director.
The leadership change comes at a time when rental car companies are dealing with a pandemic-driven surge in demand but are also grappling to secure vehicles due to global chip shortages and supply chain snarls.
Hertz is also in the process of raising debt to refinance expensive preferred stock issued as part of the company's exit from bankruptcy.
The Florida-based company, which made a stock market return last year, was in the news in November after it placed an order for 100,000 electric rental cars from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc

Scherr, who resigned from Goldman in September after a near three-decade stint, played a key role in revamping Goldman's image from a Wall Street firm to a traditional bank. 
He will receive a base salary of $1.5 mln and will have a performance-based annual bonus target of 160% of his salary, Hertz said separately in a securities filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/000110465922011716/0001104659-22-011716-index.htm.

Social media and online platforms face a raft of legislative proposals on both sides of the Atlantic that will require them to do more to counter online hate speech and disinformation.
In the EU, the Digital Services Act would force tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms, with fines of up to 6% of global turnover for non-compliance.
""It is high time that we adopt an EU legislation so that platforms don't have the last word,"" said Eric Dupond-Moretti, who was hosting the meeting in the northern France city of Lille. ""We need a clear, precise framework that respects freedom of speech.""
Google's chief legal counsel Kent Walker, who took part in the meeting, told Reuters in an emailed comment that the company welcomed the EU's plans to facilitate the sharing of digital evidence.
""We believe that the e-Evidence regulation sets a positive international precedent for supporting the needs of law enforcement while ensuring privacy and due process for users,""
said Walker, who is President, Global Affairs and Chief Legal Office at Google.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), however, did not send a representative, which Dupond-Moretti criticised ahead of the meeting.
""There will still be a chair, it will be empty, and there will be in front of this chair the Twitter tag, to show they are not there and to regret it,"" he said.

Twitter said the company was staying away because of its own COVID rules, but that it was fully committed to cooperating with authorities to make the internet safer.
Twitter last month lost a hate speech court battle in France, with judges saying it must disclose details on what it does to tackle online hatred in the country.

Investing.com – Pinterest stock (NYSE:PINS) soared 13% in premarket trading Friday after the company easily beat fourth-quarter estimates, setting aside short-term concerns around its business due to changes in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy rules.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 20% to $847 million, driven by strong advertising revenue. Pinterest said its investments in tech and augmented reality and its efforts to encourage broader user engagement yielded results: ads stayed relevant for longer and that kept the likes of Ikea on its platform.
Fourth-quarter adjusted profit per share was 49 cents, up 14%, and beat estimates.
Pinterest said the strength was driven by retail advertisers. That commentary helped ease concerns that changes to Apple’s privacy rules that have made it tougher to track users are hurting social media companies. Those fears were accentuated two days back when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) blamed them for a disappointing quarter, setting off speculation the tweaks would engulf others as well.
The growth in advertising offset a 6% year-on-year fall in monthly active users to 431 million. The company blamed “pandemic unwind”, changes in Google’s algorithm and heightened competition from video-centric consumer apps for the decline.
Despite the strength of the fourth quarter, Pinterest said it may still be affected by Apple’s changes in the future.
“The changes in the privacy and regulatory environment are generally unhelpful in our ability to deliver performance advertising results,” Bloomberg quoted Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld as saying. “We’re not immune to these issues impacting our business over time.”
To counter that, the company is investing more in technology and focusing on scaling up video features like Pinterest TV and Idea Pins. It’s also boosting influencer marketing, a space dominated by YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.

Sales of Dupixent, which is used to treat eczema, jumped 51% to $1.77 billion, while that of eye drops Eylea increased 13% to $2.45 billion.
The company also recorded $2.30 billion in sales of its COVID-19 antibody therapy, REGEN-COV, as it completed final deliveries to the U.S. government under an agreement signed in September.
That helped its quarterly revenue more than double to $4.95 billion, and beat analysts estimates of $4.51 billion, as per Refinitiv IBES data. Excluding revenue from REGEN-COV, the sales growth was 17%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January had revised its emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 antibody treatments from Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) to limit their use, as the drugs were found to be unlikely to work against the Omicron variant.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>","Russia, China agree 30-year gas deal via new pipeline, to settle in euros","By Chen Aizhu
(Reuters) - Russia has agreed a 30-year contract to supply gas to China via a new pipeline and will settle the new gas sales in euros, bolstering an energy alliance with Beijing amid Moscow's strained ties with the West over Ukraine and other issues. 
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, agreed to supply Chinese state energy major CNPC with 10 billion cubic metres of gas a year, the Russian firm and a Beijing-based industry official said.
First flows through the pipeline, which will connect Russia's Far East region with northeast China, were due to start in two to three years, the source said in comments that were later followed by an announcement of the deal by Gazprom.
Russia already sends gas to China via its Power of Siberia pipeline, which began pumping supplies in 2019, and by shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG). It exported 16.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to China in 2021. 
GRAPHIC - Russia-China plan new gas pipeline
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/mopanywylva/RussiaChinaGasPipeline.png 
The Power of Siberia network is not connected to pipelines that send gas to Europe, which has faced surging gas prices due to tight supplies, one of several points of tension with Moscow.
Under plans previously drawn up, Russia aimed to supply China with 38 bcm of gas by pipeline by 2025.
The new deal, which coincided with a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Beijing Winter Olympics, would add a further 10 bcm, increasing Russian pipeline sales under long-term contracts to China.
Gazprom gave few details about the deal in its announcement.
Russian gas from its Far East island of Sakhalin will be transported via pipeline across the Japan Sea to northeast China's Heilongjiang province, reaching up to 10 bcm a year around 2026, said the Beijing source, who asked not to be identified.
The deal would be settled in euros, the source added, in line with efforts by the two states to diversify away from U.S. dollars. 
Discussions between the two firms began several years ago after the start-up of Power of Siberia, a 4,000-km (2,500-mile)pipeline sending gas to China. Talks accelerated more recently after Beijing set its 2060 carbon neutral goal, the source said.
""China's coal shortage last year served as another wake-up call that natural gas has its special value, that's why CNPC decided to top up with the new pipeline deal,"" the source said.
A CNPC representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pricing of the new gas deal will be similar to that of Power of Siberia, the source said, adding that both were ""fairly satisfied"" with that arrangement.
The deal is expected to weigh on China's LNG import outlook. 

""Piped gas from Russia can be supplied to northern China at prices that are competitive when compared with LNG,"" said Ken Kiat Lee, analyst at consultancy FGE.
The IEA said in a report last week that China will remain the single largest country contributor to LNG import growth, but with a growth rate dropping to 9% in 2022 from 17% in 2021 due to the ramp-up of pipeline flows from Russia and the overall slowdown in gas demand growth.

Putin told Xi that Russia had prepared a new deal to supply China with an additional 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas, according to a broadcast of their talks aired in Moscow.
Russia, one of the global leaders in hydrocarbon supplies, has been strengthening its ties with China, the world's top energy consumer against the backdrop of Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine and other issues.
The broadcast aired in Moscow showed Xi and Putin, neither one wearing a mask, sitting opposite each across a large table in a Beijing state guesthouse, surrounded by masked aides.
""I would like to thank you for the invitation to the opening of the Olympic Games,"" Putin told Xi. ""We know firsthand that this is a huge job. I am sure that our Chinese friends have done it brilliantly, as you always do when preparing such major events.""
Xi said the meeting injected new vitality into the relationship, according to the report.
The Olympics, already transformed by the coronavirus pandemic and to be held within a strictly closed loop, have also been overshadowed by the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The United States and some of its allies have announced a diplomatic boycott of the Games in protest at China's human rights record. China denies any abuses.
Earlier, China state television footage showed a jet flying with the Russian and Chinese flags. Next to it were jets with Mongolian and Serbian flags. Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister L. Oyun-Erdene, of Mongolia, are expected to attend the opening ceremony later on Friday.
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and the United Arab Emirates' Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had also touched down, according to state media reports.
Russia and China coordinated their positions on Ukraine during a meeting between their foreign ministers, Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov, in Beijing on Thursday, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
In response, the United States warned Chinese firms that they would face consequences if they sought to evade export controls imposed on Russia in the event of it invading Ukraine.
""We have an array of tools that we can deploy if we see foreign companies, including those in China, doing their best to backfill U.S. export control actions, to evade them, to get around them,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing.

Before Lavrov, Beijing had not received foreign political guests for almost two years as it tried to keep the coronavirus out.
Thousands of Russian troops have massed near the border of Ukraine, raising fears of an invasion, which Russia denies planning. Russia has asked NATO to bar Ukraine from joining and to pull out of eastern Europe.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in mixed fashion Friday, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq index outpeforming after strong earnings from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), ahead of the monthly jobs report.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 180 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.4%.
The importance of the so-called FAANG stocks on market sentiment has been amply illustrated this week - Alphabet’s strong fourth quarter pushed markets higher on Wednesday, before Meta Platforms’ limp guidance prompted sharp selling on Thursday. It’s Amazon’s turn today.
Amazon’s stock traded more than 11% higher in premarket trading after the multinational technology company released better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after the close Thursday, underpinned by strong Cloud growth and a hefty one-off gain from its stake in electric van manufacturer Rivian  (NASDAQ:RIVN). 
Amazon also reported ad revenue of $9.7 billion for the fourth quarter, up 32% from last year, and $31 billion for the year - more than Google’s YouTube.
Amazon wasn’t the only tech stock to offer up well-received earnings late Thursday, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock gained over 14% premarket and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock soared almost 50%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed more than 500 points, or 1.5%, lower on Thursday, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 2.4% and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3.7%, its weakest daily performance since September 2020.
Other earnings are due from the likes of drugmakers Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), while  Royal Caribbean  's (NYSE:RCL) numbers should make for an interesting read-through to the travel sector and its projected recovery.
Ford (NYSE:F) will also be in focus after the auto giant blamed supply shortages of key inputs for holding back its fourth-quarter earnings, while bleach manufacturer Clorox (NYSE:CLX) pointed to rising costs for its disappointing outlook.
Away from the corporate sector, the focus will be on the official jobs report, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with analysts starting the week expecting 150,000 new jobs to have been created in January.
However, Wednesday’s weak ADP report, with just over 300,000 jobs lost in January and initial jobless claims below expectations on Thursday mean a poor Omicron-influenced number is being factored in.
Oil prices climbed Friday as winter weather swept across large areas of the U.S., threatening to disrupt crude supplies in the largest energy consumer in the world.
Crude is heading for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, with the market also supported by the ongoing standoff on Ukraine, and the conflict in Yemen.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $92.19 a barrel, passing $90 for the first time since 2014, while the Brent contract rose 2% to $92.97.   
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,811.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1475.

Net profit was $23 million, a first since its public debut in March 2018, as revenue rose 42% to $1.3 billion.
Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:FB) disclosure of a first-ever quarterly loss of subscribers in its history has weighed on stocks of social media platforms like Snap and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). The Facebook-owner blamed changes to Apple’s privacy rules that have made it tougher for apps to track users and sell targeted ads for its below-par performance.
Many wondered if those changes would have an industry-wide impact. For Snap, this wasn’t the case as it grew its subscriber base and got more money from each subscriber, on average. Snap closed the year with 319 million average daily active users, adding 13 million during the quarter. Average revenue per user rose 18% in the same period. The company also booked positive free cash flow in the quarter. 
The company is now projecting current-quarter revenue to be around $1.06 billion with a likely breakeven at operating level on an adjusted basis, which would make it the third such result in a row.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Assa Abloy, the world's biggest lockmaker, reported better than expected fourth-quarter profit growth on Friday, as price hikes and stronger demand helped mitigate continued pandemic-related supply chain challenges. 
CEO Nico Delvaux said the Swedish group had raised prices again in January and would lift them further in February. If raw material costs don't climb again, the price hikes should more than compensate for recent cost increases in the second half of 2022, he told analysts and reporters in a call. 
Operating profit in the fourth quarter grew to 4.01 billion crowns ($441.95 million) from 3.48 billion a year earlier before restructuring costs. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 3.87 billion crown profit. 
Shares in the company were up 5% at 1109 GMT.
The group said price increases, cost control and sales growth bolstered profits, helping offset record high raw material costs, logistic challenges and component shortages accompanying the global economy's rapid recovery from coronavirus restrictions.
Assa Abloy (OTC:ASAZY), whose products range from security doors and automated entrance solutions to electronic and mechanical locks under brands such as Yale, said sales excluding acquisitions were up 10%, with particularly strong growth in its Americas division. 
""As many restrictions were phased out, the activity level improved,"" Delvaux said in the earnings statement.

The top three clouds, Amazon Web Services (AWS),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure and Google Cloud, also each grew market share by a percentage point during the last three months of 2021 compared with the prior quarter at the expense of smaller vendors, research company Canalys said on Thursday. 
Canalys pegged their shares at 33% for AWS, 22% for Azure and 9% for Google.
""Multicloud doesn't mean spreading your wealth across multiple clouds,"" said Sid Nag, a vice president at tech advisory firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). ""There's still a primary cloud you're doing most of your business with.""
Capital One, which has said it was the first major U.S. bank to fully ditch data centers for the cloud and struck an early deal with AWS, is a case in point.
While it has adopted Google and Azure for some needs, it has expanded with AWS to become one of its larger users, according to two people familiar with the matter. They declined to be identified due to confidentiality agreements.
AWS said that a multicloud approach ultimately generates headaches for customers. ""AWS has proven its reliability,"" it said in a statement.
MULTICLOUD LIMITATIONS
Clouds have become big drivers of growth at the big tech companies. AWS accounted for 13% of Amazon's revenue last year and 74% of its operating income. Cloud made up 7.5% of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s revenue. The Intelligent Cloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of Microsoft’s overall sales.
Amazon attributed its cloud growth last year to expanding its sales team, adding data centers in new regions and clients moving faster to the cloud in the face of the pandemic. 
Its cloud results were one of several factors sending Amazon's stock as much as 17% higher in extended trade on Thursday. Other cloud companies gained as Amazon's results highlighted the industry's prospects. Hashicorp Inc and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) Inc, firms which aim to make multicloud systems easier to manage, gained 5% and 4% respectively.
The complexities of a multicloud approach may also be currently working in Amazon's favor.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co last September announced it would move into the multicloud with Azure and Google.
""Concentration risk is something that is talked about internally, talked about in the regulatory community as a concern,"" Christopher Marsh-Bourdon, its head of hybrid environments, told Reuters. ""Putting all your eggs in one basket isn’t always the best approach.""
But he added that the bank is taking time to develop its expertise and will need at least five years before maintaining a significant presence in the cloud. 
And some companies that are smaller or newer to the cloud prefer one vendor, said Sigal Zarmi, a board member at Hashicorp.
Some multicloud deals have also been relatively small.

 Verint Systems  (NASDAQ:VRNT) Inc agreed to use Google Cloud as part of a deal to bring on Google as a client, according to a video last year on Verint's website. But Google Cloud is only one of several providers the business software company uses.
""Certain regions and industry sectors have preferences for specific cloud options,"" Verint Chief Product Officer Jaime Meritt told Reuters. ""And we find that a multicloud strategy is the best path for Verint and our customers.""

Investing.com – Ford Motor stock (NYSE:F) fell 5% in Friday’s premarket trading after supply shortages of key inputs pushed the company’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue well below estimates.
The carmaker booked adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share on revenue of nearly $38 billion. Analysts expected those numbers to be 44 cents and $41 billion, respectively. Wholesale sales were down 11%, a fall the company aims to reverse with a 10%-15% increase in 2022. However, the recovery will be back-loaded: Ford warned unit sales will fall in the current quarter.
“We have incredible demand for our products,” Bloomberg quoted Chief Financial Officer John Lawler as saying. “It’s the supply chains that limited what we could produce and what we could provide. And we see that easing into ’22, and you’ll see that flowing through our profits.”
The company is projecting commodity costs to be higher by $1.5 billion-$2 billion this year.
Investors have cheered Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley’s effort to accelerate Ford’s switch to electric vehicles, evident in the demand for its electric truck F-150 Lightning. The stock was the fifth best performing on S&P 500 last year.
According to Reuters, Ford has 275,000 orders for its electric F-150 Lightning, transit vans and Mustang Mach-E utility vehicles, and expects to double electric vehicle production capacity to 600,000 vehicles a year by 2023.
Ford has earmarked $7 billion-$8 billion for capital spending in 2022, up from $6.2 billion in 2021.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has taken a tough line with major tech groups in recent years, investigating their dominance of markets such as digital advertising and seeking to block the Facebook-Giphy deal.
The CMA ordered Meta to sell animated images platform Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million in May 2020, after it decided the remedies offered by the U.S. company did not answer its concerns over the impact to digital advertising. 
It said on Friday that Meta had failed to comply with certain aspects of its requirements in regard to the handling of Giphy, with the U.S. firm failing to notify the UK regulator that key staff had left Meta.
The CMA described this as a ""serious and particularly flagrant nature of Meta's failure to comply"" with rules it set to make sure the two firms were still competing with each other, and do not integrate, while the regulator investigated the deal. 
Friday's announcement marks a new deterioration in relations between the U.S. tech giant and the UK regulator.
The CMA fined Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) 50.5 million pounds over other breaches in October last year, and ordered Meta to sell Giphy. Meta is appealing the ruling to sell. It said on Friday it did not agree with the CMA's latest fine but would pay it. 

It added that it could not prevent staff from leaving the company. 
""We intend to pay the fine, but it is problematic that the CMA can take decisions that could directly impact the rights of our U.S. employees protected under U.S. law,"" a spokesperson said.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 05:16AM ET</span>",Southwest Airlines to bring alcohol back on planes after nearly two years,"(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co will resume alcohol sales on its flights this month after nearly two years, the Texas-based carrier said on Thursday, a pause it extended last year due to a surge in in-flight disruptions by passengers.
U.S. airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic had mostly suspended in-flight services on domestic flights to avoid having passengers remove their masks while eating or drinking.
Southwest, which had paused alcohol services in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, said that it would resume the sale of the beverages on Feb. 16. 
The beverages would include wine, vodka, tequila, rum, on most of its flights of 176 miles (283.24 km) or more. The airline also said it will add a new line-up of non-alcoholic beverages like tonic water, apple juice, Coke Zero, Dr. Pepper, hot tea, and hot cocoa.
""Customers have expressed a desire for more beverage options,"" Tony Roach, vice president customer experience and customer relations, said in a statement. 
The union, which represents Southwest Airlines' flight attendants, said the move is ""both unsafe and irresponsible.""
""TWU Local 556 is outraged at Southwest Airlines' resumption of alcohol sales,"" Lyn Montgomery, president of TWU Local 556 said in a statement when contacted by Reuters. 
""We have adamantly and unequivocally informed management that resuming sales of alcohol while the mask mandate is in place has the great potential to increase customer non-compliance and misconduct issues.""
Southwest did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the union's statement.

Southwest's decision to extend the pause on alcohol services last year came following an incident where a passenger assaulted a flight attendant verbally and physically, during a flight from Sacramento to San Diego.
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of disruptive and sometimes violent incidents in 2021, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has pledged a ""zero-tolerance"" approach towards unruly air passengers.

(Reuters) -Britain's SSP, owner of Upper Crust and other catering brands, said on Friday that sales were recovering as people were commuting by train to work again after coronavirus curbs hit travel and slowed growth at its airport and rail station outlets.
SSP, which also runs Burger King and Jamie Oliver chains in travel locations, said its sales in the latest eight weeks to Jan. 30 were at around 57% of 2019 levels, just before the pandemic hit Europe. However, they were down from the nine weeks before that when sales ran at 66% above 2019 levels.
The recent uptick in sales, following the lifting of restrictions in the UK and some European markets, was driven mainly by a rise in the number of rail passengers. 
Shares in the London-listed firm, which operates in 36 countries, were up nearly 3% by 0925 GMT after it also said it made an underlying core profit in the first quarter to December, while net cashflow was broadly neutral.
Analysts said SSP was well placed to expand and take market share, while restoring margins, as leisure travel could recover fully even as business travel remains uncertain.
""The range of potential recovery outcomes seems very wide at this stage, which SSP now has the balance sheet to contend with,"" Stifel analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue said in a note.
SSP raised 450 million pounds ($610.65 million) in a rights issue last April to see itself through the crisis. This month, it fully repaid 300 million pound in COVID-19 government financing, leaving it with 630 million pounds of available liquidity.
The turnaround at SSP follows a lengthy period of making losses in the wake of the pandemic. The company returned to profit in the fourth quarter ending September 2021.
SSP still expects its revenue and profit margins to broadly return to 2019 levels by 2024.

890,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 05:08AM ET</span>","Amazon Surges on Raising U.S. Prime Fee, Strength in Cloud Unit","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared 12% in premarket trading Friday after the company raised the price of its U.S. Prime membership to offset spiraling labor and transportation costs.
A Prime member in the country will now pay $139 a year compared to $119 earlier. The increase will help restore profitability to an operation that had lost money at the operating level in the fourth quarter. However, it also risks losing members as disposable income comes under pressure from high inflation.
The fourth quarter was a mixed bag, with a weak underlying performance in e-commerce flattered by paper gains on its stake in electric van maker Rivian. Fourth-quarter net income almost doubled to go past $14 billion, mostly due to a one-off gain of $11.8 billion on its Rivian stake. But shares of the EV-maker have lost more than 40% since the end of the year.
Once again, the company was entirely dependent on its Cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, for all of its operating profit, clocking nearly $18 billion in sales, a 40% jump. Rival Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud business topped $18 billion in sales in its most recent quarter.
Amazon also broke out its revenue from advertising for the first time, and at $31 billion, it emerged as bigger than YouTube’s $29 billion. Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was $9.7 billion, up 32% year-on-year.
However, there were worries. Total operating expenses climbed 13% to nearly $134 billion as the company struggled with labor shortage and supply chain issues to book holiday sales. While net sales rose 9% to top $137 billion in the fourth quarter, operating income nearly halved to $3.5 billion. International business booked a large operating loss. North Americam e-commerce was in the red too.
The company is now forecasting net sales to grow 5.5% to $114.5 billion in the current quarter at the center of its guidance range, well below its historical growth rate.

Scientists will initially screen 138 drugs with known antiviral activity against the COVID-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus to study and identify potent combinations, the university said in a statement https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2022-02-04-research-collaboration-launched-focus-repurposing-existing-anti-viral-therapies on Friday. 
The rapid spread of Omicron across the world has also forced researchers to find options that work against the variant. Britain currently has the seventh-highest tally of COVID cases globally, according to Reuters.
The most effective combinations discovered through the project will be presented to British authorities, including the Antiviral Task Force and UK-CTAP, so they can be added to clinical trials, Oxford said. 
""There are multiple benefits with discovering new treatments in this way,"" said Ultan Power, one of the principal investigators of the project.
""They have been through all the necessary checks so we know they are safe and readily available, they can be self-administered and used at home, helping to reduce the burden on the healthcare system.""

892,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 04:56AM ET</span>",Earnings whiplash points to more volatility for U.S. markets,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Diverging earnings from megacap growth stocks are fueling wild swings in equities, opening the door for more volatility on the heels of last month’s sharp drop as investors grow more discerning in the names they pick.
Many market participants hoped that earnings from the big, tech-focused stocks that have led markets for years would lend equities a modicum of support after January’s sharp declines, which saw the Nasdaq Composite fall 9% and the S&P 500 give up 5.3% after a hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve.
But this week's earnings from megacap growth stock names has whiplashed investors.
""I'm concerned that if we continue to see major moves in widely owned stocks, investors will get turned off by markets,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader, and market structure consultant with Bright Trading LLC. “One thing is certain, volatility is here to stay.”
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, rose on Thursday to its highest level in a week as investors punished Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms for disappointing their expectations, with a 26.4% plunge in Meta’s shares lopping some $200 billion from its market value - the biggest ever one-day slide in market value for a U.S. public company. [L4N2UE1L9]
After the bell, sentiment seemed to take an about-face when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) delighted investors by hiking its Prime subscription rate and soared in after-hours trading on Thursday, lifting futures with it. Earlier in the week, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's shares surged after it reported record revenue. [L4N2UE30Z]
The wild moves may offer a preview of what is in store for markets in coming months, as looming interest rate hikes make investors less forgiving of bad news and dim the allure of the richly valued companies whose shares thrived over the last two years amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The market is highly volatile and very choppy and if you are going to report bad earnings you need to expect that you will get taken out behind the woodshed,” said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). “Companies that are going to buck that trend are companies that are able to produce better numbers and more upbeat guidance.""
Overall, the surprise factor - which shows the rate by which companies significantly exceeded analyst estimates - dropped to 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 16% a year ago. In the communications services sector, where Meta is represented, the factor fell to 6.1% from 24.3%, according to Refinitiv data.
PICK AND CHOOSE
The divergence in fortunes is causing investors to choose carefully.
Josh Wein, a portfolio manager for the Hennessy Technology Fund, is focusing on companies that can demonstrate pricing power – or the ability to maintain or increase margins despite rising commodity and wage costs by raising prices – in the face of rising inflation.
Wein, who does not have a position in Meta, expects to see a widening gap in performance this year between companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) that primarily focus on business customers, and those like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta that rely more on consumer preferences in an increasingly competitive landscape.
""This is a time when companies with wider moats around their businesses are going to outperform,"" he said, citing his bullishness on companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Alphabet.
Julie Biel, a portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, which owns shares of Meta Platforms, is focusing on software companies that sold off during the widespread declines the Nasdaq index experienced in December and January, yet are in niche business markets.

Among her holdings is Duck Creek Technologies Inc, which provides cloud software for property and casualty insurance companies. Shares of the company are down around 17% for the year to date.
""I really took it on the chin in January, and now I have the ability to add back into businesses that have strong pricing power,"" she said.

The appointment of a receiver will also not have any bearing on the group's restructuring process, said the person.
U.S. asset manager Oaktree Capital Management, a lender to Evergrande to develop a vast land plot in the rural Yuen Long district, has sought to seize control of the asset by appointing a receiver, a separate person said last month.
Oaktree's move came after Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer with more than $300 billion in debt, defaulted on a secured loan, said the first person, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
The person said that the asset was likely to be sold in the ""relative near term"", and that Oaktree would be repaid after the sale was completed, and any residual proceeds would be recovered by Evergrande.
The Financial Times reported on Jan. 28 that Oaktree also took control of a residential development project of Evergrande in Shanghai after the developer defaulted on a secured loan provided by the asset manager late last year.
The person said that no other international creditor of Evergrande had taken similar actions.
Evergrande said in an exchange filing on Jan. 30 that it was seeking legal advice on the appointment of a receiver for the Yuen Long plot and that the company was in discussions with the lender. 
The developer said that the land in Yuen Long is charged as security for $520 million advanced to the group in January 2021. Evergrande's filing, however, did not mention the name of the creditor.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on Friday. 
Oaktree declined to comment.
Once China's top-selling developer, Evergrande said last month it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months as it scrambled to reassure creditors hit by defaults since its finances began to unravel last year.

The developer has been struggling to repay creditors, suppliers and investors in wealth management products. Nearly $20 billion of its international bonds are now deemed to be in default.
""It's a very complex situation so the company needs time to evaluate alternatives and formulate a restructuring plan; it has set a six-month deadline within which (it needs) to achieve these objectives,"" said the person.

Investing.com - European stock markets were mixed in early trade on Friday, with rising bond yields weighing on the German market in particular following the European Central Bank’s hawkish turn on Thursday.
By 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, while the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.5%.
The European Central Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged at its policy-setting meeting on Thursday, as widely expected, but ECB President Christine Lagarde declined to repeat previous guidance that an interest rate increase this year was extremely unlikely, leaving the door open to a 2022 hike.
The ECB had been seen as among the most dovish of the world's leading central banks, but this change in stance has seen German bond yields rise Friday, with 5-Year notes trading above zero for the first time in over three years.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now predicts two interest rate hikes this year, in September and December.
This has tended to overshadow a larger than expected rise in German industrial orders in December, up 2.8% on the month, after a revised increase of 3.6% in November - numbers that suggest the German economy's contraction at the end of last year won't be extended into 2022.
Eurozone retail sales, later in the session, are expected to more vividly illustrate the impact of the Omicron surge late last year, dropping 0.5% on the month. 
However, the day’s major economic data release comes in the U.S., with the widely watched monthly official jobs report due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 150,000 in January, a slowdown from the previous month’s near 200,000 gain. The risk is for a downward surprise, after ADP reported a shock drop in private-sector employment in the month. However, the relationship between the two surveys has been badly stretched by the pandemic.
Overnight, stellar results from online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had set a positive tone, pushing U.S. equity futures sharply higher.
Back in Europe, Carlsberg (CSE:CARLb) stock rose 2.2% after the Danish brewer posted fourth-quarter sales above expectations, while Sanofi (PA:SASY) stock 0.4% after the French drugmaker posted a hefty rise in its 2021 earnings, and predicted even stronger earnings next year after losing ground in the Covid-19 vaccine race.
 Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb) stock soared 6.3% after the world's biggest lockmaker reported better than expected fourth-quarter profit growth on Friday as stronger demand helped mitigate continued pandemic-related supply chain challenges. 
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) stock pulled back from its highest in nearly four years, after Italy's biggest bank by assets announced plans to hand back to investors more than 22 billion euros in dividends and a share buyback over the period to 2025. Other bank stocks, however, were in the ascendant as the ECB's message lifted bond yields, offering more attractive lending spreads for their key business.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Societe Generale (DE:SOGN), National Bank of Greece (AT:NBGr), UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and Banco de Sabadell (MC:SABE) all hit their highest in over a year.
Oil prices climbed Friday as winter weather swept across large areas of the U.S., threatening to disrupt crude supplies in the largest energy consumer in the world.
Crude is heading for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, with the market also supported by the ongoing standoff on Ukraine, and the conflict in Yemen.
By 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $91.52 a barrel, passing $90 for the first time since 2014, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $92.25.   
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,810.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1458.

By Mathieu Rosemain and Julien Ponthus
PARIS (Reuters) - The French government holds the final keys to any move to buy the BDS cybersecurity division of France's Atos, industry sources and analysts said, after French defence company Thales was reported to be devising a break-up plan.
Atos said on Thursday that its cybersecurity arm, BDS, was not for sale after sources told Reuters that Thales was working on a plan to buy the business, having approached private equity firms about exploring a joint offer and break-up.
Atos, formed partly by a string of acquisitions made under former CEO Thierry Breton, now EU industry chief and a former French finance minister, has deep links to France's security world in which the state has the ultimate say over tie-ups.
Atos secures communications for the French military and secret services and manufactures servers to make supercomputers able to process troves of data for research or to develop the nascent artificial intelligence industry.
""The real question is about Atos future and that's really a political one,"" said Mikael Jacoby, who heads continental European sales trading at Oddo Securities.
""I think that issue will stay on investors' mind even if in the short term there's nothing to expect,"" he added, saying that interest from clients had gone down after Thales denied considering a bid for the entire Atos group.
Atos shares fell around 7% on Thursday after rising 10% on Wednesday.
One of Atos' oldest clients is France's CEA, the country's atomic energy commission, which it helped simulate nuclear missile tests. It also inherited confidential technology through the 2014 purchase of Groupe Bull, industry sources say.
It won a contract to help build a supercomputer in India, a country with which France has strengthened its partnership on defence and security. 
""This is highly strategic and a matter of sovereignty,"" said a source close to Atos, with the regards to the Indian contract. ""Just like nuclear submarines.""
DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY

French President Emmanuel Macron has made the matter of 'digital sovereignty' a top priority as France presides the European Union until June. A ministerial conference on ""building digital sovereignty in Europe"" is scheduled early next week. 
""We follow all French companies closely,"" a spokesperson for the Finance Ministry said when asked about the situation at Atos, whose shares have lost half of their price over the last year following a string of setbacks that led to the departure of Breton's successor, Elie Girard.
Thales has long coveted the cybersecurity assets of Atos, which it beat to the purchase of  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) in 2019, but whether it can find an agreed solution remains a puzzle, analysts said.
It said on Wednesday it would potentially be interested in any cybersecurity activities that were on sales, adding that no discussions were under way with Atos.
Cybersecurity is part of a cluster of sectors subject to extra government approval where foreign bidders are involved. 
""If Thales wanted to bid for the whole of Atos as a French company and dispose of assets it did not want such as IT services, that would not pose a serious problem,"" a senior French industry source said.
""Putting across an offer together with foreign funds and then breaking it up is a different discussion,"" he added.
Thales ruled out any interest in the whole of Atos on Wednesday.
One of Thales' two top investors is the French state, which is also its biggest customer. This situation makes the alternative of a hostile bid difficult to contemplate. 

""Thales is the state and it is also Dassault, which would not go against the state,"" the senior industry source said.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 03:40AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Troubles come in threes...or more,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao.
Misfortunes don't come singly, so the idiom goes, and markets are being whiplashed by a whole slew of negatives, that could see this month turn again into the nightmare that was January.
For now, stocks are attempting to claw their way higher, after a profits-beat by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lifted its shares 17% after-hours, following a 7% decline during Thursday's trading session.
Some other tech peers saw similar gyrations, with buoyant earnings boosting Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares 50% after close of trade.
Asia choses to take its cue from Wall Street's after-hours upswing, rather than the earlier 3.7% Nasdaq drop, European markets are opening higher and U.S. indexes are tipped to open with gains on Friday.
But will it last?
The earnings hits at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta (the $200 billion wiped off its value on Thursday was the biggest ever), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are worrying, coming as they do when the Federal Reserve is bent on tightening policy in coming months.
GRAPHIC: A record-setting plunge, https://graphics.reuters.com/META-ZUCKERBERG/byvrjxmowve/chart.png Thursday's shock partly emanated from Europe -- aside from a Bank of England rate rise, the hitherto dovish ECB appeared to change tack and concede a 2022 rate hike was not out of bounds after all.
The volte face came after a record-high euro zone inflation print. And as oil prices surged past $90 a barrel, expect no relief on that front.
GRAPHIC: HICP, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgjbglvb/Pasted%20image%201643926086314.png Bank analysts are now falling over each other in their rush to predict one, two or even three ECB hikes this year. So sub-zero euro zone yields are vanishing fast, with Dutch five-year yields just climbing above 0% for the first time since 2018.
It has somewhat taken markets' focus off the U.S. monthly jobs data due on Friday. But a dire private payrolls reading from the ADP earlier this week -- showing 300,000 jobs vanishing versus forecasts for 180,000 jobs added -- has stoked fears of a similarly awful set of numbers on Friday.
Yet the payrolls, just like the ongoing company earnings season, may show unrelenting cost pressures -- in December payrolls, average hourly earnings rose to 4.7% and forecasts are January will bring a rise above 5%.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:
-UK's Johnson seeks to reset beleaguered premiership
-German industrial orders Dec
-U.S. non-farm payrolls

-U.S. earnings: Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb
-European earnings: Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY),  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY),

Money markets have priced in 50 basis points of tightening for December, which would be enough to end seven years of negative ECB deposit rates.

Although earnings in 2021 were more than double those in 2020, the infrastructure group's annual net income last year was still about 20% below 2019 levels at 2.60 billion euros ($2.98 billion).
The majority owner of London's Gatwick airport said it expected passenger numbers at its airports to recover in 2022 to around 60% of their 2019 levels, bringing the unit's net income close to breakeven, unless the COVID-19 health crisis worsens again.
Chief Executive Xavier Huillard said in a statement that passenger numbers had progressively improved from summer in the northern hemisphere, and that the business had benefited from the initial impact of drastic cost-cutting measures it had previously introduced.
Global travel has remained far below its pre-pandemic levels even with widespread vaccinations, as countries imposed new entry restrictions over the northern hemisphere winter to curb the spread of the highly-transmissable Omicron variant. 
Vinci's airport traffic climbed 12% last year from 2020 lows but remained at just a third of their pre-pandemic levels.
The group posted a record free cash flow of 5.28 billion euros, well ahead of analysts' consensus at 3.34 billion, according to FactSet data.
Its revenues also surpassed 2019 levels by 3% reaching 49.40 billion euros, while core earnings surged to 4.72 billion, beating analysts' forecasts for 4.47 billion but still short pre-pandemic earnings. 
The group expects Cobra IS, a renewable energy-focused business it acquired from Spanish rival ACS last year, to generate revenues of around 5.5 billion euros in 2022.

Its construction division should remain busy and improve its operating margin, it added, while its motorways business should see this year's traffic surpass 2019.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Faced with deal fees in the Gulf region a fraction of those in markets elsewhere, many Dubai bankers are handing in their notices, attracted by the lure of cashing out, stock options and share grants at startups.
Veteran investment banker Omar Abuinnab is one of them. He left Guggenheim Partners' Middle East unit in December to set up Keyper, a Dubai real estate technology start-up.
Launched in January, Keyper describes itself as a private banker to real estate investors. Such ""proptech"" companies constitute a burgeoning global industry, which has secured $2.6 billion of global investment in 2019, up from $1 billion in 2016, according to a KPMG report in 2020.
Abuinnab is not alone. Former Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co banker Youssef Salem moved to Dubai-based transport startup Swvl, which in July announced a merger with U.S. blank-check company Queen’s Gambit. The deal valued Swvl at roughly $1.5 billion.
Amit Agarwal, who was at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), joined Mideast logistics and trucking technology firm TruKKer as group chief financial officer.
""In the past, people got into investment banking because it was among the highest-paid jobs. Now they're trying to build unicorns,"" said Abuinnab, referring to companies that are worth $1 billion or more.
Dubai's tech success stories have fuelled more interest into the sector.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s acquisition of Middle East online retailer Souq.com in 2017 for $580 million triggered more deals in the sector, including Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s $3.1 billion acquisition of ride-hailing firm Careem in 2019.
But for bankers, the payout for such deals can be slim compared with those in other regions.
Saudi Telecom Co's tech unit Arabian Internet and Communications Services Co said it would pay $12 million in fees for its initial public offering, according to its prospectus in September.
The fees, shared by banks, lawyers and auditors, equate to about 1.3% of the deal value, compared with 5% in the U.S. or Europe. 
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), whose offering raised a record $29.4 billion in 2019, paid top banks on the deal $3 million to $4 million each.
Dubai has not had a major initial public offering since 2017, when Emaar Properties spun off its unit Emaar Development and listed the company on the local bourse.
That leaves people like Keyper CEO Abuinnab, 44, seeking other outlets for their ambitions. He next plans to expand the company's operations into global cities, including London.

""Real estate investors are not well serviced in this region. I wanted to elevate that experience from my financial background to property owners to help them make better investment decisions utilising real time data and analytics,"" he said.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's Afrigen Biologics has used the publicly available sequence of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to make its own version of the shot, which could be tested in humans before the end of this year, Afrigen's top executive said on Thursday.
The vaccine candidate would be the first to be made based on a widely used vaccine without the assistance and approval of the developer. It is also the first mRNA vaccine designed, developed and produced at lab scale on the African continent. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) last year picked a consortium including Afrigen for a pilot project to give poor and middle-income countries the know-how to make COVID vaccines, after market leaders of the mRNA COVID vaccine,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech and Moderna, declined a WHO request to share their technology and expertise. 
The WHO and consortium partners hope their technology transfer hub will help overcome inequalities between rich nations and poorer countries in getting access to vaccines. Some 99% of Africa's vaccines against all diseases are imported and the negligible remainder manufactured locally.
During the pandemic, wealthy countries have hoovered up most of the world's supplies of vaccines.
Biovac, a partly state-owned South African vaccine producer, will be the first recipient of the technology from the hub. Afrigen has also agreed to help train companies in Argentina and Brazil.
In September, the WHO's hub in Cape Town decided to go it alone after failing to bring on board Pfizer and Moderna, both of which have argued they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process.
Moderna had no immediate comment on Afrigen's announcement on Thursday.
Moderna's vaccine was chosen by the WHO due to an abundance of public information and the company's pledge not to enforce patents during the pandemic. It's not clear what will happen after the pandemic ends and whether the company will try to enforce them again. 
'CUTTING-EDGE PRODUCTS'
""If this project shows that Africa can take cutting edge technology and produce cutting-edge products, this will banish this idea that Africa can't do it and change the global mindset ... this can be a game-changer,"" Charles Gore, executive director at MPP, told Reuters at Afrigen's facility, a converted warehouse.
Under pressure to make drugs in lower-income countries, Moderna and BioNTech have announced plans to build mRNA vaccine factories in Africa, but production is still a long way off. 
""We haven't copied Moderna, we've developed our own processes because Moderna didn't give us any technology,"" Petro Terblanche, managing director at Afrigen, told Reuters.
""We started with the Moderna sequence because that gives, in our view, the best starting material. But this is not Moderna’s vaccine, it is the Afrigen mRNA hub vaccine,"" Terblanche said.
She later took a delegation of EU diplomats on a tour of the state-of-the-art facility where scientists were seen making mRNA in sterile white-walled rooms.
She said it had managed to make, in collaboration with Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, its first micro-litre laboratory scale batches of COVID mRNA vaccines at the Cape Town facility.
EASIER STORAGE
Terblanche said Afrigen was also working on a next generation mRNA vaccine that didn't need freezing temperatures for storage, required for the Pfizer and Moderna doses, and which would be better suited to Africa, which is often dealing with high temperatures and poor health facilities and infrastructure.

""We will only make our clinical trial batch probably in six months from now, (meaning) ... fit for humans. And the target is November 2022,"" Terblanche added.
Online training for other companies to make the shot started with manufacturers in Brazil and Argentina last year. Afrigen expects to get more on board within the next month.

(Reuters) -Mark Zuckerberg lost $29 billion in net worth on Thursday as Meta Platforms Inc's stock marked a record one-day plunge, while fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos was set to add $20 billion to his personal valuation after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s blockbuster earnings.
Meta's stock fell 26%, erasing more than $200 billion in the biggest ever single-day market value wipeout for a U.S. company. That pulled down founder and Chief Executive Officer Zuckerberg's net worth to $85 billion, according to Forbes.
Zuckerberg owns about 12.8% of the tech behemoth formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Bezos, the founder and chairman of e-commerce retailer Amazon, owns about 9.9% of the company, according to Refinitiv data. He is also the world's third richest man, according to Forbes. 
Amazon's holiday-quarter profit surged, thanks to its investments in electric vehicle company Rivian; and the company said it would hike annual prices of Prime subscriptions in the United States, sending its shares up 15% in extended trading and readying it for its biggest percentage gain since October 2009 on Friday. 
Bezos' net worth rose 57% to $177 billion in 2021 from a year earlier, according to Forbes, largely from Amazon's boom during the pandemic when people were highly dependent on online shopping.
Zuckerberg's one-day wealth decline is among the biggest ever and comes after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc top boss Elon Musk's $35 billion single-day paper loss in November. Musk, the world's richest person, had then polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users if he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric carmaker. Tesla shares have yet to recover from the resulting selloff.
Following the $29 billion wipeout, Zuckerberg is in the twelfth spot on Forbes' list of real-time billionaires, below Indian business moguls Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. 

To be sure, trading in technology stocks remains volatile as investors struggle to price in the impact of high inflation and an expected rise in interest rates. Meta shares could very well recover sooner rather than later, with the hit to Zuckerberg's wealth staying on paper.
Zuckerberg sold $4.47 billion worth of Meta shares last year, before 2021's tech rout. The stock sales were carried out as part of a pre-set 10b5-1 trading plan, which executives use to allay concerns about insider trading.

(Reuters) -Sculptor Capital Management said on Thursday that a board member resigned in protest over the pay package the hedge fund firm plans to award its chief executive officer James Levin. 
Morgan Rutman, who has been a director since 2019, said he was leaving amid governance failures illustrated by the board's decision to award Levin an annual compensation he called ""staggering"" and ""well in excess of any appropriate comparator.""
Sculptor's compensation committee's consultant, Semler Brossy, said Levin's annual compensation for fiscal year 2021 would ""almost certainly exceed $100 million and may very well approach $200 million,"" Rutman wrote in his resignation letter which was attached to a filing Sculptor made on Thursday evening.
The board approved the committee's recommendation for the CEO pay without trying to benchmark it against peers or compare Levin's performance to other asset managers, Rutman wrote.
Rutman said Levin is among the highest paid CEOs in recent years and is slated to receive an equity interest in Sculptor that would exceed the holdings of the founders of Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc in their respective funds.
Sculptor said Rutman's letter was full of ""inaccuracies"" and ""baseless assertions"" and that all independent directors except Rutman ""believed that the compensation arrangements were in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.""
The New York-based firm, previously called Och-Ziff Capital Management, is one of only a handful of publicly traded hedge fund companies and has a market capitalization of about $1.07 billion. It manages $37.9 billion and its stock price climbed 5% over the last year.
The boardroom battle has overtones of a clash between the company and Daniel Och, who founded it in 1994 and had anointed Levin as his likely CEO successor but then changed his mind in late 2017. Och exited the firm in 2019. Rutman is chief executive officer of Och's personal investment firm. 
Rutman also objected to permitting Wayne Cohen, who reports directly to Levin, to vote for the approval of the compensation package, saying it was a conflict of interest. 
He added the package could not have been approved without Cohen's vote as five votes were required for approval under the company's governance documents.

(Reuters) - Wall Street snapped a four-session winning streak on Thursday, with all three benchmarks ending lower after Facebook-owner Meta Platforms' dour forecast sent its stock plummeting and halted a nascent recovery built on upbeat earnings from other big tech.
Meta shares sank 26.4%, wiping around more than $200 billion off its market value, according to Reuters calculations, as it blamed Apple's privacy changes and increased competition from rivals such as TikTok for its disappointing outlook.
The decline in market capitalization was the largest ever recorded by a U.S. company in a single session, eclipsing when Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shed $180 billion on Sept. 3, 2020.
In turn, Meta's performance eliminated 0.9% of the Nasdaq's value and cut the S&P 500's combined worth by 0.6%, according to Reuters calculations. The exchanges, respectively, suffered their worst daily falls since September 2020 and February 2021. 
Shares of other social media companies also took a beating.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) dropped 5.6%, while Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) slumped 10.3% and 23.6% respectively ahead of reporting their own earnings after the bell.
Big tech stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 3%, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) slumped 7.8%, before it was scheduled to release results.
""As we've gotten numbers in recent days, what we're seeing is the delivery of earnings being rewarded or penalized, and if you continue to deliver strong earnings growth, the market will reward that,"" said Maxwell Grinacoff, U.S. equity & derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Financial technology companies saw a second day of selling, after  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s disappointing earnings on Tuesday caused investors to question if these firms - which benefited significantly from the pandemic advancing the shift to digital payments - would justify steep valuations in 2022.
PayPal dropped 6.2%, while peers Block Inc, Affirm Holdings Inc and SoFi Technologies slipped between 4.9% and 11%.
Tech stocks have enjoyed a dominant period amid low interest rates, as investors sought out high growth, but with inflation rising and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling an aggressive rate-hike stance to rein it in, money managers are having to adjust portfolios accordingly.
""People are going to start increasing allocations to value stocks, and to do that they will have to sell their growth stocks, even if they are down 15% to 30%,"" said Jack Murphy, co-chief investment officer of Easterly Investment Partners.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) - Russia has formulated several options as an excuse to invade Ukraine, including the potential use of a propaganda video showing a staged attack, the United States said on Thursday, as the Kremlin condemned American troop deployments in the region.
Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists in the east of the country, is demanding security guarantees including a promise NATO will never admit Kyiv as it has amassed some 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. 
The United States has said there is little chance of Ukraine joining NATO soon but that the country should decide its own future as the powers clash over their spheres of influence in post-Cold War Europe.
U.S. intelligence believes Russia could use a fabricated video showing the graphic aftermath of an explosion, including equipment appearing to belong to Ukraine or allied nations, to justify an incursion.
It ""would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they (Russia) would have created themselves... (and) deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed,"" U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer told MSNBC. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the reports, according to the TASS news agency, saying similar things had been said previously but amounted to nothing.
Moscow has denied accusations in the past that it is trying to manufacture a conflict and says it is not planning an invasion but that it could take unspecified military action if its security demands are not met.
The Kremlin accused Washington on Thursday of ignoring its calls to ease the standoff, a day after the United States announced it would send nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania.
""It's obvious that these are not steps aimed at de-escalating tensions, but on the contrary they are actions that lead to increasing tension,"" Peskov said on a conference call on Thursday.
""We constantly call on our American counterparts to stop aggravating tensions on the European continent. Unfortunately, the Americans continue to do so,"" he said.
Paratroopers with the U.S. Army boarded aircraft on Thursday to leave for Eastern Europe ""in support of assuring our NATO allies and our partners in deterring Russia,"" U.S. Army spokesman Matthew Visser said.
The soldiers were departing from Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Around 1,700 service members, mainly from the 82nd Airborne Division, were being deployed to Poland, while 300 others will move to Germany, he said.
Washington and NATO have expresses a readiness to discuss arms control and confidence-building measures. Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in the week that Moscow was still interested in dialogue.
RUSSIAN TROOP MOVEMENTS INTO BELARUS
In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said there had been a significant movement of Russian military forces into Ukraine's northern neighbor Belarus in recent days.
The Russia-Belarus joint military drills, running until Feb. 20, have provided Moscow with cover to further increase forces near Ukraine. 
""This is the biggest Russian deployment there since the Cold War,"" said Stoltenberg, adding the expected deployment includes 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operations forces, SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and nuclear-capable Iskander missiles.
The Kremlin has described the Allied Resolve exercises as a rehearsal for repelling external aggression and says its forces will withdraw after the drills.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu arrived in Belarus on Thursday to inspect the troops.
The Belarusian defence minister released images from the exercises showing troops parachuting to the ground, fighter jets in the sky, soldiers dismounting from a helicopter holding weapons, and tanks firing and manoeuvring.
Belarus shares its western border with NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, while Ukraine lies to its south.
WORLD LEADERS KEEP TALKING 
Support for Russia came from China. 
Their two foreign ministers ""coordinated their positions"" during a meeting in Beijing on Thursday, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
China expressed understanding and support for Russia's position on security regarding Russia's relationship with the United States and NATO, it said. 
Putin was set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday before attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics.
The U.S. State Department warned Russia that a closer relationship between Moscow and Beijing would not make up for the consequences of an invasion and only make the Russian economy ""more brittle."" 
Elsewhere, world leaders continued their efforts to resolve the crisis. 
In Kyiv, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy and offered to host a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy.
In a move likely to grate with Moscow, Zelenskiy used the meeting to trumpet a deal enabling Ukrainian factories to produce Turkish drones that have already been deployed in Ukraine's war against Russia-backed rebels in its eastern Donbass region.

In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron said he and Polish President Andrzej Duda had discussed the possibility of a three-way meeting along with Germany's Olaf Scholz in coming days on the situation in Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for Russia to return to a path of ""peace and dialogue"" or face sanctions as the EU worked on a joint response to a letter many of its members received from Russia seeking security guarantees.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning, alongside U.S. equity futures. Strong earnings from Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) helped to counter a rout in technology shares, while concerns about monetary tightening contributed to market volatility.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.11% by 9:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT), while South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.74%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.21%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.87%.
Chinese markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.
U.S. shares were on an upward trend, with Amazon and  Snap Inc  . (NYSE:SNAP) shares climbing thanks to strong earnings during the previous session, slowly recovering from a historic $251 billion wipeout for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) Amazon could add nearly $200 billion in market value should its stocks hold the 14% gain in after-hours trading to Friday’s U.S. close.
Investors also continued to digest surprisingly hawkish comments from European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde and the Bank of England (BOE) hiking its interest rate to 0.5% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday.
Volatility across global markets has been the name of the game in 2022 to date, with central banks tightening monetary policy just as the economic recovery from COVID-19 shows signs of slowing down.
“The first half of 2022, we are now experiencing a rates shock,” Brandywine Global Investment Management portfolio manager Tracy Chen told Bloomberg.
“If the U.S. Federal Reserve, BOE, and other EM central banks are too aggressive in hiking interest rates, potentially we are going to face kind of a recession risk in the second half or at least more slowdown in the economy.”
On the data front, U.S. initial jobless claims were at a lower-than-expected 238,000. The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January was 59.9, while the services PMI was 51.2.
Investors also await the U.S. jobs report for January, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day.
The looming jobs report “is a reminder that expectations for Fed policy are the key influence on this market right now,” Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter, told Bloomberg. If the following week’s inflation data is high, it would “rekindle hawkish Fed concerns,” he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Storm clouds hang over SoftBank Group Corp as it prepares to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with the valuations of top portfolio companies slipping and heavyweights departing the Japanese technology conglomerate.
Major SoftBank assets that went public over the last year and are now trading below their listing price include ridehailing company Didi Global, e-commerce firm Coupang and used-car platform Auto1 Group. 
In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, artificial intelligence firm SenseTime was a bright spot but others, such as Paytm parent One 97 Communications, have disappointed.
""The valuations they've made just haven't held up,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry. ""There's a lot more scepticism."" 
The new year has offered little respite to Chief Executive Masayoshi Son: January was a bruising month, as investors turned away from growth stocks promising future profits. 
""This looks to be a far more critical time for SoftBank than in 2020, when some of its big bets like WeWork and Oyo had gone sour,"" Asymmetric Advisors analyst Amir Anvarzadeh, who recommends shorting the firm, wrote in a note. 
SoftBank is struggling to get investors to reevaluate its shares, which are down by about half since last year's March highs. The group launched a 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) buyback in November. 
""We aren't convinced that anything other than drastic markdowns would allow markets to declare that the downside risk is all priced in,"" LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform.
As the firm winds down its SB Northstar trading arm, it is funneling funds to its second Vision Fund, which has invested smaller sums than its first iteration in more than 150 startups.
One major reason for the group's buyback last year was ongoing executive frustration at the size of the conglomerate discount, or the gap between the value of its assets and its share price. 
The sale of chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which could have unlocked funds for further share repurchases, is widely expected to fall through because of regulatory hurdles. An initial public listing is seen as an alternative but analysts question the prospects for such a move. 
""We are sceptical that an outright IPO of Arm will result in value creation for SBG shareholders,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. 

Other assets include stakes in e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), whose shares have slid drastically as China tech is hammered by regulatory action, and telco SoftBank Corp, which is trading below its listing price.
Top executives, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, have moved to exit the company. The shift cements Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra's pivotal role as SoftBank prioritises investing through that unit.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -A Mexican entrepreneur close to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told Reuters that he has begun hiring financial advisers and law firms to prepare a bid for Citibanamex,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Mexican consumer banking arm.
Javier Garza, founder of a business group which supports Lopez Obrador's left-leaning administration, also said in a Zoom interview that he gets about four calls a day from potential investors.
They include individuals, corporations, funds, and small banks, he said, adding that he is talking to advisers and law firms in the United States and Mexico about a bid for Citibanamex. 
The 73-year-old entrepreneur declined to identify any of the potential investors or specify which advisers he was talking to during the interview late Tuesday, stating it is too early to disclose sensitive information.
Garza has said he wants to return the lender to Mexican hands, mirroring declarations by Lopez Obrador that for the country's No. 3 consumer bank should be ""Mexicanized."" Citibanamex has also drawn interest from Spain's Santander (MC:SAN), Mexico's Grupo Financiero Banorte and others.
Garza criticized both potential bids. 
""Spaniards have not treated us very well and it looks like they're embarking on a second conquest,"" he said with respect to Santander. 
As for Banorte, he said: ""We do not want a concentration that leads to a financial oligopoly.""
Analysts have said that Mexico's largest bank, the local arm of Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), would likely face antitrust issues in buying Citibanamex but Banorte would be unlikely to.
Garza, who owns unlisted construction and infrastructure firm Grupo Gentor, said he would have no trouble raising the $4-to-$8 billion estimated price tag for the bank in a consortium with other local investors. 
""I talk to those who approach me about the interests they have, how much they are willing to invest, the returns they expect,"" he said, adding that one unnamed fund had offered earlier this week to kick in $700 million toward a bid.
The entrepreneur said that among potential investors he has spoken to are migrant advocate groups, who say there is a potential market niche for banks able to address their need to transfer more than $50 billion sent from the United States to Mexico each year.
Garza said he is also open to having Mexico's government take a partial stake if it wishes and that he has held preliminary talks with Lopez Obrador about the bank's cultural assets, which the latter has publicly said must be protected as part of any deal. 
""I met the president and his team. We agreed that assets such as Banamex's cultural heritage can be displayed in a museum,"" he said.
The bank, based in a baroque 18th-century building in the center of Mexico City, oversees several other historic properties and also has an extensive art collection.
""We want to create a Mexican museum where the works are available to the country,"" Garza said.
Mexican Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez said the day after Citigroup announced the planned sale that the government had no interest in acquiring the bank itself.

As for Banamex's business model, he would aim to expand banking services through a broader swathe of the population, only about 40% of which has bank accounts, one of the lowest levels among emerging markets.
""Loans in Mexico are very exclusive and expensive, and it shouldn't be that way,"" he said. ""We have to offer better rates while making sure the bank makes profits for its investors.""

Videogame sales in the United States surged since the start of the pandemic, as people were forced to stay at home amid restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the virus. According to data from research firm NPD, total consumer spending on video games reached a record $60.4 billion in 2021, 8% higher than in 2020.
However, a vaccine-aided return of pre-pandemic habits such as eating in restaurants and meeting in person have hit that momentum.
The videogame publisher said net bookings for ""Call of Duty"" on console and PC declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower premium sales for ""Call of Duty: Vanguard"" compared with the previous edition and lower engagement in ""Call of Duty: Warzone"". 
Rival  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) on Tuesday had lowered its annual adjusted sales forecast and missed quarterly estimates with fewer consumers picking up new gaming titles.

Activision's quarterly adjusted sales stood at $2.49 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.82 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net income for the quarter rose to $564 million, or 72 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $508 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) pulled the veil off its sprawling advertising business for the first time on Thursday, revealing a business larger than that of Google's YouTube.
Amazon reported ad revenue of $9.7 billion for the fourth quarter, up 32% from last year, and $31 billion for the year.
YouTube posted $28.8 billion in ad revenue for 2021.
Analyst Benedict Evans on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) said that made Amazon's ad revenue similar in size to the entire global newspaper industry, and Statista put global newspaper annual ad spending at $29.5 billion.
Amazon, known for e-commerce, has a lucrative cloud business, AWS, and the ad business is seen as extremely profitable, although Amazon did not break out those profit numbers. 
Amazon serves ads on its website and wake screens of some of its tablets, using search queries by its customers to help target ads. Those ads are often by companies selling on its marketplace.
""Selling digital add space is a cash generative nice-to-have in times of uncertainty,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Meta Platforms Inc shattered confidence in the online advertising industry on Wednesday, saying privacy changes by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) had made it harder for advertisers.
An Amazon official however told reporters that brands' ability to reach consumers across its ad properties was ""largely unchanged"" after Apple's changes.
Lund-Yates saw Amazon's ad business more in line with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which also has its own data about customers from its search system, and shrugged off the Apple changes. 

Amazon's ad revenue growth has been decelerating from 88% in the second quarter. But the totals also make it larger by sales than Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which also reported strong results on Thursday.
Pinterest posted revenue of $846.7 million for the fourth quarter and Snap reported $1.3 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate, went to trial against the New York Times on Thursday, in a highly anticipated defamation case that could test long-standing protections for American news media.
Palin, 57, is suing over a 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked her political rhetoric to a 2011 Arizona mass shooting that left six dead and U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords seriously wounded, and which the newspaper later corrected.
In his opening statement, Palin's lawyer Shane Vogt told jurors that his client was fighting an ""uphill battle"" to show the editorial reflected the Times' knowledge it was false and its ""history of bias"" toward her and other Republicans.
The Times' lawyer, David Axelrod, countered in his opening statement that the editorial sought to hold both Democrats and Republicans responsible for inflammatory rhetoric, and said the newspaper acted ""as quickly as possible"" to correct its mistake.
The trial in federal court in Manhattan could become a test of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, which made it difficult for public figures like Palin to prove defamation.
To win, Palin must offer clear and convincing evidence the Times acted with ""actual malice,"" meaning it knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth. She is seeking unspecified damages for alleged harm to her reputation.
Two conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices and some legal scholars have suggested revisiting the Sullivan decision, and Palin has signaled she would challenge it on appeal if she lost.
""What am I trying to accomplish? Justice, for people who expect the truth in the media,"" Palin told reporters as she entered the courthouse.
Headlined ""America's Lethal Politics,"" the disputed June 14, 2017, editorial was published after a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia in which Steve Scalise, a member of the House of Representatives' Republican leadership, was wounded.
The editorial questioned whether the shooting reflected how vicious American politics had become.
It then said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in the 2011 shooting after Palin's political action committee had circulated a map putting Gifford and 19 other Democrats under ""stylized cross hairs."" 
Former editorial page editor James Bennet, who is also a defendant, had added the disputed wording to a draft prepared by Elizabeth Williamson, a colleague on the Times editorial board.
""The key will be showing how the editorial came together,"" said Timothy Zick, a professor and First Amendment specialist at William & Mary Law School. ""Essentially, did the Times do its homework before publishing?""
COVID DELAY
Palin's lawyer Vogt said ""we are not here trying to win your votes for Governor Palin or any of her policies,"" but instead wanted the Times found liable for a ""particularly horrific and debunked"" editorial.
He portrayed Bennet as a ""highly educated career journalist"" who knew the words he added were false, yet did not change them.
""He had his narrative, and he stuck to it,"" Vogt said.
But Axelrod said Bennet did not intend to suggest that Loughner acted because of Palin, or that readers infer a link, and that Bennet would testify about ""exactly what he meant.""
Axelrod also said no one at the Times harbored ill will toward Palin, and the dispute concerned a mere two sentences in a 12-paragraph editorial.
""The editorial was not even about her,"" he said.
Williamson, who still works at the Times, was the trial's first witness.
She said Bennet would have been responsible for fact-checking passages he added, and that she had been unaware of any link between the Virginia shooting and political rhetoric.
Williamson was asked to discuss an email Bennet sent before the editorial, where he asked whether hate speech played a role and suggested it might have before the Giffords shooting.
The trial was delayed from Jan. 24 because Palin tested positive for the coronavirus.
Palin has publicly said she will not get the COVID-19 vaccine. She wore a black mask in the courtroom.
The Times has not suffered a loss in a defamation case in more than half a century.

In calling for Sullivan to be revisited, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has said little historical evidence suggested the actual malice standard flowed from the original meaning of the U.S. Constitution's First and 14th Amendments. 
Another justice, Neil Gorsuch, has said the standard offered an ""ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods"" by a growing number of media that can disseminate sensational information with little regard for the truth.

Investing.com - Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) reported on Thursday fourth-quarter results that missed analysts' forecasts as net bookings were hampered by lower than expected performance in its Activision business.
Activision Blizzard announced earnings per share of $1.25 on revenue of $2.49B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.31 on revenue of $2.83B.
Activision Blizzard shares were flat in after-hours trade following the report.
Net bookings, the number of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically, were $2.49 billion, down from $3.05 billion a year earlier, and below guidance of $2.78 billion. In-game net slid to $1.24 billion from $1.32 billion.
""Fourth quarter net bookings were below our prior outlook, primarily due to lower than expected performance in the Activision segment, which offset record performance at King. Activision Blizzard’s mobile net bookings grew 18% year-over-year and represented 33% of total net bookings in the fourth quarter,"" the company said.
Monthly active users were 371 million in Q4, below the 390 million seen in Q3, and the 397 million a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Sneaker giant  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) sued online reseller StockX in New York federal court on Thursday for selling unauthorized images of Nike shoes, marking the latest lawsuit over digital assets known as non-fungible tokens.
Nike said StockX's NFTs infringe its trademarks and are likely to confuse consumers. Its lawsuit asked for unspecified money damages and an order blocking their sales.
Detroit-based StockX, a platform for reselling sneakers, handbags and other goods, was valued at more than $3.8 billion last year. 
A representative for the company did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Nike or its attorneys.
Nike said StockX last month began selling unauthorized NFTs of its sneakers, telling buyers they would be able to redeem the tokens for physical versions of the shoes ""in the near future."" 
The complaint said StockX has sold over 500 Nike-branded NFTs.
The lawsuit said complaints about the NFTs' ""inflated prices and murky terms of purchase and ownership"" and buyers' doubts about the legitimacy of StockX's model have hurt Nike's business reputation.
Nike said it will release ""a number of virtual products"" later this month in conjunction with the digital art studio RTFKT, which it acquired in December. 

NFTs have recently exploded in popularity, and lawsuits over them have begun to hit U.S. courts. Miramax sued director Quentin Tarantino in November over his plans to auction NFTs related to the 1994 film ""Pulp Fiction,"" which he directed and the studio distributed. 
Last month, Hermes sued artist Mason Rothschild over his ""MetaBirkin"" NFTs of the French company's Birkin bags.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An upstart union supported by international activists on Thursday won an election to represent General Motors (NYSE:GM) workers in central Mexico, opening the door to the prospect of bigger pay rises, inspired by U.S.-backed labor reform.
The election was one of the first under the new Mexican law, which underpins a trade deal with the United States and Canada, and aims to help improve pay by breaking the grip of unions that critics say signed deals with companies behind workers' backs.
The union known as SINTTIA won 78% of the votes cast by several thousand workers at GM's plant in the city of Silao, beating three rivals including Mexico's biggest labor organization that had held the plant contract for 25 years. 
Worker Jesus Barroso said he chose SINTTIA to push out the past union, which he said did little to help its members, a frequent charge by workers and activists about ""protection"" unions that they say prioritize business interests. 
""We're fed up. Being fed up is what's making us take this decision,"" said Barroso, noting he takes home 480 pesos ($23.27) in his daily 12-hour shift after more than a decade at GM.
""I think we have the right to give our families, our kids a better quality of life.""
U.S. lawmakers hailed the vote as a win for Mexican and U.S. workers under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, with U.S. Representatives Bill Pascrell, Earl Blumenauer and Dan Kildee calling it a ""boon to American workers who have suffered from multinational corporations moving jobs offshore.""
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai called the vote a victory for workers. ""The next, and equally critical, stage of the process will be good faith bargaining between General Motors and the new union,"" she said.
GM, which employs 6,300 people in Silao, said it would work with SINTTIA to begin a contract negotiation and thanked employees for voting. 
'BIT BY BIT'
SINTTIA said it was still preparing a pitch, but would like to see raises above inflation, which ended 2021 above 7%.
""For years, we lost so much. Now we'll have to go bit by bit,"" the group's secretary general, Alejandra Morales, told a news conference.
SINTTIA is looking at some of Mexico's few independent auto unions as models to achieve better wages and working conditions. 
At Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s plant in Puebla state, the union has helped ensure average pay of 600 pesos ($29.15) a day for an eight-hour shift.
The AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor organization, said the vote would help set standards across the auto sector.
""This vote represents a rejection of the past,"" AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement.
Still, other auto plants may not get the same scrutiny from U.S. and Mexican officials that helped ensure a fair vote, said Arnulfo Arteaga-Garcia, a professor at Mexico's Metropolitan Autonomous University who was one of 100 election observers.
""It may be a reference, but not automatically,"" he said. ""We can't ring the bells yet.""
U.S. officials threatened to impose tariffs on GM exports last year if the automaker did not protect worker rights after a contract ratification vote at the plant was marred by irregularities, including destroyed ballots. 
In August, GM's Silao workers chose to end their contract with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), which had held the contract since the plant opened in 1995 and is aligned with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Observers said this week's union vote went smoothly overall, although SINTTIA's leader Morales and another female colleague said they received personal threats in the days before the vote.
The CTM won 5% of the vote, while a separate group that critics say has ties to CTM, known as The Coalition, took 17%.
Cecilio, a worker who declined to give his last name, said he voted for SINTTIA and was not surprised the group won.

""For so long, us workers have been waiting for a real change,"" he said.

For the holiday quarter, Amazon earned $14.3 billion, double its net income from a year earlier. That included a pre-tax gain of $11.8 billion from its stake in electric car maker Rivian Automotive.
On the heels of a windfall from greater at-home shopping in the pandemic, Amazon has poured money into its operations to manage disruptions, most recently the Omicron variant of COVID-19. It has marketed signing bonuses to attract hundreds of thousands of workers in a tight labor market, and it has paid more for shipping because it could not get products into the right warehouses.
Now, as analysts have expected And it has more than 200 million paid subscribers to its loyalty club Prime to whom to appeal, Amazon is raising the price of Prime. U.S. monthly fees for the fast-shipping and media service are increasing to $14.99 from $12.99, and annual membership is going up to $139, from $119. The change is effective Feb. 18 for new members and reflects greater benefits such as savings on prescription drugs and faster delivery, Amazon said.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that Amazon expected some members to quit, but retention loss ""hasn't been large in the past."" The annual fees last went up by the same amount four years ago, and four years before that.
Revenue per Prime member ""did grow significantly during the pandemic,"" Olsavsky added.
With more than 200 million members globally, Prime is an incentive to consumers to direct more of their shopping to Amazon. That way, they make the most of their subscriptions. Revenue from such fees for the fourth quarter rose 15% to $8.1 billion.
The company announced no changes for Prime members outside the United States.

AD AND CLOUD BUSINESSES SOAR
Operational disruptions, lost productivity and inflationary pressures contributed to more than $4 billion in costs during the holidays, Olsavsky said. Labor-related challenges would continue, though to a lesser degree, this quarter, and the company's capital expenditures on infrastructure would rise in 2022, he told analysts.
Offsetting softer e-commerce trends, key cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed better than expected. 
""The one clear bright spot for the core business was the continued acceleration in AWS to help bolster a bottom line that was otherwise squeezed, if not for the boost it got from the Rivian investment,"" Insider Intelligence analyst Andrew Lipsman said.
With demand rising for gaming and remote work during the pandemic, AWS posted a 40% increase in revenue to $17.8 billion. Analysts had expected more than $17.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The unit even won a key customer, announcing Thursday an expanded partnership with retailer  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY). AWS has long sought rivals as its marquee clients, such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), to show it is a trustworthy partner and not scooping up competitors' data.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google recently forecast a positive outlook or results for their cloud businesses as well, though research firm Canalys said AWS stayed ahead. It won 33% of cloud infrastructure spend worldwide in the fourth quarter, versus 22% for Microsoft and 9% for Google.
Amazon also broke out ad revenue for the first time, reporting a 32% increase to $9.7 billion for the fourth quarter. That's bigger than the ad sales Alphabet's YouTube reported for the same period.
An Amazon official told reporters that the ability of brands to reach consumers across its ad properties was ""largely unchanged"" after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy tweaks to its operating system.
The changes made it more difficult for brands to target and measure ads on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), for instance, causing parent Meta Platforms Inc to anticipate around a $10 billion hit this year and sending its shares down 26% Thursday.

Still, Amazon forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, projecting between $112 billion and $117 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8%.
Analysts were expecting about $120 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 07:12PM ET</span>",Pinterest results dazzle Wall St as ad business booms,"(Reuters) -Pinterest Inc delivered its first annual net income on Thursday as strong advertising revenue drove its fourth-quarter results past Wall Street expectations and softened the blow from a shrinking user base.
The image-sharing firm's shares surged up to 20% in extended trading, bouncing back from a dismal Thursday session in which tech stocks were rattled by Meta Platforms Inc's disappointing earnings outlook and weak user numbers. 
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)'s monthly active users (MAUs) also declined, dropping 6% to the lowest since June 2020 as the pandemic-driven surge in demand cooled off. 
But the company has doubled down on efforts to boost advertising income, focusing on scaling up video features like Pinterest TV and Idea Pins, and boosting influencer marketing in a space dominated by YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. 
Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said Pinterest was investing in native video content and creator-led content as it believes this adds to engagement and revenue.
""The early data make us cautiously optimistic,"" he said.
Pinterest's revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 20% to $846.7 million, surpassing analysts' estimate of $827 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
 Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) also posted strong results on Thursday as its advertising business bounced back from the effects of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes faster than expected.
However, Pinterest saw a 12% decline in the United States, its home market, following certain changes to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s search algorithm, which limited traffic.
""Engagement headwinds from search algorithm changes and from time spent on competing platforms are more persistent and could potentially disrupt normal seasonal trends,"" Morgenfeld said. 
Pinterest's MAUs - a key metric that shows engagement levels on the website - was 431 million for the quarter, missing estimates of 447.95 million, according to FactSet.

Net income was $175 million, compared with $207.8 million a year earlier. 
Excluding items, it earned 49 cents per share, also higher than estimate of 45 cents.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",Analysis-Facebook usage dips for first time. Will Instagram follow?,"By Paresh Dave and Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - TikTok, the pandemic and mobile data costs in India all helped draw people away from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at an unprecedented rate last quarter. The big question is when will it be Instagram's turn?
One forecaster, Insider Intelligence, does not expect Meta Platforms Inc's Instagram social media service to lose users in the next three years. But its November estimates show Instagram's growth in monthly users will fall to 5.8% this year and 3.1% by 2025 from 16.5% last year.
Instagram, which the tech giant acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has been viewed as an antidote to slowing growth at Facebook, with revenue from ads on Instagram increasingly crucial to Meta. 
The company is putting those funds toward building out a new business selling virtual-reality goggles and related metaverse technologies. A decline in Instagram users and inability to raise ad prices could halt Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions.
Fewer people checked their Facebook every day per quarter than they did the year before for the first time ever during the last three months of 2021, Meta said on Wednesday. It was one of several troubling signs, along with profit below expectations and a disappointing revenue outlook, that dropped shares over 26% on Thursday.
Meta Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner on Wednesday told financial analysts part of the usage decrease for the main Facebook app and website came from fewer COVID-19 lockdowns, which have tended to generate a boom in online activity. He also blamed rising internet costs for consumers in India and increasing interest in ByteDance Inc's video-sharing app TikTok.
Meta does not regularly break out usage of Instagram, but analysts say TikTok is hurting Instagram's growth, too. 
Facebook and, to a degree, Instagram have overcome challenges before, including data privacy disasters, scrutiny over the wellbeing of users and competition from  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)'s Snapchat,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and many others over the years. 

Indeed, Instagram is investing billions of dollars into video-related features, such as a TikTok-style option called Reels. Zuckerberg told analysts Wednesday that Reels was its fastest growing content format “by far” and the biggest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram.
Analysts say Reels eventually could become a bigger revenue-generator than ads set against photo and text posts. But in a nod to the challenge ahead, Zuckerberg noted, Reels is not popular enough yet to attract the ad sales that older features do.

It is the first major Canadian lender to set a concrete return-to-office date following the lifting of COVID restrictions in Ontario, the country's most populous province and home to its five biggest banks. 
The timetable for a return to bank premises will differ by groups, teams and geographies, the spokesperson for Canada's fourth-biggest bank said by email. 
Bloomberg reported the plans on Wednesday.
Most of Canada's major banks put their return-to-office plans on hold late last year following the resurgence of the Omicron variant.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest lender, will also vary its return-to-office plans by business and region, and will continue to allow rapid testing as an alternative to vaccinations in certain circumstances, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. 
Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia said they have not updated their plans. 

Financial firms in the United States are also starting to bring employees back to offices, after their plans too were scuppered by the variant. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Jeffries have begun bringing employees back;  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expect to do so this month; and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) plan to bring staff back in March.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 06:10PM ET</span>",Meta's share price wipe-out shakes world tech stocks,"By Danilo Masoni, Akash Sriram and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta plummeted 26% on Thursday, the biggest single-day slide in market value for a U.S. company, after the social media giant issued a dismal forecast, blaming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes and increased competition.
The huge drop, erasing over $200 billion from Meta's market capitalization and around $29 billion from Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's net worth, spilled over to the broader technology sector and dragged the Nasdaq Composite Index lower. It was the biggest slide in market value for a U.S. public company, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data.
(Graphic: A record-setting plunge, https://graphics.reuters.com/META-ZUCKERBERG/byvrjxmowve/chart.png)
It marked the company's worst one-day loss since its Wall Street debut in 2012.
""Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be keen to coax the world into an alternate reality, but disappointing fourth-quarter results were quick to burst his metaverse bubble,"" said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Big U.S. tech-focused companies have come under mounting pressure in 2022 as investors expect policy tightening at the U.S. Federal Reserve to erode the industry's rich valuations following years of ultra-low interest rates. The Nasdaq, which is dominated by tech and other growth stocks, fell more than 9% in January, its worst monthly drop since the coronavirus-induced market crash in March 2020.
""The downgrade in the earnings outlook by Meta and other companies took markets by surprise,"" said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London.
""The tech selloff spilled over to broader equity markets this morning and with the Fed preparing to raise interest rates, we could see more volatility going forward,"" he said.
After the market closed, social media platforms Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) posted strong quarterly reports that sent their shares soaring 17% and 52%, respectively, more than reversing losses from earlier in the day. Their reports also sent Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) up 8%, and helped Meta recover 1%.
Meta was a widely held stock by various investor groups, including hedge funds, according to recent data, leaving a number of funds potentially exposed by the wipe-out in its shares. Other institutional investors were also heavy owners.
It was also a popular stock for retail investors, who appeared to be enthusiastically buying the dip. 
Some portfolio managers also saw a reason to buy. David Jeffress, portfolio manager at Laffer Tengler Investments, said on Thursday the firm is looking to add to its stake in Meta as the stock declines. Jeffress pointed to strong or increasing numbers Meta reported for user engagement, advertising and revenue per user.
""The results, taken in their entirety, were okay. It was the guidance that spooked people,"" Jeffress said. He called the trading declines ""an overreaction."" 
The stock's drop was in addition a boon for investors betting on a decline in the company's shares. Short sellers in Meta were poised to increase their potential 2022 gains to more than $2 billion with Thursday's plunge, according to S3 Partners.
With Big Tech firms like Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ballooning in valuations in the past few years, they have also become more susceptible to investor whiplash, often resulting in losses worth tens of billions of dollars in a single day of trade.
Apple shed nearly $180 billion on Sep. 3, 2020, while Microsoft lost $177 billion on March 16 in the same year.
Meta reported a decline in daily active users from the previous quarter for the first time as competition with rivals like TikTok, the video sharing platform owned by China's ByteDance, heats up.
The disappointment over Meta's earnings and the subsequent stock fall invoked memories of the bursting tech bubble in 2000.
Investors seem to be becoming highly selective after the sector's record-breaking run in recent months.
According to research firm Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA), purchases from retail investors in late 2020 and early 2021 were focused on expensive tech, EVs and so-called ""meme"" stocks. In the past week purchases of large-cap tech have skyrocketed while speculative assets have seen very little demand.

Other social media stocks were also hit hard on Thursday, including Twitter, Pinterest and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). Spotify has been beset by a row over COVID-19 vaccination misinformation and also released disappointing results.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",Ford shares skid despite a bullish 2022 outlook,"By Joseph White and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co ended 2021 with $36 billion in cash, a crop of hot-selling new electric vehicles and a bullish forecast for revenue and profit growth this year, but that was not enough for investors.
Ford shares dipped as much as 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the automaker's fourth-quarter income fell short of analysts' expectations and the company forecast a slower recovery in 2022 vehicle production than rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
The sour response to Ford's results presents a challenge to Chief Executive Jim Farley, who is trying to accelerate the company's pivot toward electric vehicles.
Ford said it has 275,000 orders for its electric F-150 Lightning, Transit vans and Mustang Mach-E utility vehicles, and expects to double electric vehicle production capacity to 600,000 vehicles a year by 2023.
Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said during a call with reporters that Ford expects 2022 earnings before interest and taxes to grow by 15% to 25%, outpacing the predicted 10-15% increase in vehicle production. Ford should hit an 8% pretax profit margin this year, a year ahead of schedule, he said.
But investors sold shares after Ford's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents fell 19 cents short of the 45 cents analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
Earlier this week, General Motors forecast https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-sees-2022-operating-profit-13-bln-15-bln-2022-02-01 a 25-30% production increase for this year compared with last year, and operating profit of $13 billion-$15 billion.
""While the 4Q print is a disappointment, we believe the more critical takeaway from the print is a solid ’22 guide,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note. 
Lawler said the fourth-quarter result reflected worse-than-expected supply-chain problems.
""There are supply-chain disruptions that can impact any one of us in a quarter,"" he said. ""You have to look at long term.""
Ford enters 2022 in a stronger financial position than it has enjoyed in years. The company said it has $36 billion in cash and $52 billion in liquidity. Those numbers include Ford's stake in electric truck and van maker Rivian Automotive Inc, valued at $10.6 billion at the end of 2021. 
Despite a forecast that costs for steel, resins and other raw materials will rise as much as $1.5 billion to $2 billion, Lawler said Ford is confident it can boost production and hold strong prices to deliver pretax profit between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion.
Ford plans to use some of its cash hoard to ramp up capital spending in 2022 to $7 billion to $8 billion from $6.2 billion in 2021, and execute $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion in restructuring.

For all of 2021, Ford reported an operating profit of $10 billion, and an operating margin of 7.3% for the year. Full-year net income of $17.9 billion included a gain on its investment in Rivian.
Fourth-quarter net income rose to $12.3 billion from a $2.8 billion loss a year ago. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes rose to $2.0 billion from $1.7 billion a year ago.

Snap rocketed 62% higher after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter user growth and provided an outlook that surpassed analyst estimates.
Also after the bell, Pinterest soared 25% after its quarterly revenue beat estimates as retailers splurged on advertising during the holiday quarter.
Both of those late-day rallies more than made up for double-digit percentage losses in the stocks Thursday's trading session. 
Shares of Twitter, which reports its quarterly results on Feb. 10, jumped 10% following the reports from Snap and Pinterest. It had lost 5.6% during Thursday's session.
Meta Platforms' shares bounced back 1.6% after the social media heavyweight plunged 26% during the day's trading session.
""All the people who sold Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ... where do you go with that money? You go to similar companies that haven't reported the same type of problem,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

Fidelity's online retail brokerage customers were net buyers of Snap shares earlier on Thursday ahead of the company's report, according to data on the company's website.
Adding more positive sentiment to the U.S. stock market following Thursday's 3.7% slump in the Nasdaq, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) surged 16% after reporting quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. That added about $245 billion the Amazon's stock market value.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Scopia Capital Management on Thursday said it now owns a bigger stake in Verra Mobility (NASDAQ:VRRM) Corp and plans to keep close tabs on the technology company's strategy only weeks after it handed a board seat to another activist investor.
New York-based Scopia, already one of Verra Mobility's 10 largest investors, said it increased its ownership to 5%, or 7.8 million shares, from 4.4%, in a regulatory filing.
Scopia said it plans to talk to the board and management about ways to boost Verra Mobility's share price but stopped short of making any specific recommendations. In the future, however, the filing said, the hedge fund could suggest changes in strategy, including calling for a sale of the company.
A representative for Verra Mobility, which provides technology solutions to governments and school districts to make mobility safer and easier, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Mesa, Arizona-based company is valued at $2.5 billion and its stock price has gained 15% in the last 52 weeks.
Scopia had $2.6 billion in assets under management at the end of 2020, according to a regulatory filing made in 2021.
The words in Scopia's filing echo language used by Inclusive Capital Partners, the investment firm founded by Jeffrey Ubben who cemented his reputation as a collaborative activist while running ValueAct Capital for two decades, last year.
Inclusive, which had $1.3 billion in assets at the end of 2020, began buying its 6.7% stake in Verra Mobility in August and by the end of December one of the firm's partners, Sarah Farrell, was given a board seat.
As activists hunt for targets, it has become more common for several to invest in the same company. Recently, Starboard Value took a position in Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) where Jana Partners is already pushing for change.

(Reuters) -Snap Inc on Thursday said its advertising business bounced back from the effects of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes faster than it expected, and shares of the company skyrocketed 50% as it provided a first quarter outlook that surpassed analyst estimates.
The results were good news for a tech sector hammered since yesterday on gloomy outlooks and concern that Apple's privacy updates, which were introduced last year and allow users to prevent apps from tracking their online activity for advertising purposes, would hurt ad revenue.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) forecast first-quarter revenue between $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion, and daily active users to be between 328 million to 330 million. The guidance for both metrics surpassed analyst estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Digital pinboard company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc also reported higher-than-expected revenue on Thursday and its shares rose 20%.
The earnings reports from both Snap and Pinterest contrast with that of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc, whose shares fell 26% https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-platforms-frankfurt-listed-shares-drop-tepid-forecast-2022-02-03 on Thursday in what could be the largest single-day wipeout in market value for a U.S. company, a day after it said the impact https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-forecasts-q1-revenue-below-estimates-2022-02-02 from Apple's privacy changes could be ""in the order of $10 billion"" this year.
Meta said the Apple updates hurt advertisers' ability to target ads to potential customers and measure the effectiveness of ads.
A large portion of Snap's advertisers began using new ad measurement tools by the end of the fourth quarter, and parts of Snap's advertising business began to recover from the Apple changes ""quicker than we anticipated,"" said Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen, in prepared remarks released ahead of the earnings call with analysts.
However, global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages hurt advertising demand from consumer packaged goods and restaurant brands, he added.
Snap's revenue for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 42% from the prior-year quarter. The figure beat analyst expectations of $1.2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Daily active users on Snapchat rose 20% year-over-year to 319 million, beating consensus estimates of 316.5 million.

Snap still has a long runway for growth compared to larger tech rivals. It has developed a strategy https://www.reuters.com/technology/snap-plays-up-augmented-reality-latin-america-asia-expansion-2022-01-21 to attract new users across Latin America, Europe and Asia. Meta reported Wednesday that Facebook has 2.91 billion monthly users globally, which showed no growth compared with the previous quarter. 
Snap also reported its first quarter of positive net income since its initial public offering, with earnings of $22.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $113 million in the prior-year quarter.

Investing.com - Skyworks Solutions reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as ongoing demand for 5G continued to bolster chip revenue. 
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) was down about 2.3% in afterhours following the report.

934,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 05:00PM ET</span>","Jobs Report, Pharma Earnings, Royal Caribbean - 3 Things To Watch","By Daniel Shvartsman
Investing.com – Whatever the volatile start to trading in 2022 can tell us about the state of the market, one old stand-by has held true – the mega-cap tech stocks, represented by FAANG or FAAMNG or whatever other acronym, lead the overall market for higher or for lower.
Netflix’s disappointing earnings came during the worst of market selling. Microsoft’s impressive earnings report the next week more or less coincided with the correction’s bottom (at least so far); Apple’s helped push the market back in the positive direction.
And this week, the market has seemed to follow the tone of each market giant that has reported – Alphabet’s sterling Q4 pushed markets higher on Wednesday, before Meta Platforms’ dour guidance dragged the Nasdaq down 3%.
All of which is a long way of saying that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the latest on the bump with their post-earnings report today. The report met revenue expectations and had an EPS beat fueled by the company’s Rivian stake, but even with muted guidance the stock is soaring after-hours at this writing. A sign of where the market goes tomorrow?
Here are three things to watch in markets tomorrow beyond the Amazon reaction:
Expectations for nonfarm payrolls have ratcheted down after the weak ADP jobs report – with 301K jobs lost in January – and murmurings from the Biden administration warning that this may be a disappointing report. Jobless claims actually came in below expectations today, which may be a tea leaf in favor of that interpretation: jobs numbers will be poor and weird due to temporary time off from Omicron related illness, as the milder COVID-19 variant still wrought havoc on work schedules and health of people around the country and world.
The mean expectation from analysts is for the report to show 150K new jobs. lGoldman Sachs wrote in a note that they expect a drop of 250K jobs due to omicron related absenteeism. As ever, what the market is pricing in at this stage remains to be seen.
While big tech names have cleared the decks in a raucous start to earnings season, there is a good batch of pre-market earnings to close out the week. Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is expected to show 9% revenue growth and 23% reported earnings per share growth;  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) is slated for a more muted 4% EPS and revenue growth; and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) is expected to post revenue growth of 86% and EPS growth of 110%.
Amid a week that may show both Omicron headwinds on the job side and end of the pandemic – at least as a market factor – on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) side, Royal Caribbean’s earnings should make for an interesting read-through to the travel sector and projected recovery.
 Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) is expected to boast $1.03B in revenue, many times above last year’s still in the pandemic number, but that is still barely 40% of the two years ago quarter. So the cruise line’s outlook will be telling for whether its peers and the travel and services sectors at large are ready to set sail again."

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said at a news conference that he has given the company until March to respond to an offer of facilities to develop a tourism project in the area in exchange for withdrawing its complaint and halting mining activities in the area.
U.S.-based Vulcan, a leading producer of gravel, sand and crushed stone, operates in Mexico through its Calica unit, which has several concessions in the southeastern state of Quintana Roo, where it mines crushed limestone that is later shipped to the United States, where it is used in construction.
During the same news conference, Interior Minister Adan Agusto Lopez specified that there are three Vulcan properties in the area, two of which are in operation, one with a concession with no time limit and the other with an expired permit, while the authorization to operate in the third is about to end.
Neither Vulcan nor Calica responded to requests for comment on the dispute or details of the potential settlement or the suit itself. The Mexican economy ministry also could not be reached for comment. 
The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes' (ICSID) website mentions a 2019 claim for $500 million filed by Vulcan against Mexico that is still pending resolution.
According to an excerpt of the lawsuit on the ICSID site, Vulcan is protesting ""the revocation by government agencies of the port concession of the plaintiff's wholly owned subsidiary, Calica, and the forced closure of extraction operations"" of two facilities in the area. 
Lopez Obrador, who reported that the area involved occupies 4,200 hectares (10,400 acres) near the resort, has previously threatened to complain to the United Nations about the area's ""destruction"" as a result of Vulcan's mine, although on Thursday he toned down his remarks. 
""I hope that an agreement is reached, which is going to be the best,"" he said.

Investing.com —  Snap Inc  's (NYSE:SNAP) shares rocketed 53% after hours Thursday, in reaction to its fourth-quarter earnings after posting a beat on earnings and revenue and guidance for the current quarter above consensus expectations.
The social media company, whose shares declined 23% in the regular session, announced earnings per share of $0.22 on revenue of $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of -$0.09 on revenue of $1.2 billion. This was Snap's first ever quarterly profit on a net income basis.
Daily active users came in at 319 million in Q4, representing a 54 million gain, or 20% increase year-over-year. Daily active user growth year-over-year has been 20% or more for five consecutive quarters.
The company sees Q1 revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.08 billion, with the range coming in above consensus estimates of $1.02 billion. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be approximately breakeven.
“2021 was an exciting year for Snap and we made significant progress growing our business and serving our global community,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO. 
Spiegel added that the strength of its core business allowed them to speed up investments in augmented reality.
Snap had come into the report with muted expectations after Meta Platforms' headline miss and muted guidance yesterday led to a market-wide and sector-specific sell-off. Shares closed down more than 70% from 52-week highs amidst doubts that the company had real growth in its future, a fear this report at least allayed if not totally dispelled. "

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Wednesday applied for a permit to extend its existing Austin-based car factory with a building to produce cathodes for battery manufacturing, according to city filings and a spokeswoman.
An application submitted on Wednesday for an Austin building permit under the program name ""Cathode"" listed the Colorado River Project LLC as a co-applicant. That is the name Tesla has used throughout the permitting process for its new Texas factory on the state and local level.
""I can confirm that this is for the Tesla project and this permit is for a cathode building,"" a spokeswoman for the city's development services department said on Thursday, adding that the city did not have further information.
News site Electrek first reported on the filing on Thursday.
The new building would extend Tesla's existing vehicle factory located on the eastern outskirts of Austin near the airport. According to the city filing, it would have the size of nearly 1.6 million square feet.
The electric carmaker began manufacturing vehicles at the factory on the eastern outskirts of Austin earlier this year. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk in September said Tesla plans to build a cathode facility as part of its battery cell production plant.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality on Jan. 20 approved Tesla's vehicle manufacturing site. The carmaker still has several other permits pending with the commission, which needs to provide air quality permits for polluting manufacturing sites.

In 2020 filings with the Commission, Tesla said its emissions sources for battery cell production would include anode and cathode mixing dust.
Cathodes are the single most expensive component of a battery and producing them requires lots of space and emits large quantities of CO2 emissions.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Thursday, snapping a four-day win streak as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms' biggest one-day plunge ever, triggered a sea of red across stocks. 
The S&P 500 fell 2.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.5 %, or 518 points, the Nasdaq slipped 3.7%.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) reported fiscal-fourth quarter results that missed on the bottom line as it failed to grow users for the first time, and signaled more pain ahead.
The social media giant flagged rising competition from TikTok, the impact of Apple's iOs changes, and costs associated with funding its foray into the metaverse as headwinds. Apple last year introduced changes to its iPhone operating system that gave users the option to block apps from accessing the identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, used by advertisers to track users and serve them ads on their iPhones.
{{0)|Oppenheimer}} cut its target on Meta to $375 from $405, forecasting lower growth estimates from the longer-than-expected  ""IDFA workaround [...] combined with a strategic push of engagement to Reels—to combat TikTok—albeit at lower monetization and FX headwinds."" {{0|JPMorgan, meanwhile, downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform.
Meta’s disappointing quarterly results sent shockwaves across the social media stocks Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), both of which report after the closing bell, down about 23% and 10% respectively, while Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fell more than 5%.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which also reports results after the closing bell, was down more than 7%,  
The renewed selling in growth stocks like tech has cast doubt on whether the recent revival in growth has faded, but some suggest that further selling will subside as the broader market is nearing a bottom.
“I think we're in the seventh inning of a nine-inning game of the selloff in growth stocks … you've had a lot of damage done,” Chief Strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management Rhys Williams told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.
But it wasn’t all doom and gloom on the earnings front, with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) upbeat guidance and better-than-expected earnings that overshaded revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Its shares jumped 10%.
Cyclical stocks like energy and financials were in the red, but outperforming the broader market selloff, with latter supported by climb in bank stocks as 10-year yields flirted with 1.9%.
Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Invesco  (NYSE:IVZ) and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT) were more than 1% higher.
On the economic front, jobless claims fell more than expected last month ahead of the monthly nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The jobs on Friday, however, could prove somewhat of nothingburger as many are bracing for weaker data following the impact of the omicron.
“I don’t think  this nonfarm payroll report will have a major impact on markets as people aren’t expecting a great number,” Williams said. Economists are forecasting the economy added 150,000 jobs last month. "

946,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 04:01PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers blast agencies over 5G C-Band aviation spectrum 'ridiculousness',"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Thursday blasted two federal agencies for failing to avoid an embarrassing last-minute standoff between the aviation and wireless industries over 5G C-Band deployment and airplane interference, with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration conceding ""we need to do better as a country.""
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson testified before the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee during a hearing in which lawmakers voiced frustration with his agency and the Federal Communications Commission and asked why the standoff was not resolved earlier.
Representative Garret Graves, the subcommittee's top Republican, said the FAA and FCC played ""chicken with one another - or whatever ridiculousness happened - and now we ended up threatening aviation safety. We had flights canceled. ... It's embarrassing.""
The rollout took place on Jan. 19, but only after  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying about 510 5G wireless towers near airports in light of safety concerns.
Dickson testified that federal agencies need to improve their coordination in such matters because there will be additional spectrum issues in the future.
""The process did not serve anyone well,"" Dickson said. ""It did not serve the aviation community well, certainly the FAA, and it also did not serve the telecommunications industry well. And we certainly need to do better as a country.""
The aviation industry and FAA had warned that 5G interference could impact sensitive airplane electronics such as radio altimeters, which gauge the height of an aircraft above terrain immediately below it and are used in low visibility landings. 
Airlines CEOs on Jan. 17 had warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment. The delay by Verizon and AT&T did not prevent dozens of foreign carriers from canceling international flights to the United States, and it cast the U.S. regulatory system in an ugly light.
""The key to all of this is early and very transparent data exchange,"" Dickson said, saying this began in earnest between the aviation and wireless industries only in late December.
Dickson said the FAA could have new standards for radio altimeters in about a year. The FAA has cleared 20 altimeter models and approved 90% of the U.S. commercial fleet for landing in low-visibility approaches in areas with C-Band 5G. 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, told the hearing that recent events show ""the current interagency process for auctioning off spectrum is completely broken.""
DeFazio said aviation safety needs must be prioritized.
""Having a dropped call is way less serious than having a dropped airplane out of the sky,"" DeFazio said.
Wireless industry group CTIA CEO Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Attwell Baker said she did not understand ""how this didn't get resolved"" at least before the December 2020 C-Band auction. She said wireless carriers followed all the rules as they spent $80 billion on the auction to win the spectrum.
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel was invited to appear on Thursday but could not attend, citing a schedule conflict. Rosenworcel said at a news conference last month that ""as we use more of our wireless airways for commercial activity we are going to have to engage in more coordination early and often.""

Republican Representative John Katko pressed Dickson on why it took so long for the FAA and FCC to enter into an information-sharing agreement.
""You knew this was bubbling up for a long time,"" Katko said. ""How the hell did we get to the point where we had so much brinkmanship going on with this? We had five years in the making.""

Investing.com – Standard Lithium stock (NYSE:SLI) dropped more than 27% Thursday after Hindenburg Research released a short report questioning the company's direct-lithium-extraction (DLE) technology and overall story.
The stock touched a low of $5.82 in the session that’s currently underway and was just above $6/share as of publication.
Hindenburg said Standard has ""no revenue, unproven technology, and a team stacked with seasoned stock promoters"".
In a detailed report posted on its website, Hindenburg leveled serious allegations against the company and its CEO Robert Mintak. According to the short seller, Mintak has been involved with at least nine publicly traded companies.
“On average, shares of these companies have fallen ~97%. Of the 9 companies, 5 have been delisted, several have faced regulatory scrutiny, none operate profitably, and at least 8 used paid stock promotion,” it said.
Hindenburg alleges that since going public in July 2021, the company has spent over C$5 million (around $4M) on “advertising and investor relations” compared to about C$1.7 million on R&D. In financial year 2021, its R&D budget dropped to zero, Hindenburg claimed.
“We show that Standard’s executives and board also have ties to companies whose stocks spiked on the back of paid stock promotion before ultimately plummeting,” it said.
Standard Lithium issued a press release in response, calling the report false and misleading, and alleging that Hindenburg's R&D calculations omit, ""the CDN $ 29,409,930 spent on the various pilot and demonstration plants that has been capitalized, (and) the CDN $ 6,932,598 spent on operating expenses at our pilot and demonstration plant."" The shares ended the day at $5.29, the lowest close since August 2021.
Hindenburg Research has produced a number of short reports over the last few years, including cases against Nikola, Clover, Lordstown Motors, and Technoglass.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc was widely held by hedge funds, according to recent data, leaving a number of funds potentially exposed by the wipe-out in its shares. 
Shares of Meta on Thursday touched their lowest level since July 2020 after the social media giant issued a dismal forecast in which it blamed increased competition and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes.
Meta was the third most important position for hedge funds, behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the third quarter of 2021, according to an analysis of U.S. regulatory filings compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a summary of which was sent to Reuters. Goldman Sachs could not be immediately reached for comment.
""The value destruction is pretty large and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has certainly been a core holding of many funds, traditional and long-short,"" said Jim Neumann, chief investment officer of alternatives advisory firm Sussex Partners.
Funds including Wellington Management Group, Sanders Capital and Tiger Global Management declared positions at the end of September, as well as Polen Capital Management, Lone Pine Capital, Soroban Capital Partners, Egerton Capital and Marshall Wace, the most recent filings showed.
Together, those eight hedge funds held more than 62 million shares as of Sept. 30, the most recent U.S. regulatory filings showed, which means they could have lost more than $5 billion in paper profits - if they still held those positions and had not hedged them.
When it came to broader investors The Vanguard Group, Fidelity Management & Research Company, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Institutional Trust Company, T. Rowe Price Associates and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors were the top five institutional shareholders over the same time period, according to Refinitiv data.
Capital International Investors, Capital World Investors, Capital Research Global Investors, Geode Capital Management and Norges Bank Investment Management made up the rest of the top 10.
Spokespeople for Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Capital International Investors, Capital Research Global Investors and Norges declined to comment. None of the other firms were immediately available to comment. Together they held more than 802.72 million shares.
Sussex Partners' Neumann added it's also possible that funds took some risk off by hedging or reducing prior to earnings announcements.
""It will not be lost on the managers that the earning misses and forecast disappointments of the current period have been met with violent reaction, most pronounced when the company is reliant upon forward earnings rather than current."" 

Spokespeople for Wellington, Marshall Wace, Lone Pine and Soroban declined to comment while Sanders, Tiger Global, Polen and Egerton were not immediately available for comment.
The latest data on hedge fund holdings, which will detail the fourth quarter, is expected in mid-February.

The single European currency rose as high as $1.1452, the highest since Jan. 14, and was last up 1.2% at $1.1441. The euro was on track for its largest daily percentage gain since early December 2020.
Lagarde acknowledged on Thursday that euro zone inflation was running hotter than expected, with risks tilted to the upside. She also said the ECB, which left policy rates unchanged at Thursday's meeting, would not rush into new moves.
When asked if the ECB was ""very unlikely"" to raise rates this year, Lagarde said it would assess conditions very carefully and be ""data-dependent.""
Euro zone money markets are currently pricing an 80% chance of a 10 basis-point hike in June and an almost 100% chance of 40 bps of hikes by year-end, from a 90% chance of 30 bps hikes before Lagarde's press conference. [IRPR]
""President Lagarde adopted a dramatically more hawkish tone in the press conference than on any previous occasion,"" wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist, at Capital Economics.
""Most significantly, she pointedly refused to repeat her view that rate hikes this year are 'very unlikely,' or even 'unlikely.' In effect, she was telling investors that she now thinks a rate hike this year is likely,"" he added.
Sterling climbed to a two-year peak versus the euro after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5% on Thursday, with nearly half of its policymakers pushing for a bigger increase to contain surging inflation.
The British pound later fell versus the euro after Lagarde's hawkish turn. The euro was last up 0.1% at 84.09 pence. Against the dollar, sterling rose 0.2% to $1.3598.
The dollar index, with the euro as the largest component, dropped 0.7% to 95.311, on course for its biggest daily loss since May 2021.
The Federal Reserve remains on course to lift interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March, with about five hikes seen this year, according to Refinitiv data.
Fed funds futures have also priced in a roughly 20% chance of 50 basis-point hike at the March meeting.
The January non-farm payrolls report will be released on Friday, although the data won't be as crucial for the Fed as in the past, as the focus is more on inflation rather than full employment.
""There also is a strong likelihood that Omicron dented employment last month measurably, as was reflected in the ADP (private payrolls) report and other January data,"" said Action Economics in its blog.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls are forecast to show a gain of 150,000 jobs for January, down from 199,000 in December, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9%, according to a Reuters poll.

Investing.com — Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on audio products developer and manufacturer  Sonos Inc  (NASDAQ:SONO) Thursday, telling investors in a note that they see a buying opportunity.
Sonos shares are trading just below $25/share after a 27% fall in the last three months. Morgan Stanley points out this is, ""despite the fact that consensus FY22 EBITDA has been revised 48% higher over the last 12 months.""
""The market appears to be pricing in a 15-20% cut to FY22 Adj. EBITDA,"" added the investment bank. They argued that the market is also undervaluing the long-term durability of the company's ecosystem.
Sonos has an ""asymmetrically skewed positive risk/reward"", and is ""a high quality, long-term compounder at a significant discount to fair value,"" analyst Erik Woodring argued.
Sonos shares are down nearly 3% Thursday despite the note, in line with the broader tech sector."

953,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 02:46PM ET</span>",Jump Trading replaces stolen Wormhole funds after $320 million crypto hack,"By Tom Wilson and Pushkala Aripaka
LONDON (Reuters) - The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading said on Thursday it had restored more than $320 million to crypto platform Wormhole after the decentralized finance site was hit with one of the largest crypto heists on record. 
In a tweet, Jump Crypto said they chose to replace the stolen money ""to make community members whole and support Wormhole now as it continues to develop.""
Chicago-based Jump Trading acquired Certus One, the developer behind Wormhole, in August. 
Wormhole, an online platform that allows the transfer of information across crypto networks, said on Wednesday it had been ""exploited"" for 120,000 digital tokens connected to the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether. 
At the time of its announcement, the market value of the tokens was just over $320 million.
The theft was the latest to hit the fast-growing but mostly unregulated DeFi sector. DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow and save - usually in crypto - while bypassing traditional gatekeepers of finance such as banks. 
""All funds have been restored and Wormhole is back up,"" the platform said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) after earlier saying on its Telegram channel that ""all funds are safe"". 
London-based blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said that attackers were able to fraudulently create the wETH tokens, almost 94,000 of which were later transferred to the ethereum blockchain, which powers transactions for ether.
Elliptic added that Wormhole has offered the attacker a $10 million ""bounty"" to return the funds, citing messages embedded within ether transactions sent to the attacker's digital address. 
MAJOR HACKING RISK 
Cash has poured into DeFi sites, mirroring the explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies as a whole. Many investors, facing historically low or sub-zero interest rates, are drawn to DeFi by the promise of high returns on savings. 
Yet with their breakneck growth, DeFi platforms have emerged as a major hacking risk, with bugs in code and design flaws allowing criminals to target DeFi sites and deep pools of liquidity, and also to launder the proceeds of crime, while leaving few traces. 
Fraud and theft at DeFi platforms surpassed $10 billion last year, research by Elliptic shows, laying bare the risks in the fast-growing but mostly unregulated area of cryptocurrencies.

Last August, hackers behind likely the biggest ever digital coin heist returned nearly all of the $610 million-plus they stole from the DeFi site Poly Network.
Hacks have long plagued crypto platforms. In 2018, digital tokens worth some $530 million were stolen from Tokyo-based platform Coincheck. Mt. Gox, another Japanese exchange, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole half a billion dollars of crypto.

 IBM  is deploying the quantum computer known as IBM Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) System One in Canada for the first time, which is expected to be available for use at its facility in Bromont, Quebec by early 2023, Anthony Annunziata, IBM's director of accelerated discovery, said in an interview.
The partnership with Quebec would integrate quantum computing with cloud technologies, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle broader challenges like the environment.
""Batteries are very tough to build and improve. We've been working on them for decades and progress is slow, incremental,"" he said.
""If we bring AI and quantum into the picture, that can start to change and we can actually start to understand what's happening at the heart of batteries and understand new materials and new processes to build much better ones.""
The United States and other nations are in a race to develop quantum technology, which could fuel advances in artificial intelligence, materials science and chemistry.
Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.

The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be 'superposed' on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed. 
Annunziata said IBM has partnerships with similar objectives in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 remained under pressure Thursday, as a plunge in Facebook-parent Meta Platforms put growth stocks back into the crosshairs following a recent revival.
The S&P 500 fell 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.8 %, or 291 points, the Nasdaq slipped 2.7%.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) reported fiscal-fourth quarter results that missed on the bottom line as it failed to grow users for the first time, and signaled more pain ahead.
The social media giant flagged rising competition from TikTok, the impact of Apple's iOs changes, and costs associated with funding its foray into the metaverse as headwinds. Apple last year introduced changes to its iPhone operating system that gave users the option to block apps from accessing the identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, used by advertisers to track users and serve them ads on their iPhones.
{{0)|Oppenheimer}} cut its target on Meta to $375 from $405, forecasting lower growth estimates from the longer-than-expected  ""IDFA workaround [...] combined with a strategic push of engagement to Reels—to combat TikTok—albeit at lower monetization and FX headwinds."" {{0|JPMorgan, meanwhile, downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform.
Meta’s disappointing quarterly results sent shockwaves across the social media stocks Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), both of which report after the closing bell, down about 23% and 9% respectively, while Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fell more than 5%.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which also reports results after the closing bell, was down more than 6%,  
The renewed selling in growth stocks like tech has cast doubt on whether the recent revival in growth has faded, but some suggest that further selling will subside as the broader market is nearing a bottom.
“I think we're in the seventh inning of a nine-inning game of the selloff in growth stocks … you've had a lot of damage done,” Chief Strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management Rhys Williams told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.
But it wasn’t all doom and gloom on the earnings front, with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) upbeat guidance and better-than-expected earnings that overshaded revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Its shares jumped 10%.
Cyclical stocks like energy and financials were in the red, but outperforming the broader market selloff, with latter supported by climb in bank stocks as 10-year yields flirted with 1.9%.
Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Invesco  (NYSE:IVZ) and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT) were more than 1% higher.
On the economic front, jobless claims fell more than expected last month ahead of the monthly nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The jobs on Friday, however, could prove somewhat of nothingburger as many are bracing for weaker data following the impact of the omicron.
“I don’t think  this nonfarm payroll report will have a major impact on markets as people aren’t expecting a great number,” Williams said. Economists are forecasting the economy added 150,000 jobs last month. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A plunge in the shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc fueled a surge of options trading on Thursday, with some investors positioning for a quick rebound in the company's stock.
With Meta shares down around 25%, over 1.4 million options contracts on the company had changed hands by 12:30 p.m. (1730 GMT).
That puts the options on track to finish the day with about 2.5 million contracts traded, compared with the previous record daily volume of 1.8 million contracts on Aug. 7, 2020, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
""It's pretty insane,"" said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe.
Meta shares plunged after the social media giant late on Wednesday issued a dismal forecast, blaming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes and increased competition.
Much of Thursday's options trading was in weekly options, with contracts set to expire on Friday making up about 40% of the trading volume, according to Trade Alert data.
Call options betting on Meta shares finishing above $250 by Friday were the most heavily traded Meta contracts on Thursday, with nearly 50,000 options traded.
""Volatility data shows an interest in upside bets,"" Schwartz said. 
Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts convey the right to sell the shares. 
Some traders were buying stocks and selling upside calls, Schwartz said. Such a strategy would allow them to collect a premium from the sale of the call while benefiting from a potential bounce in the stock.
The sharp drop in Meta shares likely hurts market makers - typically large banks or financial institutions - who may have sold Meta options straddles ahead of the results.
The straddle refers to an options strategy in which an investor holds a position in both a call and put option with the same strike price and expiration date. The price of the straddle serves as the market's expected move in the stock. 
""Market makers have to have taken a big loss on this one ... this has got to be painful,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS.
The huge move also appears to have taken options markets by surprise, accounting for some of the huge volume, analysts said.
Meta shares were expected to move only about 4.8%, based on the price of options straddles ahead of the results, Amberson said. 

The Meta share drop, far in excess of its straddle pricing, also goes counter to recent earnings-related stock price moves, where stocks have generally tended to move a lot less than options have implied, 
Over the last three weeks, the average actual earnings move logged by the stocks of companies that reported results was only about 85% of the average move expected by options prices, an ORATS analysis showed.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 02:13PM ET</span>","Merck sees 2022 sales up nearly 20%, mostly on molnupiravir","By Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Thursday it expects its 2022 sales to increase as much as 18 percent over last year, mostly on sales of its new COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir.
The drugmaker said sales of the COVID-19 drug were $952 million in the fourth quarter, and it expects another $5 to $6 billion of sales for the drug in 2022. Merck developed the pill - and shares the profits equally - with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.
Merck Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said in an interview it is possible the company could top those sales estimates for molnupiravir, which are based on already signed supply agreements for around 10 million courses of the drug. Merck still expects to produce an aggregate of 30 million treatment courses of molnupiravir by the end of the year, she said.
""Depending on how the pandemic plays out, could there be upside to this?"" Litchfield said. ""Yes, we've got the supply to provide more product to the markets.""
Enthusiasm for the antiviral pill, which was once touted as a potential game changer for treating COVID-19, has waned since it was shown to have about 30% efficacy in reducing hospitalizations in its clinical trial. A rival drug made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) had significantly better results in its trial, but supply of that pill is constrained in the near term.
Merck said it posted fourth-quarter earnings of $4.58 billion, or $1.80 a share, up from last year when it earned $2.49 billion, or 98 cents a share. Analysts, on average were expecting earnings of $1.53 a share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Sales were $13.52 billion in the quarter, up from $10.95 billion last year, driven by the molnupiravir sales and growth from cancer drug Keytruda and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil. Analysts had expected sales of around $13.2 billion in the quarter.
Merck said it expects 2022 earnings to be between $7.12 and $7.27 a share, just shy of analyst forecasts of $7.29 a share. It expects 2022 revenue to be between $56.1 billion and $57.6 billion, up from $48.7 billion last year.
CFO Litchfield says the company plans to reinvest much of the cash from what could be a one-year windfall from molnupiravir back in its business and to support business development.

""Our goal is to do meaningful business development. Should that not materialize, we would increase the level of share buybacks that we would do,"" she said.

Investing.com — Mp Materials Corp (NYSE:MP) shares fell to a three-month low Thursday following a short report from Bonitas Research, who said the company, ""executed an abusive transfer price manipulation scheme"" with Shenghe Resources Holding (SS:600392), a publicly-traded Chinese state-owned rare earth metals refiner and producer.
Shenghe holds an 8% stake in MP shares. Bonitas said Shenghe was previously a, ""100% customer who had rights to 100% of MP's production and 100% of MP's net income until Shenghe fully recouped its investment.""
""We believe that since 2Q'21, MP and Shenghe executed an abusive transfer price manipulation scheme whereby Shenghe overpaid for MP concentrates to artificially inflate MP's profits,"" Bonitas said in its report, adding that it coincided with the ""SPAC insider lock-up expiration so that MP Insiders could sell MP stock at artificially inflated prices.""
The investment research firm also pointed to a German academic economic study that concluded that MP's ore from the Mountain Pass mine in California is not economically viable to harvest for rare earth metals.
While they didn't disclose a price target, Bonitas said it is short MP.
Since the release, MP Materials has rejected the allegations in a series of tweets, saying they ""welcome @BonitasResearch to the long list of detractors that fail to understand our business, deceptively manipulate competing sets of data, and bet against $MP.""








Back in October, Grizzly Research also issued a short report on MP Materials, stating they believe Shenghe, ""can be traced back to the Chinese central government,"" and ""MP in reality remains under the control of the Chinese government."""

(Reuters) -Biogen Inc on Thursday forecast 2022 profit well below Wall Street estimates as sales of its new Alzheimer's disease drug stall, and said it was considering deals of all sizes.
The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) in January proposed https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/future-biogens-aduhelm-hinges-us-medicare-alzheimers-coverage-2022-01-11/#:~:text=Jan%2011%20(Reuters)%20-%20The,treatment%20more%20than%20many%20expected to severely restrict coverage for Alzheimer's drugs, including Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm, only to patients taking part in approved clinical trials. A final decision is expected in April.
Chief Financial Officer Michael McDonnell said the company was ""constantly looking at options around deals of all sizes,"" including drugs in early- and late-stage development, ""primarily focused on neuroscience.""
Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said investors will be looking for the company to make some business development moves.
""When your back is against the wall, as a company, your base business is in decline, and investors don't believe in the pipeline that you have, M&A becomes much more important,"" he said. ""How transformative of a deal should we or could we expect in 2022? That's the question.""
Biogen had already met with CMS to present its views on the regulator's proposal to limit patient access. Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said Biogen would advocate for a final decision that would provide coverage to the much larger group that was tested in the company's clinical trials. 
The company warned that it could be forced to cut more costs, beyond the current program to save $500 million annually, if the final coverage decision is not broader than the proposal. 
""We will take aggressive steps should the ... (coverage proposal) remain in its current form,"" Vounatsos said.
The decision on Aduhelm, once touted as a potential multibillion-dollar drug, comes at a pivotal time for the company, with sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera under pressure from generic competition.
Biogen on Thursday forecast full-year adjusted profit of $14.25 to $16.00 per share, well short of analysts' estimates of $18.82 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Aduhelm brought in $1 million in sales in the fourth quarter, compared to already diminished estimates of $2.8 million. 
Biogen's shares were off by about 1% at $222.36.

The deal is similar to one reached by the company in France earlier this week to axe a total of 2,600 jobs via voluntary departures over two years.
The group, which was formed one year ago through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, is seeking to reduce excess capacity in Europe and adapt production to an expected shift in demand towards electric vehicles (EVs).
Stellantis currently employs around 55,000 people in Italy.
Voluntary redundancies had been part of an agreement reached by unions and Stellantis last year but many had not happened, UILM said in a statement, resulting in a new agreement for this year. The union added that departing workers would benefit from company-provided incentive schemes and public subsidies.

Gianluca Ficco, UILM's top representative for the automotive sector, said Stellantis would allow workers, where possible, to move internally to make redundancies compatible with production needs.
A Stellantis spokesperson confirmed the information provided by UILM and said the company had no further comment.

(Reuters) - The family of Lee Creely, an inmate who died 17 months ago in Savannah, Georgia, filed a lawsuit against the jail’s county administrators and its health care provider this week, accusing the detention center and its medical staff of negligent care.
Creely, 34, was arrested on a probation violation on Sept. 3, 2020 for not reporting his change of address the previous month. Three nights later, Chatham County Detention Center staff found Creely dead, with his hands stiffened in rigor mortis, according to jails records reviewed by Reuters. 
Reuters had first reported on Creely and the Chatham County Detention Center as part of a 2020 investigation into mortality and health care at more than 500 jails nationwide over a decade. The Chatham County Detention Center counted at least 16 inmate deaths from 2014 to 2020.  
“This jail has been and continues to be a death factory. The security operation is run terribly and the for-profit medical providers that they have brought in consistently fail to deliver necessary care to people,” the Creely family’s attorney, William Claiborne, told Reuters. 
The lawsuit, which includes counts of wrongful death and denial of access to medical care, alleges that the jail’s medical provider, CorrectHealth LLC, did not provide medications or regularly monitor Creely, who was withdrawing from heroin and Xanax. CorrectHealth had prescribed Creely medications to manage his drug withdrawal, but only delivered those daily medications on his second day in custody, according to the family and jail records reviewed by Reuters. 
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the Georgia court system, also claims that the jail’s officers had not carried out regular checks on Creely’s cell. Shortly after Creely’s death, the sheriff’s department had fired five officers for allegedly failing to carry out security checks every 30 minutes in Creely’s jail wing. One officer was arrested for allegedly writing falsely in logbooks that he checked inmates’ cells 10 times over two and half days, but charges were later dropped.
Chatham County Sheriff John Wilcher declined to comment on the lawsuit. CorrectHealth and Chatham County’s Attorney R. Jonathan Hart did not respond to requests for comment.
An autopsy by Georgia Bureau of Investigation has listed fentanyl intoxication as the official cause of death. The sheriff’s internal affairs report on Creely’s death, reviewed by Reuters, said it believed the inmate had smuggled fentanyl inside the jail, hiding it in his anal cavity, despite a physical search and a body scan.

The sheriff’s report documented a series of lapses by officers. It said a guard had not alerted medical staff that Creely had vomited in his cell on his third day in jail. Just over 24 hours later, the same officer delivered a late afternoon meal to Creely that went untouched and then watched Creely breathing heavily and shaking on his bed. Soon after, the guard glanced inside the cell again and observed Creely’s feet shaking. The guard told investigators he knew he should have called medical staff but failed to do so. Neither did he did brief his fellow officers, the report said. At 10:22 p.m. that same evening, jail staff discovered Creely’s body. 
Reuters’ 2020 jail investigation, “Dying Inside”, found that nearly two-thirds of all inmates who died in the nation's largest jails never received their day in court on the charges for which they were held.

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - BT said it would merge its sports TV unit with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA)'s Eurosport in Britain and Ireland, enabling it to retain Premier League soccer for its customers while sharing the burden of expensive broadcast rights. 
BT, a former British telecoms monopoly, moved into sport in 2013 when it beat Rupert Murdoch's Sky to Champions League rights, hoping that exclusive content would help it stem broadband customer losses.
Some investors, however, have fretted about the volatile cost of sports rights, particularly when BT is spending billions on rolling out fibre broadband and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), DAZN and others have joined the fray.
The company said last year it was considering options for the unit, which is now profitable, including an outright sale.
BT Chief Executive Philip Jansen said BT saw no downside in the Discovery tie-up, and was very happy with the terms it had agreed on content. It wants to complete the deal in Q1. 
He said BT was committed to retaining its existing major sports rights including its crown jewel: Premier League soccer showing matches between Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United.
The 50:50 joint venture will also have rights to Eurosport's Olympic Games, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, as well as cycling, tennis, rugby and other sports, the companies said.
Sources last month had told Reuters that DAZN was near to buying BT Sport, and negotiations went down to the wire on Wednesday night. One source said the price jumped after Discovery made a last-minute offer, resulting in DAZN walking away. 
DAZN Chairman Kevin Mayer said the deal had ""become uneconomical"", but he remained committed to growing his business in Britain.
Jansen said there were two very good options on the table, but in the final analysis Discovery won out.
""From a corporate financial point of view, the profile much improves, because obviously there will be synergies, both in cost and revenue,"" he told reporters.
""And it keeps us very much in the competitive framework for what is a very interesting, exciting content market."" 
CONTENT LURE
JB Perrette, president and chief executive of Discovery Streaming and International, said the partnership was akin to the WarnerMedia deal the U.S. media company struck with another telecommunications giant, AT&T (NYSE:T). 
In the case of WarnerMedia, Discovery is acquiring that business for $43 billion, while it will contribute its assets to a joint venture.
""We understand the importance of content to our business,"" Perrette said in describing BT's interest in the joint venture.
""Can we do this in a way with someone who brings synergies to the table, brings operating expertise and a ton more content that we can bring to our customer base?,"" he said BT asked.
As well as an expanded sports portfolio, Discovery hopes the deal will attract subscribers to its entertainment offerings on Discovery+. 
Cut-throat competition between BT and Sky for the best soccer rights eased in 2017 when they agreed to carry each others channels.
BT said on Thursday it had agreed a new reciprocal deal stretching beyond 2030 with Sky, which is now owned by Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 
Shares in BT, which also lowered its revenue forecast for the year, closed down 5%.

Revenue fell 2% in the nine months to end-December to 15.68 billion pounds, with declines in global and enterprise partly offset by growth in the Openreach network. For the full-year it expects a 2% decline.
Jansen said, however, that cost savings meant it was keeping its adjusted earnings target of 7.5 billion to 7.7 billion pounds this financial year and more than 7.9 billion pounds next year unchanged.

(Reuters) - Retail investors appeared to be enthusiastically buying the dip in Wall Street's biggest growth companies on Thursday as the U.S. stock market plunged following Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc's disappointing quarterly report.
Investors on Fidelity's online trading platform placed four buy orders for every sell order, with the social media company topping the list of most-traded stocks.
Meta's stock slumped 25% after the social media heavyweight gave a dismal forecast late on Wednesday, blaming Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes and increased competition.
That plunge erased over $200 billion of Meta's stock market value, and also sparked drops in other growth stocks that have soared in recent years, with the Nasdaq down 2.6% at midday on Thursday.
It also unleashed a rush of trading in Meta's options, with some traders betting on a quick rebound in the stock, data from Trade Alert showed. Retail investors have accounted for a growing part of overall options trading volume in the past few years.
Fidelity showed its customers placing more than two Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) share purchase orders for every sell order as the online retailer's stock dropped nearly 7% ahead of its quarterly report after the bell.
As music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology dropped 16% after its disappointing report on Wednesday, Fidelity showed customers placing 2.5 buy orders for every sell order.
In several U.S. stock market selloffs in recent years, retail investors have reliably bought more of their favorite growth stocks, even as institutional investors shifted into less volatile companies with lower valuations.

When the S&P 500 dropped to its most recent closing low on Jan. 27 amid worries about rising interest rates, retail investors were net buyers, snapping up $1.4 billion worth of U.S. stocks, according to data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Track.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted to approve a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, particularly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
The measure, sponsored by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar along with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, would bar big app stores from requiring providers to use their payment system.
Blumenthal noted the 30% cut that Google and Apple take for many app and in-app purchases and subscriptions, saying it was a sign of ""monopolistic power"" and raises prices for consumers.
Blackburn accused Silicon Valley executives of ""arrogance"" and refusing to engage with Congress. 
""I don't want to say or have people think that I'm saying that big tech is bad, because big is not bad. But it is clear that guardrails are now needed,"" added Blackburn. 
Apple said in a letter sent to key lawmakers that the measure favored ""side-loading,"" or loading apps on to Apple devices without using the company's App Store, which would allow those app companies to avoid what the letter called Apple's ""pro-consumer privacy protections.""
Google has already lowered the commission it charges apps for using its payment system even though it will reduce its revenue.
""We've made our concerns to Congress clear. This bill could destroy many consumer benefits that current payment systems provide and distort competition by exempting gaming platforms, which amounts to Congress trying to artificially pick winners and losers in a highly competitive marketplace,"" said Mark Isakowitz, a Google vice president for public policy.

The stakes are high for Apple, whose App Store anchors its $68.4 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.
The biggest technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), have been under pressure in Congress because of allegations they abused their outsized market power.

The Biden administration laid out plans last month that require private insurance companies to cover the cost of eight over-the-counter at-home tests per person each month, but said nothing about such coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.
Under the new coverage plan announced on Thursday, Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will be able to access up to eight over-the-counter COVID-19 tests per month for free.
The latest announcement is a ""positive"" for those enrolled in Medicare plans, with the federal government covering costs directly, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said.
""The program is also a potential small positive for pharmacies to sell the tests to Medicare beneficiaries, though supply is limited and the window may be short depending when the public health emergency ends.""
At least nine over-the-counter rapid antigen tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration including  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT)' BinaxNOW, OraSure Technologies Inc's InteliSwab and ACON Laboratories' FlowFlex.

Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp are some of the others who make these tests.
Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare payment coverage for people aged 65 and older, and younger people with permanent kidney failure.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc on Thursday reported quarterly profits that beat forecasts, as market volatility and rising interest rate expectations boosted demand for the company's hedging products, offsetting a slowdown in its mortgage unit. 
The New York Stock Exchange-owner's net income nearly tripled to $1.5 billion, or $2.70 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter, which included a $1.4 billion gain from the spin-off of digital asset exchange Bakkt https://www.reuters.com/article/bakkt-spac-vpc-impact-acqsn-idUSL4N2JM2HS, from $526 million, or 93 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, ICE, which runs futures and equities exchanges, as well as clearing houses, data services and a mortgage origination business, earned $1.34 per share, topping analysts' mean estimate by 2 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The primary driver of the earnings beat came from ICE's exchange segment, with a big jump in interest rate futures, which are used for hedging against rate increases, Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon said in a note.
Consumer prices rose 7% last year, more than twice the Federal Reserve's 2% goal and U.S. central bank policymakers have signaled they will start raising interest rates next month, perhaps at a pace not seen in decades, prompting a rise in market volatility.
""We have a lot of asset classes that we participate in ... that will benefit from that volatility, and we tend to see commodity businesses like energy and agricultural commodities be very volatile in inflationary environments,"" ICE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher said on a call with analysts. 
Exchanges revenue rose 17% from a year earlier to $1 billion, with interest rate futures up 71%, global natural gas and environmentals up 36%, and cash equities and options up 2%. 
Mortgage technology revenues eased 1% from to $346 million, while data services revenues rose 7% to $480 million.
Overall revenue rose 10% to $1.8 billion.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co deferred its timeline to complete application for accelerated approval of its experimental Alzheimer's drug, saying it expects such an approval to make little difference with Medicare's limited coverage terms. 
Shares of Eli Lilly fell 2.6% to $244.21 on Thursday, after the drugmaker said it would complete the application sometime later in 2022, pushing away from first quarter, its initial timeline. 
The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services has restricted coverage for Alzheimer's drugs, including Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s controversial treatment Aduhelm, only to patients taking part in approved clinical trials. 
The agency's final coverage terms, due in April, are expected to apply to all drugs in the class, including Lilly's donanemab as well as those being developed by Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd.
""We're trying to take investor focus off the exact timing of accelerated approval, given our very limited expectations for the impact of that accelerated approval commercially,"" said Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky.
Skovronsky said the company expects data from the confirmatory trial of donanemab by mid-2023, after which it may have more clarity on reimbursements under Medicare.
""I think people are now expecting that there will probably be no sales for donanemab this year, and essentially zero sales next year,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Diwan said.
Lilly said a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision on using its arthritis drug, Olumiant, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is expected by the middle of this year.

The drug is currently authorized in the United States for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients and saw a 59% jump in sales in the fourth quarter.
Lilly beat estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit, buoyed by strong demand for its top-selling diabetes drug Trulicity as well as higher sales of its COVID-19 antibody therapies.

Investing.com – Biogen stock (NASDAQ:BIIB) traded 2% lower Thursday after the company projected its annual revenue to fall further after declining in 2021, a disappointing development after much was expected from its Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm.
Biogen expects full year 2022 revenue to fall to between $9.7 billion and $10 billion, another hit after 2021 sales eroded 18% to just shy of $11 billion.
The financial guidance assumes minimal Aduhelm revenue in 2022 after the drug clocked in a mere $3 million in around five months of its presence in the market. The company also expects entry of certain generics in the U.S. to hit its sales. Broader competition will weigh too.
Aduhelm has been surrounded in controversy since June 7 when the Food and Drug Administration approved it. It was the first drug in 18 years to secure the nod for treatment of the neurodegenerative disease.
The approval attracted much criticism because of perceived lack of benefits of the treatment over existing alternatives. The controversy was further stoked by the expensive annual $56,000 tag of the treatment. The price was seen as a significant burden on Medicare, which covers more than 60 million people. Six months later, Biogen almost halved the price.  
Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services proposed to restrict coverage for Alzheimer's drugs, including Aduhelm, only to patients taking part in approved clinical trials. A final decision is expected in April.
The company has warned it could be forced to cut more costs, beyond the current program to save $500 million annually, if the final coverage decision is not broader.
""We will take aggressive steps should the ... (coverage proposal) remain in its current form,"" Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos as saying.
Fourth quarter total revenue fell 4% to $2.7 billion. Adjusted net profit per share was $3.39 and beat estimates. Biogen expects adjusted EPS for the year to be $14.25-$16.00 per share.

LONDON (Reuters) -KPMG has been sued for 1.3 billion pounds ($1.77 billion) by the liquidators of Carillion for missing ""red flags"" during audits of the construction giant, in one of the largest claims against one of the world's top accountants.
Britain's Official Receiver, part of the Insolvency Service, which is liquidating the former blue-chip group, alleged that negligent failures by KPMG to detect misstatements in the accounts of Carillion - which collapsed in 2018 under 7 billion pounds of debt - cost claimants ""extensive loss and damage"".
KPMG said it believed the lawsuit, details of which were made public on Thursday, was without merit and vowed to defend the case robustly.
""Responsibility for the failure of Carillion lies solely with the company's board and management, who set the strategy and ran the business,"" a KPMG representative said.
The claim, filed on behalf of creditors, turns on allegations that Carillion amassed vast trading losses, paid out about 210 million pounds in dividends between 2014 and 2016 and almost 39 million pounds in professional fees in 2017, because it relied on KPMG's audits.
The liquidator alleged KPMG failed to remain independent from its client and failed to exercise proper professional scepticism. One audit engagement partner repeatedly accepted hospitality from and offered hospitality to senior Carillion management, the lawsuit alleged.
The failure of Carillion, whose projects included schools, hospitals, prisons and part of a high-speed rail link, plunged thousands of jobs into uncertainty, threatened major public sector works and raised fresh questions about the risks of handing public sector projects to private companies.
The Insolvency Service has applied for eight directors linked to Carillion to be disqualified and the Financial Conduct Authority, the market regulator, has proposed handing Carillion a public censure over ""reckless"" behaviour.
But high-profile corporate failures in Britain have also sparked investigations and government-backed reviews to boost accounting standards in a market dominated by KPMG and its peers EY, Deloitte and PwC, known as the Big Four, who audit all of Britain's 100 top blue-chip companies.
Auditors have been lambasted after a string of corporate failures over two decades, from Arthur Andersen's oversight of failed U.S. energy giant Enron in 2001 to EY's audits of payment services group Wirecard, which collapsed in 2020.
Some accountancy experts note that PwC is a special advisor to the UK Official Receiver and stands to profit from the case against KPMG - and that headline-grabbing damages claims can settle out of court for a fraction of their original size.

Jan du Plessis, the chair designate of Britain's FRC - an agency long criticised for failing to crack down on poor auditing after corporate collapses such as Carillion, retailer BHS and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie - said last month it was time to ""jack up"" scrutiny.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A flaw in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s software exploited by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group to break into iPhones in 2021 was simultaneously abused by a competing company, according to five people familiar with the matter.
QuaDream, the sources said, is a smaller and lower profile Israeli firm that also develops smartphone hacking tools intended for government clients. 
The two rival businesses gained the same ability last year to remotely break into iPhones, according to the five sources, meaning that both firms could compromise Apple phones without an owner needing to open a malicious link. That two firms employed the same sophisticated hacking technique – known as a “zero-click” – shows that phones are more vulnerable to powerful digital spying tools than the industry will admit, one expert said.
""People want to believe they're secure, and phone companies want you to believe they're secure. What we've learned is, they're not,"" said Dave Aitel, a partner at Cordyceps Systems, a cybersecurity firm.  
Experts analyzing intrusions engineered by NSO Group and QuaDream since last year believe the two companies used very similar software exploits, known as ForcedEntry, to hijack iPhones. 
An exploit is computer code designed to leverage a set of specific software vulnerabilities, giving a hacker unauthorized access to data.
The analysts believed NSO and QuaDream's exploits were similar because they leveraged many of the same vulnerabilities hidden deep inside Apple's instant messaging platform and used a comparable approach to plant malicious software on targeted devices, according to three of the sources.
Bill Marczak, a security researcher with digital watchdog Citizen Lab who has been studying both companies' hacking tools, told Reuters that QuaDream's zero-click capability seemed ""on par"" with NSO's.
Reuters made repeated attempts to reach QuaDream for comment, sending messages to executives and business partners. A Reuters journalist last week visited QuaDream’s office, in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, but no one answered the door. Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, also did not return repeated messages.
  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on QuaDream or say what if any action they planned to take with regard to the company.
ForcedEntry is viewed as ""one of the most technically sophisticated exploits"" ever captured by security researchers. 
So similar were the two versions of ForcedEntry that when Apple fixed the underlying flaws in September 2021 it rendered both NSO and QuaDream’s spy software ineffective, according to two people familiar with the matter.
In a written statement, an NSO spokeswoman said the company ""did not cooperate"" with QuaDream but that ""the cyber intelligence industry continues to grow rapidly globally."" 
Apple sued NSO Group over ForcedEntry in November, claiming that NSO had violated Apple's user terms and services agreement. The case is still in its early stages. 
In its lawsuit, Apple said that it ""continuously and successfully fends off a variety of hacking attempts."" NSO has denied any wrongdoing. 
Spyware companies have long argued they sell high-powered technology to help governments thwart national security threats. But human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly documented the use of spyware to attack civil society, undermine political opposition, and interfere with elections. 
Apple notified thousands of ForcedEntry targets in November, making elected officials, journalists, and human rights workers around the world realize they had been placed under surveillance. 
In Uganda, for example, NSO's ForcedEntry was used to spy on U.S. diplomats, Reuters reported . 
In addition to the Apple lawsuit, Meta's WhatsApp is also litigating over the alleged abuse of its platform. In November, NSO was put on a trade blacklist by the U.S. Commerce Department over human rights concerns. 
Unlike NSO, QuaDream has kept a lower profile despite serving some of the same government clients. The company has no website touting its business and employees have been told to keep any reference to their employer off social media, according to a person familiar with the company.
REIGN 
QuaDream was founded in 2016 by Ilan Dabelstein, a former Israeli military official, and by two former NSO employees, Guy Geva and Nimrod Reznik, according to Israeli corporate records and two people familiar with the business. Reuters could not reach the three executives for comment.
Like NSO's Pegasus spyware, QuaDream's flagship product - called REIGN - could take control of a smartphone, scooping up instant messages from services such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, as well as emails, photos, texts and contacts, according to two product brochures from 2019 and 2020 which were reviewed by Reuters. 
REIGN's “Premium Collection” capabilities included the ""real time call recordings"", ""camera activation - front and back"" and ""microphone activation"", one brochure said.
Prices appeared to vary. One QuaDream system, which would have given customers the ability to launch 50 smartphone break-ins per year, was being offered for $2.2 million exclusive of maintenance costs, according to the 2019 brochure. Two people familiar with the software's sales said the price for REIGN was typically higher.
Over the years, QuaDream and NSO Group employed some of the same engineering talent, according to three people familiar with the matter. Two of those sources said the companies did not collaborate on their iPhone hacks, coming up with their own ways to take advantage of vulnerabilities.
Several of QuaDream's buyers have also overlapped with NSO's, four of the sources said, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico - both of whom have been accused of misusing spy software to target political opponents. 

One of QuaDream's first clients was the Singaporean government, two of the sources said, and documentation reviewed by Reuters shows the company's surveillance technology was pitched to the Indonesian government as well. Reuters couldn't determine if Indonesia became a client. 
Mexican, Singaporean, Indonesian and Saudi officials did not return messages seeking comment about QuaDream.

Investing.com — Shares of industrial company Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) fell more than 6% Thursday after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings that missed revenue expectations and offered weak guidance.
Honeywell reported an EPS of $2.09 on revenue of $8.66 billion. Analysts forecast an EPS of $2.08 on revenue of $8.73 billion. 
The company told investors it was ""an extremely challenging operating environment"" during the period due to supply-related constraints within its aerospace division and mask demand waning. Their Safety and Productivity Solutions division, which makes the masks, experienced a 10% decline in sales in Q4. The company expects a further decline in mask demand this year.
While the revenue miss had an impact, Honeywell's guidance added more fuel to its share price fall, with the company expecting sales in 2022 of $35.4 billion to $36.4 billion, below the $36.76 billion consensus. Meanwhile, it forecast an earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.70, again below the consensus $8.97.
“Honeywell had a strong finish to another challenging year,"" stated Darius Adamczyk, chairman and CEO of Honeywell.
""Our disciplined cost management, swift pricing actions to stay ahead of the inflation curve, and improved productivity resulted in 60 basis points of segment margin expansion for the year. As a result, our full-year adjusted earnings per share increased by 14% year over year. We also were strong cash generators in 2021, delivering $6.0 billion in operating cash flow with 109% conversion and $5.7 billion of free cash flow with 102% adjusted conversion and free cash flow margin of 17%.”
Shares traded at around $196/share in mid-day action, with the company setting a new 52-week low share price earlier in the day.

(Reuters) -Estee Lauder Cos Inc raised its annual revenue and profit projections on Thursday as price hikes and a recovery in demand for its makeup products blunt the hit from surging costs. 
Sales of the cosmetics maker rose in every region in the last three months of 2021 and demand for most of its products grew from pre-pandemic levels, powering the company's second-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations. 
Makeup sales jumped 11%, continuing their recovery as consumers venturing out more to gatherings after the easing of curbs splurged on Estee's foundations and MAC lipsticks.
The company also benefited from the reopening of brick-and-mortar stores and a return to office in the United States and the United Kingdom, which led sales growth among its Western markets. 
The La Mer maker expects reported net sales to rise between 13% and 16% for the full year, compared with its previous forecast of a 12% to 15% increase. 
Still, it continues to face pressure from higher costs wrought by industry-wide supply chain problems and raw material inflation. Its margins were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at 77.9%.
""Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter ... however, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts"" Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said.
The company forecast current-quarter adjusted profit between $1.55 and $1.65 per share, below expectations of $1.92, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said higher prices and solid demand should help the company, but cautioned the ""positive factors might not entirely offset higher costs in the shorter term.""
Estee shares were down about 3% in a weaker overall market, after rising about 39% last year.

The overall weakness in tech stocks, led by the 24% drop in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), also put pressure on the stock. The Nasdaq Composite NASDAQ Composite was down 1.8% after Meta recorded the first fall in its user base in December quarter its 18-year history.
In the so-called RF front-end market -- chips that help convert radio signals into data and voice -- revenue was 7% higher at $1.1 billion, short of $1.3 billion estimates, according to Bloomberg. Sales of automotive chips were 21% higher at $256 million, compared with an estimate of $277 million.
The company prioritized sales to manufacturers in China as it tried to capture a larger share of the market for smartphone chips, an opportunity arising out of Huawei’s exit.

(Reuters) -Investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd said on Thursday it expects dealmaking activity to remain robust following a record-breaking year for mergers and acquisitions, after posting earnings well above expectations.
Global mergers and acquisitions topped $5 trillion for the first time in 2021, buoyed by an abundance of cheap capital and sky-high valuations, boosting earnings at Wall Street investment banks and resulting in multi-million dollar paydays for top rainmakers.
That also resulted in Lazard reporting record fourth-quarter and full-year profits.
M&A activity continues to be strong in 2022 despite macroeconomic concerns around inflation that is forcing central banks worldwide to turn more hawkish, which could make dealmaking more expensive, Lazard's top management said on a call with analysts.
Lazard, one of the top 10 M&A advisors in the world, said it plans to hire more investment bankers this year as it looks to advise on more high-profile deals.
""While volatility may remain elevated, we are encouraged by early signs of market rotation from speculative growth to quality and value,"" Chief Financial Officer Evan Russo said.
Lazard reported a 14% surge in operating revenue to $968 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue from its financial advisory unit jumped 20% to $608 million, while its asset management arm revenue rose 3% to $347 million. 

The U.S. bank's adjusted net income rose to $217 million, or $1.92 per share from $192 million, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of $1.44 per share, according to Refinitiv-IBES. 
Shares in Lazard were down 2% in early trading, in sympathy with weaker sentiment in U.S. markets. [.N]

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Cloud services providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other data processing service providers must set up safeguards against illegal data transfers to non-EU governments, according to the European Commission's Data Act to be published this month.
The proposed rule, seen by Reuters, sets out rights and obligations on the use of EU data such as smart machinery and consumer goods, and is part of a raft of legislations aimed at reining in U.S. tech giants and helping the bloc meet its green and digital objectives.
EU concerns about data transfers have been growing ever since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance.
Europe's top court in 2020 scrapped a transatlantic data transfer deal known as the Privacy Shield and relied on by thousands of companies for services ranging from cloud infrastructure to payroll and finance because of similar concerns. 
The United States and the EU have been trying to come up with a new pact in the two years since then. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she was confident there would be a new accord which takes into account the EU court's concerns.
""The Biden administraion considers finalising an enhanced Privacy Shield the No. 1 priority,"" she told an event organised by trade body DIGITALEUROPE.
""We remain optimistic that we can reach a durable arrangement that fully addresses the European Court of Justice ruling in Schrems II that can withstand legal challenges and is based on our shared democratic values.""
The Data Act goes further than current curbs on the transfer of personal data outside the 27-country bloc by extending such restrictions to non-personal data.
""Concerns around unlawful access by non-EU/EEA governments have been raised. Such safeguards should further enhance trust in the data processing services that increasingly underpin the European data economy,"" the EU document said.
It said that providers of data processing services will have ""to take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures to prevent such access that could potentially conflict with competing obligations to protect such data under EU law, unless strict conditions are met"".
The Data Act seeks to develop interoperability standards for data to be used between sectors following concerns of barriers to data sharing within and between industries.

It also aims to make it easier for companies to switch between cloud and edge services by setting out minimum regulatory contractual, commercial and technical requirements on providers of cloud, edge and other data processing services to enable switching between such services.
The Commission has set a tentative date of Feb. 23 for publishing the Data Act.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) again boosted its dividend and share repurchases on Thursday after fourth quarter profits hit their highest in eight years, fuelled by higher oil and gas prices and strong gas trading performance. 
The strong results cap a dramatic recovery in 2021 for Shell and the oil and gas sector after energy demand and prices collapsed in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell shares were up 0.7% by 1448 GMT, compared with a 0.5% decline for the broader European energy index.
Shell, which moved its headquarters from The Hague to London last month, said it expected to lift its dividend by 4% in the first quarter of 2022 to $0.25 per share, which would be the fourth rise since Shell cut its dividend in early 2020 for the first time since the 1940s. 
The company also said it would buy back $8.5 billion worth of shares in the first half of 2022, including $5.5 billion from the sale of its Permian shale assets in the United States. That compares with share buybacks totalling $3.5 billion in 2021.
""2021 was a momentous year for Shell,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
Shell's results came on the day British regulators hiked energy prices by 54% in response to higher power prices, prompting calls to levy a tax on oil and gas producers.
Natural gas and electricity prices around the world have soared since the middle of last year on tight gas supplies and higher demand as economies rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Benchmark European gas prices and Asian LNG prices hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter.
Shell, the largest trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG), said its integrated gas earnings were boosted by ""significantly higher"" profits from trading. 
Trading helped offset an 11% fall in LNG sales and a 7% drop in LNG production in 2021 as a result of plant maintenance and unplanned outages, including at its flagship Prelude floating LNG plant in Australia. 
Prelude would stay shut for the first three months of 2022, van Beurden told reporters, adding that Shell would help supply Europe with gas in case of Russian disruptions.

U.S. rival  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday reported its largest profit in seven years, while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX)'s profit missed estimates.
BP (NYSE:BP) , TotalEnergies and Equinor report results next week. 
Shell officially ditched ""Royal Dutch"" from its name this month and merged its dually-listed shares after moving its head office from The Hague to London as part of a tax and structure simplification drive, which van Beurden said would help the company plan to grow its low-carbon business.
Fourth-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings rose by 55% from the previous quarter to $6.4 billion, well above an average analyst forecast provided by the company for a $5.2 billion profit. It earned $393 million a year earlier.
For the year, Shell's adjusted earnings rose to $19.3 billion, compared with $4.85 billion in 2020.
""Net income came in 22% ahead of consensus expectations and net debt fell sharply. On top, Shell announced an $8.5 billion share buyback programme for (the first half), also ahead of market expectations,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Martijn Rats said.
The energy company said it planned this year's spending at the lower end of the $23 billion-$27 billion after spending $20 billion in 2021.
Net debt dropped in the year to $52.55 billion from $75.4 billion at the end of 2020. Shell's debt-to-capital ratio, or gearing, dropped to 23.1% from 32.2% over the same period.
Shell's cash generation soared by a third to $45 billion in 2021 as global economic activity recovered from the pandemic.

Shares of Snap fell more than 19.4%. However, they aren't the only company to feel the ripple effect of Meta's earnings, with other social media stocks such as  Pinterest Inc  (NYSE:PINS) taking a tumble.
Snap's shares were further weighed down after Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson lowered the price target on Snap to $36 from $85. However, he kept an Overweight rating.
In a note, quoted by TheFly, Patterson said he sees headwinds, including ad measurement driving shifts away from social, vertical headwinds, and margin pressure from investment. 
The analyst also cautions that the extent of margin risk could be a new sentiment overhang but believes valuation multiples have swung significantly, which will leave room for the company's earnings results to be ""less bad.""

Analysts say the auto sector in Italy could be hit harder than elsewhere because of the small average size of firms in the country and the scale of investment needed to comply with the European Union's ""Fit-For-55"" climate plan phasing out combustion engines by 2035.
""This plan, if not accompanied by (government) intervention, could lead to a loss of approximately 73,000 jobs in Italy, with 63,000 in the 2025-2030 period,"" employers' group Federmeccanica and the FIM, FIOM and UILM unions said in a rare joint statement.
They said vehicle production in Italy fell from over 1.8 million units in 1997 to 700,000 last year, including fewer than 500,000 cars.
""We need to go back to producing some 1.5 million units a year,"" FIOM's head Francesca Re David said.
The automotive industry in Italy employs 278,000 workers directly and indirectly and accounts for around 6% of the country's gross domestic product, according to data from automotive association ANFIA.
Earlier this week, Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said he would present proposals in the coming weeks for incentives to support the Italian automotive industry.

Unions are also urging the government to strike a final agreement with Stellantis, the largest carmaker in the country, to build a battery making plant to supply the production of electrified vehicles in Italy.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said last year the group would build one of its European battery plants in Termoli, in central Italy, but a deal with Rome has not been signed yet.

988,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 09:44AM ET</span>",Meta Meltdown Drags Wall Street Lower at Open; Dow Down 220 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell sharply at the opening on Thursday, pulled down by a slump in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock after its disappointing earnings update on Wednesday.
The Facebook owner opened down 26%, reversing all its gains of the last 20 months, after the company reported its first-ever quarterly decline in active users and forecast a squeeze on profits this year from heavy investment plans and from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy policy changes that came into effect last year. Absent a recovery, that will be the biggest one-day loss in market capitalization for any company ever.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.9%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, less exposed to longer-duration growth stocks such as Meta, fell only 218 points, or 0.6%, to 35,412. 
The main indices had enjoyed a four-day winning streak prior to Thursday.
Meta's report revived familiar fears about the stretched valuations of many technology stocks, illustrating that the kind of collapse that has become commonplace in 'profitless tech' is also possible even in stocks that have consistently thrown out cash in recent years. Meta's slump comes only a week after streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) issued a similar shock warning, and only a day after PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) fell by over 20% in response to a profit warning of its own. PayPal stock shed another 3.8% in early trading on Thursday. 
Almost inevitably, Meta's results had their most direct impact on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock. The Snapchat parent has faced similar issues of slowing growth and is still unprofitable. Its stock had fallen over 20% in response to its previous quarter's results, and it fell another 20% on Thursday. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock also fell 18% to a 21-month low after warning of a coming slowdown in user growth.
Snap reports after the close, along with Amazon. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, which peaked in November, fell another 6.2% as investors adjusted for the risk of a similar disappointment. Analysts have fretted that rising labor costs and the reopening of the retail sector may pressure the fourth quarter's earnings for the e-commerce giant. However, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it has a highly profitable Cloud-hosting division to prop up earnings. 
On a more positive note, data released earlier suggested that the labor market was on track to put behind it the soft patch caused by the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 in January. Initial jobless claims fell by more than expected to 238,000, their lowest in three weeks, while unit labor costs rose by much less than expected in the fourth quarter, alleviating fears of entrenched inflation. ULCs across the economy rose only 0.3% from the third quarter, rather than the 1.2% rise expected.  There was also a slight drop in the prices paid component of the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index, suggesting that inflationary pressures may be close to peaking. 
Also defying the gloom was T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock, after the cellular carrier reported a buoyant fourth quarter and upgraded its estimate for savings from its merger with Sprint. T-Mobile rose as much as 10% before retracting to be up 8.8%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When U.S. President Joe Biden accused Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of ""killing people"" by spreading vaccine lies in July, many experts and researchers hoped it marked the beginning of a White House battle against a flood of misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic coursing through the United States. 
Six months later, the deluge of misinformation continues and entities combating harmful information want the White House to do more. COVID-19 deaths recently hit their highest in almost a year, with over 2,600 people dying on average each day. U.S. studies show the unvaccinated are dying at much higher rates than those with jabs and boosters. 
""The problem of vaccine misinformation was big a year ago and it is still big now,"" said David Lazer, who co-leads the Covid States Project. Fighting misinformation ""requires continued focus and attention and effort,"" he said. 
After slamming Facebook on July 16, Biden never again publicly accused Facebook or another company by name of spreading misinformation, according to a Reuters analysis of the president's speeches and remarks since that day. Biden has delivered 24 speeches on COVID specifically, including townhalls, since he called out Facebook, the analysis shows. 
Interviews with 11 White House sources, experts and researchers who have worked with the Biden administration on this topic show that top White House aides feel Biden has few legal options to force social media platforms to comply and the administration has not been able to settle on a strategy to rein in Silicon Valley. Several pieces of legislation to hold social media companies responsible have stalled. 
Biden also did not issue an executive order or proclamation to combat misinformation as he has done nearly three dozen times on other pandemic issues, according to a Reuters tally of White House records. 
A dozen misinformation superspreaders identified by the White House and the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) last year, still hold over 40 accounts on Meta Platforms Inc-owned Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and other social media companies, with millions of followers, as of December. 
The White House ""has been in regular touch with social media platforms, as well as leaders and media outlets about the critical importance of ensuring that they do not peddle misinformation,"" a White House official said. These meetings, the official said, include discussing the work such entities are doing to combat harmful information, and holding them accountable. 
A majority of healthcare workers, in a January survey conducted by the COVID States Project, a U.S. research group trying to understand why so many Americans do not want to get vaccinated, said vaccine misinformation is ""the single most important factor influencing unvaccinated patients decision not to get the COVID-19 vaccine.""
Social media - particularly Facebook - remains one of the most commonly cited sources of misinformation negatively impacting patients, the healthcare workers in the survey said. 
A Meta spokesperson declined to comment but the company previously said it had removed more than 24 million pieces of COVID-19 content globally and displayed warnings on more than 195 million pieces of COVID-related content on Facebook for violating its policies. 
A YouTube spokesperson said the company has terminated the channels of several well-known spreaders of vaccine misinformation and since October 2020, it had removed over 130,000 videos for COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. 
THE SECTION 230 PROBLEM
Biden has no easy legal options because Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields social media companies from being liable for what users post on their platforms, according to White House sources, experts and researchers who have worked with the White House on this topic. 
""The administration...is in fact far too cozy with tech companies, there is of course an institutional resistance at the civil servant level,"" said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who engaged with the White House last year on the issue. ""It poses a serious problem when you're seeking to legislate and go into combat against companies.""
Tech companies were some of the top donors to Biden's election campaign and now former Silicon Valley insiders serve in key positions in the administration. 
Two White House sources, who worked on the issue last year, said the reason Biden backed off was due to few legal options and disagreement inside the White House over how tough to be on tech companies. 
""The most that can be done is urging the companies to take action and we did a lot of that last year,"" one of the sources said. 
Top officials at the White House held a series of combative meetings with social media companies, and Facebook in particular, leading up to last July to get the company and others to act on vaccine misinformation. Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, among others, also criticized the platforms publicly.
The growing pressure culminated with Biden's off-the-cuff comments on July 16. Since then, Biden has refrained from blaming social media companies directly by name.
Biden addressed harmful information on social media platforms four times since July 16. Twice he walked back his comments on Facebook: he said ""Facebook isn't killing people"" on July 19 and added ""I wasn't attacking Facebook"" on July 22.
He also mentioned the word ""misinformation"" in the context of it being a problem, without mentioning the role specific social media companies play, six times since July 16. 
A Surgeon General's advisory about health misinformation in the United States, issued after Biden's July remark, focuses on how communities can combat it, not the companies spreading it. The recent controversy involving Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s role in spreading COVID misinformation, drew boilerplate criticism from the White House, saying the companies should do more to stop such content. 

Hany Farid, a computer science professor and misinformation researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, urged the White House's domestic policy team last year to do more to tackle misinformation.
Farid said he has not seen a ""coherent or consistent message"" from the White House and wants to see more leadership on the topic publicly. ""I have not seen a message from the White House... to Congress to get serious about this.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Leaving critical insurance capital rule changes to 'conservative' regulators may not free up the billions of euros needed for the European Union economy to recover from COVID-19 and meet climate goals, a senior EU lawmaker said on Thursday.
The EU has proposed a package of changes to the bloc's six-year old Solvency II rules, which determine how much capital insurers like AXA, Generali (MI:GASI) and Allianz (DE:ALVG) must hold, to make it easier to invest in long-term projects.
The proposals need approval from the European Parliament and member states to come into effect, with compromises inevitable.
Markus Ferber, the German centre right lawmaker who is steering the reform through parliament, said the bloc's executive European Commission, which drafted the reforms, has said some changes should be left to the bloc's insurance regulator EIOPA.
""This is not an acceptable approach,"" Ferber told an event held by Insurance Europe.
Little tweaks in numbers can free up billions of euros or tie up billions of euros, he said.
""Finding the right trade-off on those numbers is a political decision. EIOPA will ultimately always go for a very conservative and very cautious calibration,"" Ferber said, adding he will push for legislators to have a bigger role in making the trade-offs.
With London becoming a major competitor to EU finance since Brexit, the bloc wants to be more nimble in regulation by avoiding putting technical details in primary legislation, which is cumbersome to amend.
John Berrigan, who heads the Commission's financial services unit, said Solvency II was primarily about keeping insurers safe and the reform package has the right balance between this and helping to increase the flow of investments.
The package is an evolution rather than revolution and the Commission will maintain its balance between primary legislation and rulemaking by regulators, Berrigan said.
The Commission is asking EIOPA to assess whether insurers could hold less capital to cover risks from ""green"" projects compared with polluting ""brown"" projects, Berrigan said.

""The objective will never to be to give a free pass to risky but green projects,"" Berrigan said.
Britain is also overhauling the Solvency II regime it inherited from the bloc, but has yet to set out what specific changes it has in mind.

The report https://www.reuters.com/business/rio-tinto-report-finds-disturbing-culture-sexual-harassment-racism-bullying-2022-02-01, which sparked calls from investors for the entire industry to clean up its act, found that male and female Rio Tinto employees in South Africa experienced the highest rates of racism, at 34.5% and 33.8% respectively, compared to workers in other countries.
Workers at Rio Tinto in South Africa were also the most likely to experience bullying, the report released on Tuesday found, with 54.1% of men and 61.6% of women reporting having been bullied at work.
""We can only encourage those affected to use the protection of our constitution and EEA (Employment Equity Act) to report cases of discrimination to the CCMA (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration) including cases of bullying,"" the labour ministry said in written responses to Reuters' questions.
A Rio Tinto spokesperson said the company is talking to its people across the world and ""encouraging them to raise any concerns with a trusted colleague, leader or through our confidential reporting programme.""
The spokesperson reiterated CEO Jakob Stausholm's comments on Tuesday that he has committed to make Rio Tinto ""safe, respectful and inclusive"" and that the company would implement all 26 recommendations from the report.
Rio Tinto's South African subsidiary Richards Bay Minerals extracts and refines heavy mineral sands and produces ilmenite, rutile, and zircon at its site in northern KwaZulu-Natal province.
No-one at Richards Bay Minerals was immediately available to comment.
Asked how prevalent racism, sexism, and bullying are in South Africa's mining industry overall, the ministry said ""we are sure that there are many instances of discrimination and bullying in the labour market in general"". 
However, affected individuals are reluctant to report these cases, the ministry said.

""We must say that it is also encouraging that it is the company that has initiated this research,"" the labour ministry added, referring to Rio Tinto's report. ""What is left is them taking proper action to deal with the findings.""
Asked about the report, South Africa's mining industry body the Minerals Council said it and its members ""reaffirm their stance of zero tolerance for racism, sexism and gender-based violence in the mining industry"".

Investing.com – ConocoPhillips stock (NYSE:COP) traded 0.4% lower Thursday after the company’s move to top up its shareholder returns by $1 billion fell short of expectations.
The company now plans to give back $8 billion to shareholders in 2022 through various instruments including repurchases and dividends. This compares with  Exxon Mobil  's (NYSE:XOM) ongoing $10 billion share repurchase program and Shell's (NYSE:SHEL) plan to buy back shares worth $8.5 billion within the first half of 2022.
Shell also plans to increase its dividend by 4% in the current quarter to 25 cents per share.
Tensions in the Middle East and between U.S and Russia, reluctance of the OPEC+ to raise output and pandemic-fueled boom in economies have all contributed to push energy prices to record highs. Those prices have boosted cash flows at energy majors and enabled them to return more cash to shareholders, moves investors have welcomed given the world’s mood has mostly turned against firms dependent on fossil fuels.
ConocoPhillips’ fourth-quarter total revenue and other income more than doubled to $16 billion. That allowed the company to swing back to a profit of $2.6 billion against a loss a year earlier. A near doubling of realized price boosted earnings.
The company said its production, excluding Libya, rose to 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, up by 423,000 boe/d from last year. Production from Libya averaged 41,000 boe/d.
Most of the increase in the company's output came from the Permian, Reuters said. The company acquired Shell’s assets in the top U.S. oilfield for $8.7 billion during the quarter.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 09:01AM ET</span>",Meta's miss creates Big Tech divide: who's got the data,"By Danielle Kaye
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uh oh. Big Tech was cut in two on Wednesday, divided between companies that have great data and those that don't, after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc posted disastrous quarterly results, blaming privacy safeguards from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that made it tougher for advertisers.
A day earlier, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc posted a startlingly strong quarter, thanks to bumper sales of advertising that uses its Google's search data to target ads.
""It's two-tiered,"" said Gene Munster of investment firm Loup Ventures, who called Apple's devices and Google's search service foundations of the internet. ""Facebook continues to see that impact of what it means to be built on top of Apple,"" he said, noting that Apple's privacy changes have had a bigger impact on Facebook than he expected.
Meta's revenue and forecast misses sent the social media company's shares down 20% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, upending a sector-wide positive outlook on the results from Apple and Alphabet.
The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, and peers  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc saw $15 billion in lost value.
""People may have enjoyed a false sense of security following Alphabet's/Google's very healthy and strong Q4 results,"" said Scott Kessler of Third Bridge. Apple's change to its operations system in the middle of last year, said, would hit much of the mobile advertising world in 2022. 
Apple allowed users to block some tracking of their internet use, which has made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. Meta CFO David Wehner said on a conference call with analysts that the impact from Apple's privacy changes could be ""in the order of $10 billion"" for 2022.
While Meta said macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions and inflation contributed to the earnings miss, factors which could have far-reaching effects, analysts and investors focused their punishment on social media.
""It really depends on the company within tech right now,"" said analyst Ryan Reith of IDC, referring to high competition across services, hardware and advertising. ""When you have such strong growth in a handful of tech sectors many will win and many will lose, and there will be continued volatility within.""
Meta CFO Wehner suggested that Apple's relationship with Google was also an issue for Facebook. ""Given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search ads, the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue.""
Meta is investing heavily in the metaverse, which merges the real world and virtual world for work and play, and the tech giant pointed to competition as a challenge for it in the last quarter.

Meta's results came after two weeks of positive outlooks from Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, which instilled investor confidence in sector growth prospects.
""I don’t think it turns around the current relief rally we are seeing in the tech space,"" said analyst Robert Pavlik of Dakota Wealth Management, after Meta's results. But there could be an impact on some advertising-supported companies, he said.

By Akash Sriram and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc advanced nearer to joining peers Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the elite $2 trillion market valuation club on Wednesday as the search giant's shares surged more than 8% following a blowout quarterly report.
Last trading at about $2,975, Alphabet's stock was on track for its largest one-day percentage gain in almost two years, easing concerns around owning Big Tech following a sector-wide selloff in the past few weeks.
Alphabet's stock market value peaked just above $2 trillion after the start of the trading session, and was last at $1.97 trillion. That includes class B shares that do not trade on the stock market and are held by insiders.
A close above $2 trillion would be the first ever for the Mountain View, California-based company.
""The technology sector started 2022 with some of the biggest question marks over it since the dotcom crash more than two decades ago,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""However, the largest and highest quality U.S. tech names continue to deliver the answers the market wants with big earnings beats.""
Shares of Wall Street's most valuable companies have soared in the past two years, driven by pandemic-led shifts in how people work and learn, even as regulators around the world scrutinize them over allegations of breaches of privacy and antitrust concerns.
At least 20 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet's stock after the company late on Tuesday delivered record quarterly sales that topped expectations. The median analyst price target is now $3,450, 16% above its current price.
Alphabet also announced a 20-to-1 stock split, which will give shareholders 19 shares for every share they hold.
Splitting stocks is a method companies use to woo investors by making them more affordable. However, some brokerages, such as Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets, allow investors to buy fractions of shares, making the tactic less effective.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Apple split their stocks in 2020 to make their shares more appealing to mom-and-pop investors.
""The split will make the shares more accessible for retail investors and likely facilitate inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which is somehow still share price-weighted), but it has no fundamental impact,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms, which is set to report results on Wednesday after the bell, was last up 1.1%.
Adding to the rebound in tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc's shares jumped over 5% after its results topped Wall Street expectations. Rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) also rose.

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 23,000 to 238,000 in the week ended Jan. 29, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 245,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 1.63 million in the week ended Jan. 22.
Applications continued to decline after a surge in recent weeks amid an uptick in Covid-19 cases across the country. Claims have largely been falling in the past year, and layoffs are at a record low as companies are desperate to retain and attract talent amid ongoing labor shortages.
The claims data comes ahead of the government’s monthly employment report, which is forecast to show the U.S. added 150,000 jobs in January. A separate report Wednesday showed that payrolls at U.S. companies fell by 301,000 last month, the most since April 2020, according to ADP Research Institute.
On an unadjusted basis, claims decreased to 257,002 last week. Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois were states registering the biggest decreases in unadjusted claims. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Indiana posted the largest increases in applications.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The party is over for technology start-ups rushing to go public at ever-higher valuations, as volatile U.S. stock markets have dampened investor appetite for high-growth stocks. 
A 6% drop in the S&P 500 index and a 75% rise in Wall Street's fear gauge, as the Cboe Volatility Index is known, since the beginning of the year have led many companies to push the pause button on listing plans.
Software startups WeTransfer and Justworks and bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprise are among the half-dozen companies that canceled initial public offerings (IPOs) in January, citing adverse market conditions. Other postponed listings include apparel chain operator Authentic Brands Group, insurance technology start-up TypTap, and real estate investment trust Four Springs Capital Trust.
""You're going to continue to see probably fewer deals launched than you otherwise would have if the market hadn't gotten a lot choppier here,"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Most shares of 396 companies that went public in 2021, excluding special purpose acquisition companies, were already trading well below their flotation price as investors worried about frothy valuations -- down 28% on average, according to Dealogic.
January's sell-off of technology stocks, driven by the prospect that higher interest rates will make investors more risk-averse, further spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended January nearly 9% lower than it started the month.
IPOs raised a total of about $6.9 billion in January, down 83% from the same period last year, according to Dealogic
Companies with plenty of growth but little or no profit to show were snubbed first by IPO investors. 
""The recent and anticipated moves in interest rates is forcing investors to re-value cash flows, growth and risk, translating to a rotation away from the highest growth, riskiest assets across sectors,"" said Andrew Wetenhall, co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.
This raises questions about the timing of major technology offerings expected this year, including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s autonomous vehicle unit Mobileye (F:0ME), social media platform Reddit and delivery startup Gopuff.
Should market volatility continue, it could benefit direct listings at the expense of traditional IPOs, investment bankers say. In a direct listing a company goes public without selling shares though underwriters, and its stock market debut is less vulnerable to market jitters. 
HEALTHY PIPELINE
To be sure, IPO bankers and lawyers have said the pipeline for companies looking to go public in 2022 remains healthy. Several technology unicorns are still planning to go public in the second half of the year. 
""Markets loathe uncertainty, so any alleviation of it should improve the market backdrop, especially for IPOs,"" said Michael Ventura, managing director at RBC Capital Markets.
Tech stocks and the broader market rebounded this week, recovering close to half of their losses in January and giving dealmakers hope the IPO environment will become favorable again soon.

Jimmy Baker, president of B. Riley Securities, said the IPO market recovery may start with companies that generate strong cash flows going public, as investors with little risk tolerance for loss-making unicorns are attracted to offerings that promise to deliver yield.
""There's not a lot of receptivity to IPOs. (However), we expect in the near future, there will be receptivity to yield-oriented opportunities,"" said Baker.

The companies also announced a fund worth $100 million, in Immutable X's IMX tokens, dedicated to supporting creators of NFT content from gaming studios, ""Web3"" and metaverse gaming. 
The market for NFTs hit nearly $25 billion in sales in 2021, compared to just $94.9 million the year before, as the speculative crypto asset exploded in popularity, data from market tracker DappRadar showed. 
While some see NFTs as the future of ownership in the online world, and buying NFTs as a vote of confidence in the development of ""Web3"" or the metaverse, others are baffled as to why so much money is being spent on items which do not physically exist.
NFT sales extend to art, sports collectibles, and music.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are introducing ""Right to Repair"" legislation this week to ensure consumers can get vehicles, electronic devices and agriculture equipment serviced by independent outlets.
Representative Bobby Rush, a Democrat, said Thursday he had introduced legislation to ensure vehicle owners and independent repair shops have equal access to repair and maintenance tools as automakers' dealerships.
Representatives Mondaire Jones, a Democrat, and Republican Victoria Spartz introduced separate legislation Wednesday dubbed the Freedom to Repair Act to reform copyright law to make it easier for consumers to get repairs.
Public Knowledge Policy Counsel Kathleen Burke said the bill would allow ""consumers to repair their own devices without needing to get the Copyright Office’s permission every three years.""
As part of a wide-ranging initiative to boost competition, President Joe Biden has made ensuring people can repair their own products a priority.
Last month, Biden said in too many cases ""if you own a product, from a smartphone to a tractor, you don’t have the freedom to choose how or where to repair that item you purchased.""
Rush's bill would require all tools and equipment, wireless transmission of repair and diagnostic data and access to on-board diagnostic systems needed for repairs be made available to the independent repair industry.
Rush said it would ""end manufacturers’ monopoly on vehicle repair and maintenance and allow Americans the freedom to choose where to repair their vehicles.""
The U.S Federal Trade Commission in July voted to make it a priority to address the issue of manufacturers pushing consumers to use licensed dealers to repair items ranging from smartphones to farm equipment.

Rush's bill would create a committee to provide recommendations to the FTC on addressing barriers to vehicle repairs. 
A group representing major automakers has sued to try to block a Massachusetts voter-approved measure that would expand access to vehicle data and allow independent shops to repair increasingly sophisticated automotive technology.

The fate of its Covid-19 antibody treatment is also an overhang on the stock. The antibody therapies are not currently authorized in any U.S. region, the company said.
The pharmaceutical giant experienced pricing pressure in all its geographies with China accounting for a large part of that, due to policy changes there.
U.S. sales of insulin, Humalog, fell 16% to $602 million on lower realized prices. The company expects competition to weigh on Humalog prices in U.S for longer than it previously expected. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 8% to $8 billion, helped by demand for its Covid-19 antibody therapies and diabetes drugs Trulicity and Jardiance, as well as rheumatoid arthritis medication Olumiant. 
Trulicity sales jumped 25% to $1.9 billion. 
Sales of autoimmune drug Taltz and advanced breast cancer medicine Verzenio were strong too, rising 31% and 43%, respectively.
The company recognized worldwide revenue of $1 billion from Covid-19 antibodies during the quarter compared with $871 million last year. Those sales are under threat now as the Food and Drug Administration has limited the use of those drugs since they were unlikely to work against the Omicron variant.
Excluding revenue from Covid-19 antibodies, the increase in worldwide revenue was 6%.
On an adjusted basis, Lilly reported a quarterly profit of $2.49 per share, beating estimates."

(Reuters) -Compass Group, the world's largest catering firm, said on Thursday its first-quarter revenue was near pre-pandemic levels and stuck to its annual forecast, lifting its shares.
The British company, which serves office workers, students, old-age homes and armed forces across 45 countries, said four of its five main business sectors had exceeded their 2019 revenues.
But while Compass confirmed its full-year forecast for organic revenue to rise up to 25%, it said it was being cautious of any impact from the new COVID-19 coronavirus variant.
""I think the Delta between Q1 and Q2 will really all be about the Omicron impact,"" Compass Chief Executive Dominic Blakemore said on a call with analysts. ""But as we've seen in the UK, we hope that it's short and sharp.""
Shares in Compass climbed 7.7% to 1,781 pence at 1022 GMT, making them the top gainer on the FTSE 100, after it said organic revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 jumped around 39%, much above the nearly 29% expected by analysts on average. Overall revenue reached 97% of its pre-pandemic level.
""The key data point for this quarter was whether Omicron was going to throw Compass off its FY (full-year) guidance, and the strong start to the FY has allowed guidance to be maintained,"" analysts at Bernstein said in a note.
Blakemore said that trends in new business and business from existing clients should remain strong in the second quarter, with ""perhaps a touch of acceleration in pricing"".

Compass, whose food service brands span Levy, Chartwell and Bon Appetit, maintained its full-year profit margin target of more than 6%, with an exit rate of around 7%, as it managed costs and renegotiated contracts to make up for lower trading volumes.

Packaged food makers are grappling with rising prices for commodities such as sugar, wheat and soy, as well as soaring shipping and labor expenses as supply chains were strained during the pandemic.
To counter inflation, Hershey, like its peers,  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co and Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC, has been bumping up product prices in recent months. 
""Pricing will be an important lever for us this year and is expected to drive most of our growth,"" said Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck.
However, Buck cautioned that a surge in Omicron cases has hit the company's facilities as well as its suppliers due to higher absenteeism, and has pressured production at the facilities. 
She expects this to impact the speed at which the chocolate maker can rebuild inventories and accelerate investments in demand-generating activities, which will likely be limited until the second half of the year. 
The Pennsylvania-based company expects an annual adjusted profit of between $7.84 and $7.98 per share, compared with estimates of $7.57 per share. 
Net sales rose to $2.33 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.19 billion a year earlier, compared with estimates of $2.27 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Net income attributable to the company rose to $355.6 million, or $1.62 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $291.4 million, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.69 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.62 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 07:36AM ET</span>",Big miners plug into battery metals joint ventures,"By Clara Denina and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Big miners, under pressure to increase their exposure to minerals needed to drive the electric vehicle revolution, have so far opted for the cautious approach of joint ventures with small explorers rather than buying them outright.
Shareholders will scrutinise quarterly results and statements in this month's earning season for news on battery metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt and lithium, used in batteries and renewable energy.
But the miners will also be keen to retain the loyalty of shareholders they have lured with dividends and buybacks to a high-risk sector that remembers reckless spending in previous commodity booms that were followed by bust.
Joint ventures, rather than outright acquisitions, have the advantage of spreading the risks associated with complex minerals that may not provide the margins of the traditional bulk commodities.
As the trend gathered pace, the world's largest listed BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) this month said it had spent $40 million to advance a nickel project in Tanzania through UK-based private developer Kabanga Nickel. The deal also marks its re-entry into Africa.
Such joint ventures can give miners more geographical reach without full exposure to jurisdictions seen as politically challenging.
Over recent years, world number two miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) has been exploring for copper on Canada-listed junior Midnight Sun's licences in Zambia under a joint venture agreement and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) has been in discussion with Zambian-focused junior Arc Minerals to hunt for copper.
""We expect the diversified miners to enter new geographies in 2022 through the acquisition of early-stage projects,"" said James Whiteside, research director at consultancy WoodMac.
But the consultancy predicts large acquisitions this year will remain constrained by a reluctance to buy at high commodity prices that will leave investment growth across metals and mining at multi-year lows.
BHP's exploration budget for the first half of this year is just $80 million.
That could be a problem for ensuring sufficient battery minerals to meet the expected surge in demand.
In the venture deals, the big miners help with providing for equipment and labour skills, while the assets are mainly run by the smaller exploring company.
""The problem is you need extra supply and ...it's going to need more than M&A,"" Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, said. 

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) head of metals research Michael Widmer also said investments in battery metals markets by major miners will not rival spending and profits of established markets such as iron ore, where high margins are far easier to deliver.
""The reality is that for the big mining companies investment in smaller miners doesn't move the needle that much, but it's good to show that they are in the battery metals,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq index particularly hard hit on the back of a disappointing quarterly report from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 125 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 55 points, or 1.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 350 points, or 2.3%.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock slumped over 20% in premarket trade after the technology conglomerate, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in its stable, missed expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings, including reporting a first-ever decline in global daily active users, and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.
Other social media names, including Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), followed suit, posting premarket hefty losses, while streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) also traded sharply lower after reporting a slowdown in premium subscriber growth.
The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) set to report earnings after the close. The e-commerce giant will be the last of the FAANG group of megacap stocks to report its fourth quarter, and is seen posting $137.75 billion in revenue, which would be 9.7% above 2020's number. 
Other companies scheduled to release quarterly numbers Thursday include Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Merck (NYSE:MRK), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Cigna (NYSE:CI).
Thursday’s weaker tone mean the major Wall Street indices are set to break a four-day winning streak. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed more than 220 points, or 0.6%, higher, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5%.
The labor market will also remain in focus Thursday in the form of the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), especially after Wednesday’s ADP jobs number surprised to the downside with a meaningful drop in payrolls.
While jobless claims have drifted towards 50-year lows in recent months, the numbers have been elevated over the last three weeks, perhaps a reflection of the rising number of Omicron-related infections.
Over in Europe, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in less than two months, while the European Central Bank will hold a press conference at 8:30 AM ET after its monetary policy meeting ends.
Oil prices eased back Thursday but remained near multi-year highs, supported by tight global supply as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia agreed to continue a policy of only limited increases in output.
Additionally, U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, against expectations for an increase.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $87.15 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.3% to $88.29. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 last week.

Investing.com – Spotify stock (NYSE:SPOT) plunged 9% in premarket trading Thursday after the company’s projection of a slowdown in subscriber additions in the first quarter disappointed.
The weak quarterly outlook and a decision to drop its annual guidance come at a time when the company is reeling from a controversy around comedian Joe Rogan, the host of its most popular podcast. The stock is down by almost a fifth of its value since artists started to withdraw their work from Spotify's streaming platform in protest at his airing of what critics called unfounded scare stories about Covid-19 vaccines.   
The episode forced the company to start tagging Covid-related content with an advisory. It also made public its content policy, without making changes to it.
Spotify expects to add only 3 million subscribers in the current quarter, down from 8 million in the three months through December. That will take it to 183 million subscribers by the end of March. 
Total monthly active users are seen rising to 418 million by end-March, up 3% on the quarter. They had risen 7% in the fourth quarter.
""While we have not given full-year guidance any more on subscribers ... we don't expect a material difference in the net additions for either users or subscribers in 2022 relative to 2021,"" Reuters quoted Chief Financial Officer Paul Vogel as saying.
On a year-on-year basis, premium subscribers grew 16% and MAUs 18%.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% to 2.7 billion euro ($3 billion). Ad-supported revenue rose 40% to 394 million euro. The net loss narrowed by more than two-thirds on lower finance costs."

Tesla will perform an over-the-air (OTA) software update to address the issue.
Tesla told NHTSA that as of Jan. 31 it was unaware of any crashes or injuries related to the issue.
Tesla said in a document filed with NHTSA, the South Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute (KATRI) on Jan. 6 brought the condition to Tesla’s attention.
Tesla said on the recalled vehicles a software error may prevent the chime from activating upon vehicle start under certain circumstances.
The automaker said the issue was limited to circumstances
where the chime was interrupted in the preceding drive cycle and the seat belt was not buckled subsequent to that interruption.
Tesla added the issue does not affect the audible seat belt reminder chime from activating when the vehicle exceeds 22 km/h and the driver seat belt is not detected as buckled.
The condition does not impact the accuracy of the accompanying visual seat belt reminder.
Tesla has come under increasing scrutiny from U.S. regulators and issued a number of recalls in recent months. 

On Tuesday, Tesla said it was recalling 53,822 U.S. vehicles with the company's Full Self-Driving (Beta) software that may allow some models to conduct ""rolling stops"" and not come to a complete stop at intersections posing a safety risk.
Tesla will perform an over-the-air software update that disables the ""rolling stop"" functionality, NHTSA said.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",U.S. banks see business lending driving 2022 growth,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for business loans is picking up in the United States as an economic recovery drives consumer spending and encourages companies to bulk up inventories, fueling optimism it will boost banks' 2022 growth. 
However, the outlook for consumer spending is more mixed with demand for home loans, mortgage refinancing and auto loans declining while credit card spending rises. 
As investment banking and trading bonanzas fizzle out, banks are relying on a revival of moribund loan demand to drive profits during 2022.
An increase in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans through the back end of 2021 and start of 2022 has generated optimism. 
""People are rebuilding their inventories,"" Terrance Dolan, chief financial officer for U.S. Bancorp, said last month. ""They're starting to make business investment ahead of the consumer spend and the economic growth that they see in 2022.""
That growth could come in fits and starts this year, analysts and bank executives have said.
The Federal Reserve's weekly loan reports have shown that so far in January total loans were down about 0.8% from the same period early in the fourth quarter. There were modest declines across all types of loans except commercial real estate and auto, which are expected to be short-lived. Compared to a year ago, total loans so far this year were up 3.8%.
""We continue to believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts following the bank's fourth quarter earnings last month.
Banks will also benefit if the Fed comes through with the four rate hikes expected this year. That will boost their net interest income, the difference between interest earned on loans and paid out on deposits.
In the final quarter of 2021, U.S. banks saw a substantial increase in demand for business loans, according to the Fed's quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released on Monday.
That report also showed increased demand for bank commercial real estate (CRE) and credit card loans, and a rise at most banks in inquiries from potential clients about new or existing lines of credit.
Businesses need loans to invest in equipment and deal-making activity, as well as to bolster inventory, the survey found, echoing bank executives who said in January they expect increases from last year to build in 2022.
""We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter, but also in our pipelines, which are the highest they've been in some time,"" said William Rogers (NYSE:ROG), chief executive of Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, after the bank reported fourth quarter earnings last month. 
CONSUMER LOANS MIXED
There are clear signs that demand for commercial and other business loans will increase this year; one measure of net demand hit its highest level https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSL1N2UB20M since 2014. Yet the findings for consumer loans were more mixed. 
Just more than half of banks reported stronger demand for credit card loans in the fourth quarter, while some reported weaker demand for auto loans. Demand was flat for consumer loans, apart from credit cards and car loans. 
Banks reported they expect loans to grow in 2022 in every category except home lending, where demand for refinancing is expected to decline due to increasing interest rates.
KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is one of the banks with significant exposure to the loan categories that are growing-- C&I loans, CRE loans and credit cards.

Mitch Kime, KeyBank's head of consumer lending and payments, said in an interview last month that ""an abundance of confidence"" is resulting in strong lending demand.
""The mortgage refinancing boom is likely to pull back, but because of consumer confidence we are seeing higher spending,"" said Kime. ""Credit card spend is really climbing right now--even in January we are seeing higher activity--and I think that speaks to the confidence.""

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Carlyle's Q4 earnings jump nearly fourfold on record asset sales,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said on Thursday its fourth-quarter distributable earnings increased almost fourfold thanks to a record level of asset sales from its private equity portfolio that was partly offset by rising compensation expenses.
The Washington, D.C.-based firm said its distributable earnings rose to a record $903 million in the fourth quarter, up from $237 million a year earlier. That resulted in an after-tax distributable earnings per share of $2.01, which outperformed the average Wall Street analysts estimate of $1.21 per share, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
Carlyle cashed out a record $15.3 billion worth of its investments during the quarter and spent $14 billion on new acquisitions, taking advantage of a favorable economic environment, Chief Executive Kewsong Lee said in an interview.
Mergers and acquisitions activity reached an all-time high in 2021, as cheap capital because of low interest rates, pent-up demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, and buoyant public markets allowed private equity firms such as Carlyle to strike deals and sell investments for top dollar.
""The record realizations is driven because of incredibly strong investment performance and investment work over the years. When you create fundamental value and drive growth at our companies, you're going to benefit from strong realizations and exit activity,"" Lee said.
Carlyle's earnings are in line with the results of peer Blackstone (NYSE:BX), whose distributable earnings also rose to a record high in the fourth quarter.
For its quarterly fund performance, Carlyle said its private equity portfolio appreciated by 6%, credit funds rose 1%, and assets managed under its secondaries franchise gained 7%. By comparison, Blackstone's private equity funds grew by 4.8%, while its credit arm posted a net return of 3.1% in the same period.
Carlyle paid out $244 million as cash-based compensation and benefits during the quarter, up 21% from the $202 million spent last year, reflecting the cost of additional hiring in its investment teams and increased payment of so-called carried interest to executives.

""It's all about creating the right culture. It's all about pay for performance. We had a record year and we care about alignment,"" Lee said.
Carlyle's total assets under management rose 3% during the quarter to $301 billion, driven by strong fundraising particularly in its credit business that was partially offset by the record asset sales. It ended the quarter with $84 billion of unspent capital and declared a dividend of 25 cents per share.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>","Siemens Gamesa sets out move to ""reset"" by replacing CEO","By Isla Binnie
MADRID (Reuters) -Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa pledged a ""reset"" on Thursday, introducing a new chief executive to try to revive its fortunes after a series of losses which have drawn painful scrutiny from parent Siemens Energy. 
The northern Spain-based company blamed the latest in a series of losses on long-standing supply chain disruptions, high raw material costs, and problems developing an onshore turbine. 
It confirmed a gloomy outlook for full-year profits.
Wind turbine makers including Danish market leader Vestas have been squeezed by rising costs for raw materials such as steel and to transport parts and products, prompting them to raise prices. 
Siemens Gamesa's woes have been compounded by delays rolling out a new onshore turbine. Its most optimistic prediction is now for a paper-thin core profit margin of 1% this year, but it warned this metric could be as low as negative 4%.
Jochen Eickholt, managing director of German parent Siemens Energy will take over as CEO on March 1, replacing Andreas Nauen, who had been in the job for less than two years.
""The rationale was obvious ... not that I like it but I fully understand it,"" Nauen told analysts on a conference call. ""I'm sad so often I had to present disappointments here."" 
Siemens Energy has grown increasingly frustrated by Siemens Gamesa's losses.
People familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the German company has stepped up efforts to take more control, including exploring the possibility of acquiring the 33% stake in Siemens Gamesa it does not already own.
Asked about this possibility by a reporter, Siemens Gamesa Chairman Miguel Angel Lopez said: ""We don't know anything.""
Madrid-listed shares in Siemens Gamesa rose as much as 3% in early trading but fell back into negative territory. Siemens Energy's shares were down around 0.6% in Frankfurt at 1025 GMT.
Siemens Gamesa has started charging customers to ship large turbine parts, having traditionally shouldered that cost itself, Nauen said.
He emphasised the difficulties in getting components in the first place: ""Ships are not arriving… you are basically chasing your parts."" 
Turbine makers are ""squashed in the middle"" of the wind industry as the final price of wind power has cratered while production costs have climbed, Nauen added. 
""If steel gets more expensive: our problem in most cases, if copper gets more expensive: our problem."" Looking to the future: ""I don't think we will ever see prices going to pre-COVID levels.""

A plan to raise cash by selling its wind farm development business is ""going really well"", Nauen said.

Investing.com – T-Mobile stock surged 7.7% in premarket Thursday after the company’s robust outlook on subscriber additions in the current year, banking on a high-speed 5G network where it claims a lead over rivals.
Postpaid net customer additions are expected to be 5 million-5.5 million. T-Mobile has been ahead of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) in rolling out 5G network and was unaffected by the recent conflict between telecom services providers and airlines over airwaves.
The outlook on subscriber additions compares with AT&T’s forecast of growth slowing down after a strong year.
T-Mobile ended the year with 646,000 high-speed internet customers, exceeding its goal of half a million.
Total net customer additions were 1.8 million in the fourth quarter and 5.8 million in the 12 months, the highest annual number in five years. It closed the year with a total customer count of close to 109 million.
Total revenue rose 2.2% year-on-year to near $21 billion. Adjusted profit per share fell 43% to 34 cents owing to costs related to its merger with Sprint.
The company expects merger costs to be at least $4.5 billion in 2022, around 50% more than last time. Merger synergies are seen between $5 billion and $5.3 billion, up from $3.8 billion in 2021."

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 05:41AM ET</span>","BlackRock pledges to help clients navigate, shape net-zero transition","By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said it will increase the products and services it offers to help investors ""navigate, drive and invent"" the transition to a net zero world, in a letter to clients on Wednesday seen by Reuters.
Decarbonisation has become a matter of when, not if, with countries accounting for 95% of global emissions committed to reach net-zero emissions in the coming decades, BlackRock said.
The speed of transition, however, is uncertain, with the rate of recovery from the pandemic impact leading to a revived focus on fossil fuels as their prices surge and energy supplies run short.
Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand, who was among the executives who signed the letter dated Feb. 3, said markets were beginning to price in the effects of the climate transition on asset prices, which he said was ""creating a significant opportunity for our clients"". 
To help investors, BlackRock said it would create the BlackRock Transition Scenario to show how it expects the shift from a fossil fuel economy to impact technologies, sectors and regions.
Already trillions of dollars have moved into funds and products focused on environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) investment. 
In 2021, 70% of a selection of broad-market ESG indices outperformed their non-ESG counterparts, with average outperformance of over 100 basis points, BlackRock said.
It plans to launch more active and passively managed products to help clients access ""climate-aware"" strategies, and will expand its iShares strategies to include climate benchmarks, as well as incorporate climate analytics into its consulting services.
For those keen to do more, it will create new funds and strategies to drive the transition, for example by funding green energy technologies that have yet to reach scale, such as sustainable aviation fuel.
In conclusion, the letter said BlackRock was helping clients to ""navigate, drive, and invent this economic and financial transformation"".

Fossil-Free Finance Campaign Manager with the Sierra Club Ben Cushing said BlackRock deserved credit for its leadership but more ""hard choices"" were required to prevent investment in polluting companies. 
""The accelerating climate crisis means that the gap between current progress and the action that’s needed is ever-growing,"" he said.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nordea Bank unveiled more ambitious profitability targets on Thursday but the Nordic region's biggest lender also said it expects costs to rise this year.
The Helsinki-based bank is now aiming for a return on equity (RoE) above 13% for 2025 and raised its 2022 target to above 11% from 10% as it benefits from a boom in mortgage lending and growing assets under management.
However, Nordea said costs in 2022 would be higher than 2021, and shares in the company lost some 2.5%, with the Helsinki market down 1.2% around noon.
""...the 49-50% cost income target would include investments for growth and higher regulatory costs which include the Swedish bank tax. This compares with consensus currently at 48% according to Visible Alpha consensus,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a note.
Nordea is playing catch-up with Handelsbanken on its profitability targets. The Swedish bank reported a RoE of 11.5% in October for the first three quarters of 2021 and a RoE of 12.4% for the third quarter.
Danish peer Danske Bank has a RoE target of 8.5-9% for 2023. 
""I'm happy that we have surpassed our 2022 financial targets one year ahead of schedule and that all of our business areas have met their respective targets,"" Nordea Chief Executive Frank Vang-Jensen said in a statement.
The group reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
Nordea's fourth-quarter net profit rose to 1.02 billion euros ($1.15 billion) from 725 million euros a year ago, beating the mean forecast of 949.1 million seen by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
""Our mortgage lending grew by 6%, SME (small and medium enterprise) lending by 6% and assets under management... by 17%, reaching all-time-high levels.""
Nordea's board proposed a dividend of about 0.69 euros per share for 2021, up 77% from 0.39 euros per share for 2020.
""Our capital position is one of the strongest in Europe,"" Vang-Jensen told a conference call.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 05:11AM ET</span>",BBVA's net profit boosted by Mexico though capital takes a hit,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) -BBVA's net profit rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter thanks to a strong performance in its biggest market Mexico though its capital ratio took a hit from a share buyback programme, the Spanish bank said on Thursday.
Like its bigger Spanish rival Santander (MC:SAN), BBVA (MC:BBVA) has been expanding in emerging economies where it see greater opportunities for growth as it struggles to boost income in more mature markets. 
Analysts broadly welcomed the results but cast some doubt on the bank's capital hit and BBVA shares fell as much as 5.3% before recovering to trade 3.2% lower at 0850 GMT.
""We were disappointed with capital as its fully loaded ratio ended 45 basis points below our estimate and consensus,"" JB Capital said in a note, adding that the negative capital hit also came from risk-weighted asset price inflation.
BBVA finished 2021 with a core Tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio of 12.75% compared with 14.48% in September after deducting 3.5 billion euros ($3.95 billion), the full hit from its ongoing share buyback programme. 
The bank, which targets a capital ratio within the range of 11.5% to 12%, said it would implement the remaining 2 billion euros of the programme by Oct. 15.
Overall, BBVA booked a net profit of 1.34 billion euros in the October to December period, above a 1.02 billion euro forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. 
EMERGING MARKETS
Mexico and Turkey are among the key regions BBVA is betting on to help meet higher profitability and cost targets under a 2022-2024 strategic plan outlined in mid-November.
In Mexico, which accounted for more than 50% of BBVA's profit, a strong insurance performance helped boost net profit by 10.9% from the previous quarter and 36.2% from a year earlier. Net interest income a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 12.8% from a year ago.
BBVA said that in Turkey, which makes up about 12% of its results, net profit when translated into euros more than doubled in the quarter from a year earlier though it was down 21.6% compared with the previous three months. Net interest income in Turkey rose 27% from last year.
BBVA's full-year net profit more than trebled compared with 2020 to 4.65 billion euros, surpassing the bank's 3.51 billion net profit in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, as well as analyst expectations of 4.33 billion euros.
The group's overall net interest income rose 14.4% to 3.98 billion euros, above the 3.75 billion euros forecast by analysts. Full-year results were also helped by a decline of more than 41% in total impairment charges.

BBVA announced a cash dividend of 0.23 euros per share, taking the total 2021 distribution to 0.31 euros, leaving its payout at 44% against full-year earnings - in line with its new policy of returning 40% to 50% to shareholders.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank on Thursday maintained its 2023 profitability target and said it expected to increase profits this year, but uncertainty over dividend payments brought potential money laundering fines back in focus.
Denmark's biggest lender has been dogged by a money laundering scandal since 2018 in its former Estonia branch, and remains under investigation by authorities in Denmark, Estonia, France and the United States.
Danske Bank said it would propose a dividend of 2 Danish crowns for 2021, with another 5.5 crowns ""intended"" to be paid out in three tranches later in the year. 
This approach was taken to ensure ""a prudent capital management with a high degree of flexibility in light of the Estonia matter, where we remain unable to estimate any potential outcome or timing,"" the bank said in a statement.
""We really believe that is the best thing to do for our shareholders and our stakeholders,"" CEO Carsten Egeriis told reporters.
Although splitting dividend payments into tranches should not be a concern for investors, ""it is an indication that a conclusion to the (Estonia) case is drawing closer,"" said Jyske Bank analyst, Anders Haulund Vollesen.
Danske reported fourth quarter net profit slightly above expectations and said it expected net profit for 2022 between 13 and 15 billion Danish crowns ($1.97-$2.28 billion), compared to 12.9 billion last year.
Danske affirmed its aim of reaching a return on equity of between 8.5% and 9% in 2023, a goal it lowered in November.
""I feel fully comfortable with that, I very much believe that the momentum and trajectory that we are seeing in our business, supports the targets that we set,"" Egeriis said.
Danske's shares opened down nearly 6% and traded 2.4% lower at 0946 GMT, partly dragged lower by higher-than-expected operating costs in the fourth quarter. 

""Danske Bank has cemented itself as by far the least profitable Scandinavian major bank, and this will not change in the coming years,"" Nordnet analyst Per Hansen said in a note, adding that the results were in line with expectations.

Investing.com – Stock of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) plunged 20% in premarket trading Thursday as December quarter dealt a rude jolt to it – a first-ever decline in global daily active users in its history.
DAUs declined from the September quarter to 1.929 billion in October-December. Earnings also fell below expectations as costs surged, due largely to heavy investment in virtual and augmented reality technologies that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said are the company's future. Capital expenditure of $29 billion-34 billion is planned for data centers and network infrastructure this year.
Facebook and social media rivals like TikTok and YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have enjoyed a scorching run over the last two years, as at-home users logged in for hours at a stretch to engage with families, watch content and shop online during the pandemic. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 20% to near $34 billion thanks to user growth, more clicks on its ads and higher prices for them.
However, that unprecedented growth is now suffering from user fatigue and increasing headwinds in the form of tighter oversight.
Meta is also finding it harder to sell targeted advertisements due to privacy changes implemented last year by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's new policy, which has also troubled several other apps that rely on tracking users to help sell ads, will cost Meta $10 billion in revenue this year, Zuckerberg told an analyst call.
The company is now forecasting its current-quarter revenue to be $28 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up a relatively modest 7% on the year. The company also expects inflation and supply chain disruptions to hurt advertiser budgets.
The company has attempted to go beyond its money-spinner Facebook but achieved mixed success. Last year, it had to pause work on Instagram Kids due to a public outcry over its impact on the young.  Zuckerberg said Meta’s rival to TikTok, Reels, is growing quickly, but monetization has been slow.

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%. Last month, the tech-heavy index fell as much as 19% from its all-time high in November as investors dumped highly valued growth stocks on prospects of faster-than-expected rate hikes.
""The temptation to step in and buy into the sell-off in high growth stocks should be avoided,"" said Andrew Slimmon, a managing director at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
""Once the fever breaks, it's done for quite a while.""
An unexpected decline in private payrolls helped stabilize U.S. Treasury yields as investors weighed its potential impact on Friday's broader jobs report.
Record high euro zone inflation of 5.1% in January defied expectations of a drop to 4.4%, sending German government bond yields to multi-year highs and the euro surging.

Several Asia markets, including China, were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Investor sentiment has been swinging between concerns over Federal Reserve and other central banks' tightening and confidence in the economic recovery. Wednesday's earnings outlook is helping to ease the uncertainty, but stubborn inflation and geopolitical risks remain a threat. 
""The tug of war between higher interest rates and corporate earnings continues,"" said Jake Manoukian, who leads U.S. investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
Markets are pricing in a string of rate hikes from the Fed and the Bank of England, analysts said. 
The BoE meets on Thursday, and markets expect the central bank to increase UK rates.
Fed officials sought to play down the chance of a half-point rate rise in March. Though he said he saw three successive hikes starting in March, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard pushed back at the idea of an initial half-percentage point move.
Friday's U.S. non-farm payroll figures will also be closely watched.
OIL EYES OPEC+ 
Oil prices jumped on Wednesday, closing in on a seven-year high, after OPEC+ stuck to its planned output increase despite pressure from top consumers to raise production more quickly.

By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1%.
Meetings by both the ECB and BOE later in the session are the main events Thursday, but ahead of them, earnings season has continued in full flow.
Shell (BS:SHELl) stock rose 0.7% after the oil major announced an $8.5 billion share buyback program and lifted its dividend, supported by fourth-quarter earnings that comfortably exceeded expectations on the back of surging energy prices.  
Additionally, Compass (LON:CPG) stock surged over 7% after the catering giant announced that its quarterly revenue has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels, helped by new business and strong client retention.
Publicis (PA:PUBP) stock rose 2.3% after the world's third-biggest advertising agency released 2021 earnings ahead of expectations, forecasting organic sales growth of 4% to 5% this year. 
On the flip side, BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock fell 3% and ING (AS:INGA) stock slumped 4.2% with both banks increasing their net profits in the fourth quarter, but by less than had been expected after strong results from a number of their regional peers.
And Chile-focused copper miner  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) remained under pressure, touching a new 52-week low amid concerns about the new government's intentions toward the mining sector. Antofagasta stock was down 0.2%.
Later, the European Central Bank is widely expected to keep policy unchanged but pressure is mounting on the institution to act, given data released on Wednesday showing that inflation in the Eurozone rose to 5.1% in January, the highest ever for the region, despite expectations for a drop to 4.4%. 
The Bank of England has already started tightening its monetary policy, and is expected to deliver another rate hike later in the session after surprising the markets with an increase of 15 basis points in December.
The economic data slate in Europe will center around final purchasing manager’s index data from most of the Eurozone for January later in the session, but Eurozone producer prices for December are also due.
Oil prices eased back Thursday but remained near multi-year highs, supported by tight global supply as a group of top producers stuck to its plan for limited increases in output.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia agreed on Wednesday to add 400,000 barrels per day to its crude output, continuing the gradual increases it started in August, despite pressure from major consumers to raise output more quickly.
Offering additional support, U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, against expectations for an increase.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.82 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $89.12. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 on Friday.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>",Roche sees slower 2022 sales growth as COVID tests demand eases,"By Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) -Swiss drugmaker Roche said on Thursday sales growth would slow this year as it braces for less demand for its COVID-19 medicines and tests, expecting immunity against the novel coronavirus to prevail in the population from about April. 
In an earnings statement, the company said it expected currency-adjusted 2022 sales to be flat or grow in the low-single digits, below last year's 9% gain. 
Roche anticipates sales of COVID-19 medicines and diagnostics to decrease by about 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.17 billion) to around 5 billion francs, it added.
It proposed raising its 2021 dividend to 9.30 francs per share but its stock fell 2.6% on the outlook. 
Group earnings edged higher in 2021 as brisk demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tools and new prescriptions for drugs such as Hemlibra against haemophilia and cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq offset a sales decline in older cancer drugs.
For now, demand for its rapid antigen tests as well as lab-processed PCR tests remained strong, but Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan told journalists on a call he was preparing for the pandemic to slow from the April-to-June quarter.
He said the diagnostics unit's high-throughput processing machines provided a competitive advantage. ""There is just not enough qualified lab personnel... here we have a big advantage because our platforms are the most automated.""
He cautioned his predictions on the pandemic's end had been wrong before but relief from the second quarter was his best assumption.
The company added the 2022 COVID-19 dynamics would depend on the as-yet unknown duration of immunity acquired from vaccination and past infections. Reflecting the uncertainty, Roche said those people could start contracting the disease again from mid-year or retain immunity for four years or longer.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 03:25AM ET</span>","Former ANZ unit fined $4.3 million for ""inappropriately"" advising clients","(Reuters) -An Australian court has ordered RI Advice Group Pty Ltd, a former unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, to pay A$6 million ($4.28 million) in penalty for ""inappropriately advising clients"", the country's securities regulator said on Thursday.
The action relates to a case where the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) alleged that RI Advice failed to prevent and penalise the conduct of its former financial advisor, John Doyle, while advising on investments in complex financial products.
The court said RI Advice did not have the internal mechanisms to bring to notice and penalise such conduct of a financial adviser at the time.
Doyle was an authorised representative of RI Advice between May 2013 and June 2016. The firm was an ANZ financial advice business until 2018, when it was acquired by Insignia Financial Ltd. 
Australia's lenders and financial institutions have been under intense scrutiny since a 2018 Royal Commission inquiry found widespread shortcomings in the sector, forcing companies and regulators to take swift action.
The commission had also looked into the conduct of RI Advice and Doyle as a case study on 'bad advice'.
""The A$6 million penalty handed down by the Court against RI Advice sends a strong message to financial services licensees to properly monitor the advice given by their advisers to make sure consumers are protected,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said. 
A spokesperson for Insignia said the court found that the governance standards of RI Advice have improved since the incident and it was not required to appoint an independent expert to review its compliance procedures.
ANZ said it was not a party to the proceedings that began after it had ceased ownership.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Gardening equipment maker Husqvarna posted record profits on Thursday as locked down consumers spent big on domestic projects, but it signalled that the supply bottlenecks that weighed during 2021 would remain an issue this year. 
Full-year operating profit at the world's biggest manufacturer of gardening power tools such as trimmers and lawn mowers jumped 57% to 5.75 billion crowns ($624 million) on organic sales growth of 15%. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 5.66 billion crown profit.
""The stay-at-home trend has contributed positively while we strengthened our market positions in prioritised strategic segments such as battery-powered products, robotic mowers and handheld products,"" CEO Henric Andersson said in a statement. 
""We work continuously to overcome challenges in our supply chain, including increasing our inventories in preparation for the upcoming season."" 
The Swedish group does the bulk of its business towards the end of the first quarter and in the second, ahead of and during the peak gardening season in the northern hemisphere.
In its seasonally weak fourth quarter, losses narrowed sharply by a bigger-than-expected 86%, to 132 million crowns.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>",Succession scramble grips Italian family firms after COVID scare,"By Valentina Za, Elisa Anzolin and Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - For years Dionisio Archiutti had seen his father toy with the idea of bringing a new investor into the family business, but he knew time would not necessarily help the 80-year-old decide.
""Italian entrepreneurs often tighten their grip on their firms as they get older, fearing there may not be a future without them at the helm,"" he said. 
Yet a year into the pandemic, Giacomo Carlo Archiutti sold 30% of the kitchen manufacturer he founded in 1967 in Italy's industrial north east to a private equity firm.
Pre-pandemic the Archiuttis would have stood out as a rarity, an Italian family-owned business welcoming an external investor as a first step to addressing succession planning.
Now, however, bankers say they are overwhelmed by requests to examine possible deals from small and mid-sized (SMEs) companies facing challenges from supply chain disruption to financing investments required to keep them up to speed with digital and environmental business standards.
""The pandemic has shown companies they can get hit by a tsunami, making them aware they need to deal with generational change,"" NB Aurora Managing Director Francesco Sogaro said.
For the Archiuttis, NB Aurora now has two of Veneta Cucine's five board seats and works alongside the family to steer its growth strategy in a ""subtle yet effective"" way.
""You certainly can't expect to tell businessmen of my father's generation what to do. Yet thanks to the fund's expertise we've taken some bolder steps,"" Archiutti said. 
Family-owned businesses are the backbone of the Italian economy and nearly a third of them are in the hands of a leader in their 70s, data from Bocconi University's AUB research hub shows. And succession remains a deep-seated problem. 
GRAPHIC: CEO over 70 years old, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwxnkavo/Over70.png ""We are small and we're old,"" said Francesco Casoli, chairman of AIDAF, the association of family-owned companies, which according to data firm Cerved account for nearly 70% of Italy's 148,530 SMEs.
Clingy owners have been blamed by the Bank of Italy for holding back growth, by blocking investments needed to drive productivity and putting off skilled managers. 
The COVID-19 crisis, which has caused more than 147,000 deaths in Italy, the second-worst toll in Europe after Britain, combined with the worst economy slump since World War II, appears to have convinced some to let go.
""Deals we'd been discussing for years, without owners ever finding the courage to take the leap, suddenly gained traction,"" NB Aurora's Sogaro added.
The Illy and Vergnano families, for example, both welcomed a minority investor into their respective coffee businesses last year as they pursue international expansion plans.
COVID CATALYST 
""Fear is always the greatest motivator,"" AUB Director Guido Corbetta said. 
""The production freeze during the first COVID wave sent companies panicking. They got over the worst only to find themselves wrestling with skyrocketing energy prices and scarce raw materials and components.""
For Stefano Giudici, Nomura's Italy head of investment banking, companies which emerged as winners in the pandemic have the additional incentive of seizing on high market valuations at a time when pent-up demand and European Union recovery spending boost their growth prospects. 
""These two elements create a momentum many business owners want to take advantage of,"" he said.
Veneta Cucine's 2021 sales soared 40% to around 280 million euros, with demand for home furniture at its strongest since the 1990s, Archiutti says.
Bankers say double digit multiples for corporate valuations have become the norm.
Deals targeting Italian companies rose 122% last year to a record 85.5 billion euros, consultancy EY said, forecasting a similar trend this year although Omicron and inflation pose a threat. Nearly a quarter of the total were private equity deals.
EY calculates that 86% of last year's 705 merger and acquisition transactions in Italy involved privately-held companies.
JOIN THE CLUB 
To catch more mid-sized business, private equity firms Deutsche Beteiligungs AG, Gilde Buy Out Partners and Bregal Unternhemerkapital set up shop in Milan last year.
And the surge in demand for private capital in a market still under-penetrated by funds has also led to a proliferation of so-called club deals, backed by groups of small investors.
QCapital, a club deal firm targeting SMEs with revenue of up to 40 million euros, said it had met with some 120 companies interested tapping outside capital since starting in May.
""Investment platforms like ours are springing up like mushrooms,"" Francesco Niutta, one of the founders, said.
The deal rush represents an opportunity for banks which are increasingly combining advisory and corporate finance services for SMEs with their wealth management activities, enabling them to funnel money from ultra-wealthy individuals into companies.
Foreign banks are looking to cash in too.
In September,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) launched a new Bank for Entrepreneurs division with a 30-strong team in Italy and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) hired more bankers in Investment Banking Advisory under European leader Vincenzo De Falco.

To defend a patch it has traditionally dominated, Italian investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) has in the past two years doubled its team of bankers dedicated to M&A for mid-market firms, which it combines with private banking services. 
Mediobanca handled 25 such deals in 2021, doubling the 2020 figure.($1 = 0.8867 euros)

The French company said growth had been fuelled by its digital and data-driven businesses Sapient and Epsilon, and that it was expecting to maintain this year's record 17.5% operating margin and 1.4 billion euro ($1.58 billion) cash flow in 2022.
Publicis posted organic growth of 10% reaching 10.49 billion euros in revenue last year, beating the 9.1% forecast by analysts in a company-provided consensus. The group's 2022 guidance also landed above analysts' 3% estimate.
After spending some 300 million euros last year, Publicis is planning to double its acquisitions budget to up to 600 million euros as it looks to buy medium-sized firms with expertise in new digital media and first-party data.
Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said the company's 2019 acquisition of Epsilon, which has access to its own database of consumer data, had helped Publicis navigate a global shift in advertising trends as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) looks to phase out use of third-party tracking cookies.
""Today we are able to tell our clients that with our solution, they are no longer dependant on cookies,"" Sadoun told journalists during a call.
Regulators are paying close attention to Google's plans, which have sparked fears among advertisers that their removal will make them more reliant on buying ads from Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) because of their vast user databases.
Sadoun added that the automotive sector - which represents 16% of Publicis sales and has been badly hit by component shortages - had cut less ad spending than expected and benefited from data that helped predict consumer demand.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp slid as much as 8.8% in early trade in Tokyo on Thursday after four consecutive days of gains as concerns about its gaming business re-emerge amid component shortages and competition from heavyweight rivals.
Sony fell almost 13% last month after rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it was buying ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), but more recently recovered some ground as the group made its own deal for ""Destiny"" developer Bungie. 
The Japanese conglomerate on Wednesday reported an estimate-smashing third quarter profit on the back of strong box office receipts for Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and a one-off gain, while its gaming unit squeezed out a quarterly profit rise in part due to lower costs. 
Sony is struggling to produce enough PlayStation 5 (PS5) units to meet demand amid component shortages and logistics snarl-ups. It sold fewer units - 3.9 million - in the third quarter than in the same period a year earlier. 
The bottlenecks forced a downgrade to Sony's full-year PS5 sales target to 11.5 million units from 14.8 million units. Console makers often take a hit on new hardware sales as they build out their install base. 
There is also speculation Sony will be forced to follow Microsoft's move to offer games on its Game Pass subscription service, potentially squeezing margins. 
""We see divisional profitability coming under much pressure going forward,"" Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, wrote in a note. 
Sony on Wednesday signalled aggressive plans to maintain its gaming lead, saying it aims to double first-party gaming revenues and launch at least 10 live service titles, which offer continuous and updated play. 

""It's actually a big change of course for PlayStation and an area where they were very passive,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.

In May, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said dropping a radar sensor from its partially automated driving system would address the so-called “phantom braking” issue, which some Tesla drivers have long complained about.
The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that owner reports of phantom braking to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rose to 107 complaints in the past three months, compared with only 34 in the preceding 22 months. 
""NHTSA is aware of complaints received about forward collision avoidance and is reviewing them through our risk-based evaluation process,"" a NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement. 
""If the data show that a risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately.""
In October, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 vehicles over a version of its Full Self-Driving beta software that caused unnecessary braking or false collision warning.
Tesla said that false braking increases ""the risk of a rear-end collision from a following vehicle,"" adding that it is not aware of crashes or injuries related to this condition.
The NHTSA has been also investigating Tesla's advanced driver assistant system following vehicle crashes involving emergency vehicles, while probing Tesla's decision to allow games to be played on a vehicle screen while a car is moving. Tesla later dropped the gaming feature.

Tesla recently recalled 53,822 U.S. vehicles with the company's Full Self-Driving Beta software that may allow some models to roll through stop signs, posing a safety risk.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest said on Thursday he is launching criminal proceedings against Meta Platform Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in an Australian court, alleging that it breached anti-money laundering laws and its platform is used to scam Australians.
Forrest, Australia's richest man and chairman of Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY), said he was taking the action to stop people losing money to clickbait advertising scams, such as ones using his image to promote cryptocurrency schemes.
The lawsuit filed by Forrest in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia alleges Facebook ""failed to create controls or a corporate culture to prevent its systems being used to commit crime."" 
It also alleges Facebook was criminally reckless by not taking sufficient steps to stop criminals from using its social media platform to send scam advertisements to defraud Australian users.
The lawsuit comes after Forrest said he made several requests asking Facebook to prevent his image from being used to promote investment plans, including in an open letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in November 2019.
Facebook, which changed its name to Meta last year, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said that in general it has always taken a ""multifaceted approach"" to stop such ads appearing and had blocked advertisers. 
""We're committed to keeping these people off our platform,"" a spokesperson for Meta said in an emailed statement.
Some advertisements, which have used Forrest's image and claimed to promote cryptocurrency investment schemes, have appeared on Facebook since March 2019, the lawsuit said.
""This action is being taken on behalf of those everyday Australians – Mums and Dads, Grans and Grandads – who work all their lives to gather their savings and to ensure those savings aren't swindled away by scammers,"" Forrest said in a statement.
    Under Australian law, a private prosecution of a foreign corporation for alleged offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code requires the consent of the country's attorney general. 
    ""The Attorney-General has given her consent to the private prosecution against Facebook in relation to alleged offences under subsection 400.7(2) of the Criminal Code,"" said Steven Lewis, principal of Mark O'Brien Legal, which will represent Forrest in the case. 
    The office of Attorney General Michaelia Cash did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.      
If Facebook is found guilty, it will face a maximum penalty of A$126,000 ($90,000) on each of three charges, Lewis said. 
An initial hearing has been set for March 28, Forrest said.
In September last year, Forrest filed a separate civil case against Facebook in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.

Facebook has been under pressure in Australia after disagreeing initially with a new law that required it and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to pay for links to media companies' content.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc's shares plunged more than 20% late on Wednesday after the social media company posted a weaker-than-expected forecast, blaming Apple's privacy changes and increased competition for users from rivals like TikTok. 
Facebook’s global daily active users declined from the previous quarter for the first time, to 1.929 billion from 1.930 billion. 
Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram. It also cited macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions.
The 18-year-old tech giant, which also faces pressure from platforms like TikTok and Google's YouTube, said it expected slowing revenue growth in the coming quarter due to increased competition for users' time and a shift of engagement toward such features as its short video offering Reels, which generate less revenue. 
Facebook reported 2.91 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter, showing no growth compared with the previous quarter. 
The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion of its market value, while peers  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc lost another $15 billion in value.
Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down nearly 2%.
Meta, owner of the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter.
Meta's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, told analysts on a conference call that the impact of Apple's privacy changes could be ""in the order of $10 billion"" for 2022.
Apple's changes to its operating software give users the choice to prevent apps from tracking their online activity for ads, making it harder for advertisers that rely on data to develop new products and know their market.
Meta forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""It's clear that there are many big roadblocks ahead as Meta faces tough new competition for ad revenue such as TikTok, and as it contends with ongoing ad targeting and measurement challenges from Apple's iOS changes,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Aho Williamson.
The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""I'm encouraged by the progress we made this past year in a number of important growth areas like Reels, commerce, and virtual reality, and we'll continue investing in these and other key priorities in 2022 as we work towards building the metaverse,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings release. 
In Meta's earnings call, he said competition for users was one factor impacting the business, mentioning short video app TikTok by name and emphasizing Meta's commitment to providing services for young adults.
Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.
Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future."" 
Reality Labs posted revenue of about $2.3 billion in 2021. The company has not made public the sales numbers for its virtual reality Quest headsets.
The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play. Meta did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball (NYSE:BLL) Metaverse ETF. 
The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. 

""Investors looking at Meta are starting to realize that buying their stock is no longer mostly an investment into their ad platform,"" said Flynn Zaiger, CEO of social media agency Online Optimism. ""Investing in Meta now looks more like a commitment that you believe that the metaverse will replace much of the internet consumers' experience today.""
Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) will conduct meetings on Thursday to consider the next steps in talks for a new contract covering workers at U.S. refineries, chemical plants and oil pipelines, according to a text message to members on Wednesday seen by Reuters.
The USW and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), the lead oil industry negotiator, agreed on Monday night to extend talks for a new contract on a rolling-24-hour basis. 
The pause in negotiations came after the USW rejected Marathon's ""final"" offer of a pay raise of 9% over three years, people familiar with the matter said.
Negotiators for the two sides did not meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Marathon urged the USW to accept the ""comprehensive, final settlement"" offered on Monday night, while USW International President Tom Conway said oil companies must recognize the sacrifices made by workers to keep refineries and chemical plants operating during the pandemic.
Under the extension terms, the existing labor contract remains in place with a 24-hour notice required by either side to end it. The existing three-year contract, negotiated in 2019, provided an 11% pay increase over the period. 
If a strike is called, it likely will follow the pattern of the 2015 work stoppage, which began on Feb. 1 and expanded to 12 refineries, which accounted for a fifth of U.S. crude oil processing capacity, and three chemical plants before an agreement was reached.

The USW and oil companies have prepared for a possible work stoppage with the union ready to put up picket lines, while the companies have trained temporary replacement workers, the sources said.
During the 2015 strike, one refinery shut down and others cut production to half capacity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is confident that aviation safety concerns about 5G C-Band deployment will be addressed ""safely with minimal disruptions,"" the head of the FAA will tell U.S. lawmakers on Thursday, according to testimony seen by Reuters.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson will tell a House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee that in the coming weeks FAA will use testing data to ""safely enable additional 5G deployment.""
The aviation industry and FAA has warned 5G interference can impact sensitive airplane electronics like radio altimeters.
Dickson, a pilot, noted radio altimeters are one of the most crucial pieces of safety equipment aboard an aircraft and are used in low visibility landings. 
""Harmful interference affecting any of these systems has the potential to be catastrophic,"" Dickson's testimony says. ""There is no scenario under which harmful interference is acceptable from a safety standpoint.""
On Jan. 17, airlines chief executives warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment.
Hours before the planned Jan. 19 deployment, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying about 510 5G wireless towers near airports.
The delay did not prevent dozens of countries from canceling flights to the United States, and it cast the U.S. regulatory system in an ugly light.
""Although some flights have been affected by safety mitigations required in 5G deployment areas, significant disruptions to the air transportation system have been avoided,"" Dickson's testimony says.
House Transportation and Infrastructure committee chairman Peter DeFazio in a written statement released ahead of the hearing said that the recent events show ""the current interagency process for auctioning off spectrum is completely
broken.""
DeFazio said key questions remain, including how long will the wireless carriers keep the towners turned off near airports.
Nick Calio, who heads Airlines for America, says in written testimony 5G issues facing the aviation industry should have been avoided and it will likely take ""years"" to permanently address interference issues.
The FAA has cleared 20 altimeter models and approved 90% of the U.S. commercial fleet for landing in low-visibility approaches in areas with C-Band 5G.
""We acknowledge that some altimeters — especially older models used by certain segments of the aviation industry — may not receive approval as being safe in the presence of 5G emissions and interference, and may need to be replaced,"" Dickson's testimony said.

Reuters reported Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-plans-turn-around-2000-5g-towers-february-sources-2022-02-01 Verizon has won approval to turn on about 14% of the 500 towers it agreed not to deploy near airports. The FAA plans subsequent refinements of the airport buffer zones that will allow further towers to be activated. 
Federal Communications Commission chair Jessica Rosenworcel was invited but unable to testify. She spoke to DeFazio and subcommittee chair Rick Larsen on Wednesday about the issue, her office said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The price of bond market data has risen by half over the past five years, which could prompt some users to quit the market and damage liquidity, industry body AFME said on Thursday.
Big banks and asset managers already say that data on share trades is too expensive -- a complaint rejected by exchanges -- and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) is now also targeting fixed income data costs.
The European Union, keen to deepen its capital market after the departure of Britain from the bloc, has proposed a ""consolidated tape"" which collates and gives access to real time bond and stock trades to increase liquidity and transparency.
Britain has also floated a bond tape plan, but a tape itself will not solve the fundamental issues of data costs, AFME Chief Executive Adam Farkas said in a statement.
""If left unaddressed, some market participants might be forced to scale back their data purchases to a minimum. In some cases, it could also lead to strategic decisions to withdraw from certain markets,"" Farkas said.
The AFME commissioned a report from Expand Research on data prices in fixed income, using information from 10 big market makers, all AFME members, and other sources.
Costs have risen regardless of the number of market users and is driven by prike hikes and changes to charging structures, the report said.
The cost of fixed income data, used by market participants to find the best deals across the market for customers, has gone up faster than for equities data, it said.
(AFME Fixed Income Costs Graphic, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjxqjlpe/AFME%20Fixed%20Income%20Data%20Graphic.PNG) 
Banking sector complaints about share price data have focused on exchanges, but the AFME report said fixed income relies more heavily on non-exchange pricing data from terminals, and research and analytics.

AFME said it wanted standardised pricing models for buying data, uniform storage formats, and consistent procedures for accessing data.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority signalled a shake-up in financial market data in January, citing ""limited competition"".

(Reuters) - All three Wall Street benchmarks ended higher on Wednesday, rising for a fourth straight session after a turbulent start to the year, aided by upbeat earnings from Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
But the mood looked sour in post-market trade when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc shares plunged as much as 22% after it missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.
“It’s a sign of decelerating growth, and people don’t like to see that with growth stocks,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, of the social media giant's results.
Other social media companies also fell hard after the bell, including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), which also released disappointing results late Wednesday.
Nasdaq futures tumbled 1.8% and S&P 500 futures lost 0.7%, signaling traders expect Wall Street to fall on Thursday. 
During the regular session, Alphabet rose 7.5% after reporting record quarterly sales on Tuesday, and said it plans to undertake a 20-to-one stock split - a move which Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said should make it more appealing to retail investors.
Meta had risen slightly before its results, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dipped 0.4% ahead of its earnings report due on Thursday.
Last month, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell as much as 19% from its all-time high in November as investors dumped highly valued growth stocks on prospects of faster-than-expected rate hikes.
Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year after hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve in January.
""There's a huge portion of the tech market, and the growth market, that is commanding fairly extreme multiples, which probably needs a little air taken out of the tires,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, adding such a move was ""healthy"".
An exception to this, he argued, would be the biggest five or six technology names, given their more modest valuations and better fundamentals.
Tech earnings provide an opportunity for this to happen, with ripple effects being felt by peers.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 5.1% after the company on Tuesday forecast 2022 revenue above expectations, following strong quarterly demand for its semiconductors, despite global supply snags.
The positive sentiment extended to other chipmakers including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which advanced between 2.5% and 6.3%.
However,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) slumped 24.6% after it forecast first-quarter revenue and profit well below expectations.
Other financial technology and payments firms were dragged down as a result, with Block Inc, Affirm Holdings Inc and SoFi Technologies falling between 8.4% and 10.6%.
Overall, the only major S&P sector that ended lower was consumer discretionary, which dipped 0.5%. Communication services led gainers, on the back of Alphabet's performance. It was also aided by  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH), which rose 5.3% as investors picked up the Tinder owner on a belief that the Omicron variant would not impact its business as much as previously feared.
Only consumer discretionary was lower, down xx%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 224.09 points, or 0.63%, to 35,629.33, the S&P 500 gained 42.84 points, or 0.94%, to 4,589.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 71.54 points, or 0.5%, to 14,417.55.
Markets in 2022 have been choppy, as investors seek to position themselves for rising rates to tackle inflation, as well as lingering pandemic influences on the economy and geopolitical tension in Europe.
""The markets are trying to piece all this together,"" said Pride. ""It almost feels like a 'deer-in-headlights' effect right now, where there are too many cross-currents to try and triangulate quickly.""
He added the market is likely to bounce around for the immediate future, as investors digest these various inputs.
An unexpected decline in private payrolls on Wednesday helped keep U.S. Treasury yields stable as investors weighed its potential impact on Friday's broader jobs report.
Banks including  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) lost ground, falling between 0.1% and 0.8%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.06 billion shares, compared with the 12.43 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 67 new lows.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 07:10PM ET</span>","White House, EPA urge US Postal Service to reconsider gas-powered vehicle plan","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday urged the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to reconsider its plan to buy a new multibillion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles.
The EPA sent a letter to the USPS on Wednesday urging it to hold a new hearing on its 10-year contract with Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp that could be worth $6 billion or more to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
White House Council on Environmental Quality chair Brenda Mallory said in a letter https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USPS_letter_02022022.pdf the EPA ""has communicated grave concerns with the adequacy of the environmental review that the USPS has conducted to date."" She urged USPS to complete a supplemental environmental impact statement.
USPS said it would review the EPA's concerns but believes it is in compliance with environemntal review requirements.
""While we can understand why some who are not responsible for the financial sustainability of the Postal Service might prefer that we acquire more electric vehicles, the law requires us to be self-sufficient,"" USPS said in a statement, adding it is ""willing to accelerate the pace of electrification of our delivery fleet if a solution can be found to do so that is not financially detrimental to the Postal Service.""
USPS awarded a $482 million contract to Oshkosh's defense unit, which will make the next-generation vehicles, in February 2021 that could ultimately be worth $6 billion. Oshkosh did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy previously told lawmakers the agency was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet as part of its multibillion-dollar plan to retire its 30-year-old delivery vehicles.
The EPA said USPS's proposed new gas-powered vehicles ""are expected to achieve only 8.6 miles per gallon (mpg), barely improving over the decades-old long-life vehicles that 
achieve 8.2 mpg.""
EPA said greenhouse gas emissions from the gas vehicles ""will total nearly 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide"" over 20 years and the present value of the climate damage from these emissions would exceed $900 million.
EPA wants USPS to first purchase the ""full minimum committed"" EV volume before buying new gas-powered vehicles and also purchase commercially available electric vehicles for some routes.
The Sierra Club praised the Biden administration effort. ""Shifting to a 100% electric Postal Service is a no-brainer. Electric mail trucks will reduce noise, air, and climate pollution in communities across the nation, while slashing fueling costs,"" the environmental group said.
Biden's spending and climate bill would award $6 billion for USPS to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. With the funding, USPS has said all delivery fleet acquisitions could feasibly be electric by 2028, and a corresponding 70% of the entire delivery fleet could be EVs by 2030.
Mallory wrote on Wednesday the White House supports USPS ""using its existing resources, including its significant cash reserve or through a credit strategy, to invest in our nation's health, environment and competitiveness.""
The contract allows for delivery of between 50,000 and 165,000 of the vehicles over 10 years.

The USPS rejected a proposal from electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group Inc.
DeJoy said last year USPS had agreed to spend $500 million on the next-generation vehicles to make them convertible to EVs from internal-combustion models at a future date.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) of misleading consumers about how resistant its iPhones are to water exposure.
Apple's advertisements had made various claims about the iPhone's resistance to damage when submerged or otherwise exposed to water, including that some models could survive depths of 4 meters (13.1 feet) for 30 minutes.
The named plaintiffs, two from New York and one from South Carolina, claimed that Apple's ""false and misleading"" misrepresentations let the company charge twice as much for iPhones than the cost of ""average smartphones.""
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan said the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that Apple's ads could mislead consumers, but did not show their iPhones were damaged by ""liquid contact"" Apple promised they could withstand.
The judge also found no proof of fraud, citing a lack of evidence that Apple intended to overstate its water resistance claims, or that the plaintiffs relied on fraudulent marketing statements when buying their iPhones.
Spencer Sheehan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients are disappointed with the decision, and no decision has been made whether to appeal.
Neither Apple nor lawyers for the Cupertino, California-based company immediately responded to requests for comment.

In the quarter ended Dec. 25, 2021, iPhones accounted for $71.6 billion, or 58%, of Apple's $123.9 billion of net sales.
The case is Smith et al v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-03657.

(Reuters) -Qualcomm Inc posted record first-quarter revenue on Wednesday and beat Wall Street forecasts for the current quarter, boosted by strong growth in the Android business and demand from China's handset makers.
The U.S. chips firm forecast second-quarter revenue between $10.2 billion and $11 billion, above analysts' estimates of $9.61 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company has benefited from the exit of Huawei Technologies from the smartphone market, which has led other Chinese phone brands - including Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Honor and Oppo - to turn to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for their chip needs.
""Android is driving the growth,"" Qualcomm chief financial officer Akash Palkhiwala told Reuters. In the first quarter, handset revenues rose 42% year-over-year to $6 billion, driven by greater than 60% growth in revenues from Snapdragon chipsets for Android devices.
The shifting Chinese market had given Qualcomm ""tremendous opportunity... and we're capitalizing on it,"" said Palkhiwala.
He said during an earnings call that the second half of the fiscal 2022 year is ""shaping up"" like the second half of fiscal 2021, with ""very strong year over-year-growth rates.""
Net income in the first quarter rose to $3.69 billion, or $3.23 per share, from $2.51 billion, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier. Palkhiwala forecasted over 30% of non-GAAP EPS growth in the third quarter.
Still, Qualcomm shares fell about 3% in after hours trading as the results were overshadowed by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta's weaker-than-expected profit and forecast.
""We think investors are somewhat concerned about possible demand pull-in and/or double ordering by its (Qualcomm's) customers due to the industry supply constraint,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group.

While chip supply constraints that have crippled many industries during the pandemic continue, chief executive Cristiano Amon told the earnings call that Qualcomm has invested to make sure it is able to deliver to its customers and that supply will improve in the second half of 2022. 
Revenue in the first quarter was $10.7 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $10.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Its chip segment had first-quarter revenue of $8.85 billion, above analyst expectations of $8.69 billion, according to data from FactSet.

Companies in the sector are growing more confident that travel will return despite on-and-off restrictions in response to the Omicron variant of COVID-19. 
""Despite the Omicron variant, forward bookings are strong for upcoming peak leisure travel periods,"" Chief Executive Officer Maurice Gallagher said in a statement, adding that spring break bookings have been particularly robust.
Allegiant's operations were earlier hampered by crew shortages due to Omicron's spread, but Gallagher said he expects that to normalize in time for peak travel in March.
""Case counts have started to recede, thus the worst should be behind us,"" he said. 
Larger carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines have also said that a recovery in passenger traffic was likely in March. 
In the fourth quarter, Allegiant doubled its revenue to $496.9 million, higher than analysts' average estimate of $482.3 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net income came in at $10.7 million, or 59 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $28.8 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major airlines, business and travel groups urged the White House on Wednesday to end COVID-19 pre-departure testing requirements for vaccinated international passengers traveling to the United States.
Airlines for America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, International Air Transport Association, Aerospace Industries Association, the U.S. Travel Association and other groups called for change in a letter to White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients.
""Surveys of air passengers indicate that pre-departure testing is a leading factor in the decision not to travel internationally. People simply are unwilling to take the chance that they will be unable to return to the U.S.,"" they wrote.
The White House declined to comment. Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and others said as of last week international air travel was down 38% over 2019 levels.
In December, the Biden administration imposed tougher new rules requiring international air travelers arriving in the United States to obtain a negative COVID-19 test within one day of travel.
Under prior rules, vaccinated international air travelers could present a negative test result obtained within three days of their day of departure. 
The White House and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) previously considered but have never imposed testing requirements for Americans to board domestic flights.
The letter noted that more than 74.3 million people have had COVID-19 in the United States, meaning that at least 22% of the population has had the virus.
""Clearly COVID is widespread throughout the U.S. and attempts to control its importation via air travel under today’s circumstances are unlikely to change that fact,"" it said.
If any new threatening variants appeared ""pre-departure testing could be easily reinstituted,"" it added.

The European Union recommended countries remove intra-Europe COVID travel restrictions, the letter noted. Britain will end COVID predeparture testing for vaccinated air travelers to enter the country starting Feb. 11.
The groups said ""travel and aviation’s recovery is dependent on the government taking steps to remove travel restrictions that are no longer justified by current circumstances.""

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc's quarterly earnings miss and poor forecast on Wednesday ignited a meltdown in social media stocks and threatened to smother a recent recovery from a Wall Street tech selloff.
Meta tumbled 21% following its quarterly report after the bell, erasing about $200 billion worth of its stock market value. A decline of this size in Thursday's session would mark the company's worst one-day loss since its Wall Street debut in 2012.
The owner of Facebook and Instagram said it was expecting current-quarter revenue between $27 billion and $29 billion, missing the consensus analyst estimate of about $30 billion.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc each tumbled about 10%, zapping over $4 billion in market capitalization.  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) slumped 18%, losing $9 billion in stock market value. 
""This is a very unforgiving environment and this is likely an over-reaction for companies with strong balance sheets. But we are seeing clearly that investors are skittish and they will hit the sell button first and ask questions later,"" said Michael Farr, chief executive of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC.
The rout reached beyond social media, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) down 3% in extended trade ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc dropped 1.9%, surrendering part of a 7.5% rally it enjoyed earlier in the day following its blowout quarterly report on Tuesday.
Short interest in Meta ahead of Wednesday's report was almost $8 billion, equivalent to 1% of the company's float, suggesting short sellers, according to data from S3 Partners.
Nasdaq futures dropped 1.8%, signaling investors expect a decline when Nasdaq trading begins on Thursday. 
""It’s a sign of decelerating growth, and people don’t like to see that with growth stocks,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The Nasdaq in recent sessions has bounced back from its worst January since 2009. Concerned about rising interest rates, investors had been selling technology and other growth stocks for months. 
The Nasdaq remains down about 10% from its record high close in November. At its latest price of about $253 late on Wednesday, Meta was down about 34% from its September record high close.

STOCKHOLM/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Spotify on Wednesday forecast current quarter subscribers lower than Wall Street expectations, but executives sought to reassure investors that growth had not cratered even as it deals with the fallout from the controversy around The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. 
The company's shares fell as much as 18% in late trading after Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) reported the subscriber outlook.
In an interview with Reuters after the report, Spotify Chief Financial Officer Paul Vogel said this year's growth rate would not be that much different than last in terms of users and subscribers. 
""While we have not given full year guidance anymore on subscribers ... we don't expect a material difference in the net additions for either users or subscribers in 2022 relative to 2021,"" Vogel told Reuters.
Shares pared losses and were down between 3% to 9% after the initial shock.
The outlook overshadowed fourth-quarter revenue, which came in higher than analysts' estimates, as the music streaming company sold more advertisements and newer services such as podcasts, while recording a healthy 16% increase in paid subscribers for its premium service.
Total monthly active users rose 18% to a record 406 million.
The company, however, forecast current-quarter paid subscribers of 183 million, below expectations of 184 million. Revenue is expected to meet estimates of 2.60 billion euros.
Spotify said it would no longer offer annual guidance on subscribers.
""While investors are clearly disappointed in the first quarter gross margin trajectory, the real story is ad revenue growing at nearly double the rate of their subscription business and that's where we believe the meaningful upside is over the course of the next several years,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. 
The subscription music streaming service has invested over a $1 billion in the podcasting business, led by marquee exclusive shows such as The Joe Rogan Experience. 
But the allure of the podcast star also drew condemnation after his show aired controversial views around COVID-19, drawing protests from artists Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.
Rogan, a popular internet commentator, has since apologized and Spotify said it would start adding content advisories to episodes discussing COVID.
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said the company already has a ""sizable"" content moderation team in place.
""We have taken action on more than 20,000 podcasts since the start of the pandemic,"" Ek told Reuters. ""So that tells you something about the scale of this operation. It's truly a global operation.""
Ek acknowledged the Rogan controversy at the outset of the earnings conference call, saying it presented learning opportunities. He said he was proud of the steps Spotify took following the concerns raised by the medical and scientific communities and he says policies were developed with input from internal and external exports.
""While Joe has a massive audience, he's actually the number 1 podcast in more than 90 markets, he also has to abide by those policies,"" Ek said.
Spotify said podcast's share of overall consumption hours on its platform reached an all-time high and it expanded its paid podcast subscriptions in 33 more markets and enabled podcasts for users in Russia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Premium subscribers, which account for most of the company's revenue, rose to 180 million, beating analysts' expectations of 179.9 million.
Quarterly revenue rose to 2.69 billion euros ($3.04 billion) from 2.17 billion a year earlier, and above the 2.65 billion euros expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue from users who hear advertisements rose 40% to 394 million euros or 15% of total revenue.
""Investors largely ignored Spotify's advertising business during Spotify's first few years as a public company, with subscriber growth dominating the narrative,"" Greenfield said earlier in a note.
""As Spotify moved from a music platform to an audio platform (podcasting, live audio, audiobooks), it has unlocked the potential for a robust advertising business that is now too large for investors to ignore.""
Spotify ventured into podcasts in 2018 with a series of acquisitions to compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Since then it has launched a paid subscription platform for podcasters in the U.S., opened it up for advertising, and became the largest podcaster dethroning Apple.

Unlike the music business, which is largely commoditized and low margin as it pays out a part of the revenue to the rights holders, podcasts engage listeners for hours on end, creating valuable advertising inventory that has underpinned the optimism by Wall Street over its long term future.

Sales of the company's crop-protection products rose 6% in the quarter led by its herbicides, Enlist and Arylex, and Isoclast insecticide, while strong demand for corn in Latin America and higher volumes boosted its seed segment sales by 12%.
""Global agriculture fundamentals remain strong going into 2022, and we expect demand across the industry to remain resilient despite other macro challenges,"" chief executive Chuck Magro said.
The company, spun off in 2019 after a merger of Dow Chemical and Dupont, said it expected net sales of $16.7 billion to $17 billion for the year 2022, above estimates of $16.62 billion.
 Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) forecast operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Analysts expected the company to post core earnings of $2.98 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Corteva's shares were down as much as 5.46% at $45.5 in extended trading. 
The Wilmington, Delaware-based company's net sales rose 8.48% to $3.48 billion in the fourth quarter, which were slightly above market estimates of $3.46 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The company's operating earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter stood at $262 million, or 8 cents per share, missing analysts' estimate of 9 cents
Corteva named ex-Nutrien head Chuck Magro as its chief executive officer in November, after its previous CEO retired amid activist investor Starboard Value's push to oust him.

TORONTO, BOSTON (Reuters) -Stock-picking hedge funds ended a volatile January with losses after markets went on a roller-coaster ride on geopolitical turmoil and the prospect of rising interest rates, but market participants say the performance has not dampened demand.
Equities hedge funds lost 6.22% in January, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reviewed by Reuters, a steeper decline than the 5.23% loss on Wall Street's S&P 500 benchmark, while health-care and technology-focused strategies slid more than 10%. Goldman confirmed the figures in the note. 
While hedge funds that take long and short positions struggled in January, investor appetite for the strategy is still going strong, said market participants.
""For long-short equity, a lot of managers are in the red but now that they have printed month-end, we did see a little bit of a rally back from where they were earlier in the month,"" said Joshua Leonardi, U.S. Head of Capital Introduction at TD Securities.
""Allocators continue to ask for managers that have strong ability to short single names and can generate alpha.""
Billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings lost 8.2% in January, tumbling early in the month and then clawing back returns in the last week.
The Pershing Square Holdings portfolio ended the first three weeks of January down 13.8%, the worst performance to start a year for Ackman in years.
However, Pershing Square Holdings lost 1.3% in both January 2021 and January 2020 after making gains of 18.3% in the first month of 2019.
Tiger Global Management's hedge fund lost 14.8% in January while Whale Rock Capital Management's hedge fund lost 15.9% over the same period in its share class that invests in public and private companies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Melvin Capital Management and Light Street Capital Management lost 15% last month, according to sources familiar with the firms. A spokesperson for Light Street declined to comment. A spokesperson for Melvin also declined to comment.
Balyasny Asset Management, which manages $14 billion in assets, gained 2.4% over the same period, an investor told Reuters.
A spokesperson for Balyasny declined to comment.

Computer-based hedge funds landed in positive territory in the first month of the year, posting returns of 5.3%, said the note from Goldman.

1064,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 05:15PM ET</span>",Amazon and Snap Earnings as Tech's Latest Hope - 3 Things to Watch,"by Daniel Shvartsman
Investing.com - Wednesday trading saw the market continue its recovery from the volatile start to the trading year, with the S&P 500 finishing up nearly 1% and the Nasdaq up .5%. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s knock-out report the prior evening gave the market hope that the tech sector's outsized growth had legs left to it in the emerging post-pandemic environment.
That flipped after-hours on Wednesday, as Meta Platforms' (nee Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)) report missed numbers and offered a meager 3-11% revenue growth guidance for Q1. The miss and weak guidance sent shares down over 20%, with knock-on effects to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) (down 9%), Snap (NYSE:SNAP) (down 17%), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) (down 9.5%). And the pain in tech wasn't confined to social media: Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) also dropped 12% after an underwhelming Q1 guidance, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was off 2% as of this writing despite a beat-and-raise.
All of which sets the table for an interesting Thursday of earnings, with the last of the FAANG group to report earnings as well as another social media play and several important industrial companies reporting.
Here are three things to watch in markets tomorrow:
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been the lagging mega-tech company, with its most recent earnings report already reflected the hangover from the pandemic-fueled growth surge of 2020. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is expected to post $137.75B in revenue, which would be 9.7% above 2020's number. They are also expected to guide to $121B in revenue for Q1 2022, which would mark 12% growth over the year prior. Having digested their growth slowdown already - shares are flat since July 2020 when counting that the stock is down 3.5% in the wake of Meta's report - the question is what's priced in and if Amazon is at the reacceleration point yet.
Snap, meanwhile, also reports after the bell, with analysts expecting $1.2B in revenue, good for 31% growth, as well as guidance for of roughly $1B in Q1 revenue, also good for 31% year over year growth (Snap is still expected to post earnings losses). Shares are off 69% from 52-week highs as Snap has already reported the IDFA headwinds that Meta touched on in their Q1 guidance, but that doesn't mean a miss would be received kindly.
Several major industrial, medical, or energy players report earnings before the bell. With tech showing signs of slowing as pandemic-related tailwinds fade, these earnings will give a snapshot into the industrial side of the economy as well as more direct supply chain and inflation readthroughs.
Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW),  Roche Holding Ltd  ADR (OTC:RHHBY), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Merck & Co, Shell (LON:RDSa), Cummins (NYSE:CMI), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Cigna (NYSE:CI) are all among the reporters before the bell tomorrow.

While jobless claims have drifted towards 50-year lows in recent months, the numbers have been elevated over the last three weeks, perhaps a reflection of Omicron related slowdowns. With today's ADP jobs number surprising to the downside with a meaningful drop in payrolls, tomorrow's report could be a last key data point before the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, and also closely watched amid expectations of Federal Reserve rate hikes in March.

Investing.com – The euro continued its strong start to the week against the dollar as rampant inflation data buoyed expectations for sooner rate hikes, but the European Central Bank is likley to pour cold water on rate hike bets in its monetary policy update due Thursday.
EUR/USD climbed 0.34% to $1.1307.
“Today's flash estimate of euro area inflation in January smashed all expectations to increase somewhat the probability that the ECB might raise rates as soon as this year,” Daiwa Capital Markets said ahead of the central bank’s meeting.
But market participants aren’t so sure that fresh signs of inflation pressures will spur a change in tone from ECB governor Christine Lagarde, who has repeatedly said that a patient approach is needed to tightened monetary policy.
“[W]e think that patience will prevail over panic in the ECB’s message when it comes to inflation, and given the bar for a hawkish surprise is placed quite high after this week’s consumer price index figures, we expect EUR/USD to give up some of its recent gains after the ECB announcement,” ING said in a note.
Still, market participants are set for fresh clues on how strong the ECB's resolve is to stick with its current monetary policy stance as Lagarde will be peppered with questions on when teh central bank plans to get rate hikes underway as inflation is nearing the cental bank's 2% target. 
“[I]t is perfectly feasible that the updated forecasts will nudge up these figures to 2.0%Y/Y or so, suggesting that the conditions required for rate lift-off might now be met,” Daiwa added."
1067,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Nubank sees Brazil downturn as a chance to grow faster -CEO,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's economic downturn may represent an opportunity for Latin America's newest listed lender to gain market share aggressively despite the riskier environment, the founder and CEO of digital bank Nubank, David Velez, said.
The fintech debuted on the New York Stock Exchange less than two months ago as Latin America's most valuable financial institution, worth $52 billion. Although its shares have taken a hit since then, Velez said the company - whose 48 million clients make it one of the world's largest digital banks and which recently expanded in Mexico - is well-positioned for growth.
Velez said he expects the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to rise this year as Brazilian consumers struggle with high inflation, rising interest rates and a sluggish economy.
But he sees Nubank keeping its NPL ratios below the market average due to its advanced use of data for underwriting policies. Nubank's 90-day default ratio for credit cards is 3.3%, compared with the industry average of 4.8%.
The riskier outlook may even present an opportunity for faster growth at Nubank, Velez added in a video interview with Reuters on Tuesday. Funded with retail deposits, Nubank does not depend on credit markets and has a large cash position since its $2.6 billion initial public offering (IPO) in December.
""We might have actually have an opportunity to accelerate and take even more [market] share and leave interest rates even lower to make our products much more competitive,"" Velez said. The short duration of the bank's credit portfolio - six weeks for credit card loans and four to six months for personal credit - also allows better risk assessment, he said. 
Expanding Nubank's credit portfolio is seen by analysts as the key to reaching profitability. According to estimates by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a recent report, Nubank obtains less than 200 reais ($37.67) in annual revenue from each active client, whereas its largest rival, Itau Unibanco Holding, gets more than 1,200 reais.
The most profitable credit products for retail banks are mortgages, followed by payroll loans and personal loans, according to Morgan Stanley. 
Nubank is looking at ways to start offering payroll loans, and also plans to expand home equity and auto equity credit lines offered by partner Creditas to its clients. 
ROLLER-COASTER DEBUT
Velez said he was not surprised that Nubank's U.S.-listed shares have retreated by more than 20% since their stock market debut on Dec. 9, given the broader rout in technology stocks.
""We have been telling investors to expect volatility. Brazil and Latin America are volatile,"" he said.
The recent selloff has dragged Nubank's market capitalization below that of mammoth Brazilian banks Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA.
Velez said a rise in interest rates in the United States and Brazil will affect Nubank stock in the short term, but the longer-term growth trend will not be impacted as customers look for more inexpensive financial services.
Nubank has grown through two recessions, a presidential impeachment and the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, Velez added.
Another channel for boosting revenue is to sell customers more investment products through its broker Nu Invest, the result of acquiring broker Easynvest in September 2020. 
Nubank is also expanding services for clients in its app, offering e-commerce, gaming and insurance mostly through partners in which the digital bank has a stake through its venture capital fund. 
BRICKS AND MORTAR
A fierce defender of purely digital banking, Velez concedes that Nubank will need to consider some kind of physical presence in the future to serve specific clients.
""Eventually, if we want to go through on certain segments, we might need to consider having some kind of offline presence to be able to serve our customers better,"" he said, citing high net worth individuals and clients shopping for mortgages.
The fintech might even consider a partnership with a brick-and-mortar bank to offer mortgages, Velez added. ""We would be very happy to partner with any of the large traditional banks.""
Closer on the horizon, Nubank is preparing to launch checking accounts in Mexico this year, after it received regulatory approval for its acquisition of local lender Akala.
The growth of the Mexican operation has been a pleasant surprise, Velez said, making Nubank the country's largest credit card issuer of new cards issued monthly, with 760,000 clients. 
Mexico has lower financial penetration rates and less competition than Brazil, he added.

The bank's expansion in the CEO's native Colombia will take longer, he said, as Nubank is still in the early stages of obtaining its operating licenses.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 04:45PM ET</span>","Alphabet stock split may trigger retail buying, Dow inclusion","By Lewis Krauskopf and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's 20-for-1 stock split puts it on course to follow other major companies that have executed similar moves in recent years.
The Google parent's share price soared 7.5% on Wednesday after it reported record quarterly sales along with the share split.
Other megacap peers that have undertaken stock splits since 2020 include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
(Graphic: Alphabet shares versus rival megacaps, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnejxdrpl/Pasted%20image%201643820200973.png) 
Between 2017 and 2021, S&P 500 companies executed 26 stock splits, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Though a company may decide to split its stock for various reasons, a cheaper price may make the shares more appealing to some investors, analysts said.
Peng Cheng, head of machine learning strategies at JP Morgan, said stock splits in general have a ""psychological effect.""
""One would much rather spend $100 and own 100 shares, than to own 0.1 share,"" Cheng said. ""We observe lower retail participation in high-priced stocks than low-priced stocks.""
Retail buying surged in the wake of both the Apple and Tesla stock split announcements, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said. When Apple announced its 4-for-1 split in July 2020, retail investors went from purchasing less than $150 million in Apple stock each week to nearly $1 billion, according to Vanda.
After Tesla's 5-for-1 split announcement in August 2020, retail buying jumped from $30 million-$40 million per week pre-announcement to over $700 million a few weeks later.
""Alphabet’s announcement will almost certainly end up increasing retail investors’ activity in the stock,"" Vanda analysts said in emailed comments to Reuters.
Aside from Alphabet, there are another 27 stocks in the S&P 500 with share prices above $500, notes Bespoke Investment Group. However, stocks splits have become ""less and less common"" over the past 20 years, according to Bespoke. 
From 2001 to 2007, the median number of S&P 500 stock splits was 35 in a year, according to Bespoke. From 2008 through last year, that number is down to only nine.
For Alphabet, analysts said the stock split could pave the way for its addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. By reducing its stock price from roughly $3,000 now to $150 a share, Alphabet would make its stock more palatable for the 30-member Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that high-priced stocks have an outsized influence.
""A 20:1 stock split may bring more retail investors into the stock and could help set the stage for inclusion into the DJIA,"" UBS analysts said in a research note.
Changes to the blue-chip Dow industrials are made on an ""as-needed"" basis and can be made at any time ""in response to corporate actions and market developments,"" according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors,"" according to a methodology document for the Dow Jones averages that also said stock price is a factor when considering a company for inclusion.
Alphabet's share rise on Wednesday lifted its market value near $2 trillion, which would put it in elite company with Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Because Alphabet alone has a greater-than-4% weight in the benchmark S&P 500 and well over 7% weight in the Nasdaq, its climb on Wednesday helped support those indexes, which in January posted their biggest monthly drops since March 2020.

Investing.com —  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) announced earnings per share of -€0.21 on revenue of €2.69 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of -€0.51 on revenue of €2.65 billion.
Spotify's total monthly active (MAUs) users grew 18% year-over-year to 406 million in the quarter, up from 381 million last quarter, near the top end of the company's guidance range. In addition, the music streaming company said it saw double-digit year-on-year growth in all regions, with strong results in India and Indonesia. 
Premium subscribers grew 16% year-over-year to 180 million in Q4, up from 172 million last quarter and near the top end of the guidance range.
Furthermore, the company said it generated a double-digit increase in the number of monthly active users engaged with its podcast content compared to Q3. As a result, the podcast share of overall consumption hours on its platform reached another all-time high, said Spotify.
In Q1 2022, the company expects a total of MAUs of 418 million, with premium subscribers coming in at 183 million and revenue being €2.60 billion. The revenue outlook meets expectations, but the subscriber number is lower than analysts expected and that revenue number may be drawing suspicion as Spotify noted that ""360 bps"" of year over year growth come from currency tailwinds. The number would mark 21% year over year growth.
Following the report, Spotify shares dropped as much as 17% after-hours, following a 5.75% fall in the regular session. They are currently trading just below $160/share, which would set a new 52-week low and put shares back where they were before Spotify announced the exclusive licensing of Joe Rogan's market-leading podcast. Rogan has drawn fire over recent weeks for COVID-19 views and comments, with the blowback weighing on Spotify's reputation and leading the company to issue a content policy over the weekend."

Meta Platforms parent company Facebook slumped more than 20% in after-hours trade following the report.

Impressions is set to take a hit from increasing competition, and increasing popularity of its video surfaces like Reels will take growth away from its higher margin segments like feed and stories.
Commenting on price headwinds, Meta flagged Apple's iOS privacy changes as another headwind to growth at a time when rising costs are impacting advertiser budgets.

The U.S. insurer reported an adjusted profit of $2.17 per share, compared with $2.03 a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.47, according to Refinitiv data.
New York-based MetLife's net investment income jumped 7% on an adjusted basis to $5.2 billion, bolstered by higher returns from its private equity investments. 
Insurance providers worldwide have recorded rising investment returns over the past year as markets continue to rebound from a pandemic-induced slump, helping offset a jump in claim payouts related to the coronavirus crisis.
Vaccine rollouts were expected to ease the burden for insurers, but the highly infectious Delta variant ratcheted up COVID-related claims to $5.5 billion in the first nine months of last year, far higher than the total for all of 2020.
Insurers reported higher COVID-related fatalities last year than in 2020, when the deaths were mainly among older people who typically do not take out life insurance. 
The company's group benefits unit saw a 95% slump in earnings in the quarter, hurt by unfavorable group life underwriting as a result of COVID-19.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 04:26PM ET</span>",CNN's Jeff Zucker resigns for not disclosing relationship with colleague,"By Helen Coster and Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - CNN President Jeff Zucker, whom industry insiders speculated would play a larger role when the network becomes part of Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), resigned on Wednesday, telling staff he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague.
Zucker, 56, said in a memo that his relationship came to light during the network’s investigation into the conduct of Chris Cuomo, a primetime CNN anchor who was fired in December for assisting his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was accused of sexual misconduct.
Andrew Cuomo has said his accusers had misinterpreted his words, gestures and demeanor.
""I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't,"" Zucker, who also stepped down from his role as chairman of WarnerMedia's news and sports division, wrote in the memo. 
Zucker, through a spokesperson, declined an interview request. He is divorced, his representative said.
He did not name his colleague in the memo, but the relationship was with Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer for the network, CNN anchor Brian Stelter said during a broadcast Wednesday, adding she was remaining at CNN.
""Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,” Stelter quoted Gollust as saying in a separate memo of her own issued on Wednesday. “Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn't disclose it at the right time. I'm incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.”
Gollust did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CNN is part of AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, which is being spun off in a $43 billion transaction 1 with Discovery. 
Although Zucker had indicated he planned to retire from CNN, he was expected to play a prominent role in the new Warner Bros Discovery. Zucker and Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav, who will lead Warner Bros Discovery, are former colleagues and friends. 
WarnerMedia is planning to launch a new subscription streaming video news service, CNN+, in the first quarter of 2022. Zaslav has publicly committed to CNN after the deal closes and said that the combined entity will “lean into news.”
Discovery declined to comment on Zucker's resignation.
In a memo to staff, WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar wrote he accepted Zucker's resignation and would announce an interim leadership plan shortly. 
""People are very shocked,"" said a former CNN staffer Wednesday. ""Jeff is like the glue for a lot of people throughout the pandemic.”

Zucker, who joined CNN in 2013, has a storied reputation in the TV business marked by early success. He was the executive producer of NBC’s “Today” show in his 20s, then became the president of NBC Entertainment.
Born and raised in Miami, Zucker has four children and resides in New York City, according to a profile on CNN's website.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 03:51PM ET</span>","Autonomous vehicles need stricter rules -U.S. safety group, labor unions","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor unions and a consumer safety advocate on Wednesday urged the Biden administration to add more safeguards to ensure autonomous vehicles are safe before being deployed in wide numbers on U.S. roads.
Lawmakers at a U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing raised concerns about self-driving vehicles but also said the technology could help prevent tens of thousands of road deaths.
""We need to know what's happening on our roads, and the way to accomplish safety is through regulation,"" said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, in arguing for minimum performance standards.
Ariel Wolf, general counsel for industry group the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, told lawmakers ""autonomous vehicles are not only safe but they are making our roads safer. There is a crisis on our roadways."" The AVIA represents Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s self-driving Cruise unit and others.
Traffic deaths in the first nine months of 2021 were the highest since 2006, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday.
Legislation to speed the deployment of self-driving vehicles and ease hurdles has been stalled for years and shows no sign of moving. U.S. safety regulators are also investigating a number of crashes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's driver assistance system, Autopilot. Tesla has said its systems are safe.
Under pressure from regulators, Tesla on Tuesday agreed to disable a feature from its ""Full Self-Driving"" (Beta) feature that allowed vehicles to drive through a stop sign without coming to a complete stop, at low speeds. Representative Hank Johnson criticized Tesla's feature at Wednesday's hearing.
Teamsters official Doug Bloch told the committee that ""all workers deserve to know that an autonomous vehicle or bot traveling next to them is safe enough to share the same road or worksite.""
John Samuelsen, who heads the Transport Workers Union of America, told lawmakers the United States must ""establish and enforce vigorous safety standards"" on autonomous vehicles.
""AV technologies that haven’t been properly evaluated and scrutinized by independent federal safety regulators, technologies that attempt to cut corners to address their own limitations, and technologies that are intentionally designed to displace workers should all be suspect,"" Samuelsen added.
There are over 1,400 automated vehicles currently in testing by more than 80 companies across 36 states, said U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the full committee.

""In order to reap the safety benefits of AVs, regulators must do their part to hold industry accountable in this process and ensure that AVs deliver on their promise of safer roads,"" DeFazio said. ""We know what can happen when regulators let industry go unchecked ... We cannot cut corners in the name of expediency or convenience.""
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether self-driving vehicles could imperil jobs.

The plant, a joint venture with China's Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co (JAC) first announced in 2019, is set to produce 300,000 electric cars a year, with production starting in 2023.
Together with production from two further joint venture plants - one with FAW Group, and one with SAIC Motor - this should bring total capacity to the 1 million mark, Brandstaetter said. 
Volkswagen was not immediately available for comment. 
The German automaker sold 70,625 of its ID electric vehicles in China last year, missing its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 cars, with production also affected by regional COVID-19 outbreaks in addition to chip-related issues. 
Volkswagen’s China chief Stephan Wollenstein told a briefing in Beijing in January https://www.reuters.com/technology/volkswagen-says-it-sold-70625-id-electric-cars-china-2021-2022-01-11 that the automaker would like to double sales of its ID battery electric vehicles this year but cautioned that low semiconductor supplies could hamper its efforts.
Brandstaetter is due to take over Volkswagen's China business from Aug. 1. 

Under his watch, the carmaker will ramp up local development in China, Brandstaetter told Nikkei. 
""In the past, our approach was to develop in Germany and localize in China,"" he was quoted as saying. ""But this approach will be changed significantly by setting up more local resources for R&D, especially for software, to be faster, to be more independent in China.""

MADRID/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Struggling wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa on Wednesday named a new chief executive for the second time in less than two years, more than 10 days after issuing the latest in a series of profit warnings.
Jochen Eickholt, management board member of Siemens Gamesa's German parent Siemens Energy, will take over from Andreas Nauen as CEO on March 1, the group said, in a move aimed at exerting more direct control over the stricken division.
""Siemens Gamesa is experiencing significant challenges in its onshore business in a very difficult market,"" Siemens Gamesa Chairman Miguel Angel Lopez said.
Frankfurt-listed shares in Siemens Gamesa, the world's largest maker of offshore wind turbines, were up 2.1% after the news.
Siemens Gamesa cut its profit outlook for the third time in nine months in January, dragging down shares in rivals and prompting Siemens Energy to step up plans to buy the 33% stake it does not already own.
Nauen formerly headed the successful offshore wind business and was appointed in 2020 to replace Markus Tacke, who himself served three years in the role after the 2017 merger between Spain's Gamesa and what was then the wind business of Germany's Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY).
Eickholt is currently Siemens Energy's board member responsible for Power Generation and Industrial Applications, as well as Asia-Pacific and China, Siemens Gamesa said in a statement. He has worked at Siemens for more than 20 years.

""As the majority shareholder we support a new start in ... leadership. Jochen has a long and proven track record turning around businesses in challenging situations and I wish him all the best in his new role,"" Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.
As part of the reshuffle Eickholt will leave Siemens Energy's management board, the company said, adding it would soon appoint a successor.

Revenue grew 24% year on year, with Tinder's revenue increasing 23%, an acceleration from the prior quarter, and other brands under the banner seeing a 26% year-over-year rise.
Match put the earnings miss down to continuing Covid impacts, primarily in Asian markets such as Japan.

The airline's move to boost its 737 MAX fleet comes at a time when domestic travel in the United States is staging a recovery, despite the disruption caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said in a filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000000620122000018/aal-20220131.htm that it intends to convert seven more of its purchase options for the MAX this year, bringing its order of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft to 30.
The company has deferred the delivery of Boeing's long-haul 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft that was scheduled to be handed over in January next year. 
Deliveries of aircraft will now begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 and will continue into 2027, with four 787-9 aircraft now scheduled for delivery in 2023, American said.

Investing.com – Stock of Chili’s-owner Brinker (NYSE:EAT) soared more than 10% after the company beat earnings estimates for the second quarter even as revenue fell short.
Brinker earned 71 cents per share on an adjusted basis, 20 cents more than the analysts’ estimate, attributing the growth to “the power of the business model when volumes return”.
“We still have growth ahead of us, and the opportunity to leverage scale and move the business forward,"" Chief Executive Officer and President Wyman Roberts said in a statement.
Revenue in the second quarter grew 22% to nearly $926 million due to higher dining sales at both Chili’s and Maggiano’s as more guests looked to eat out.
The company said sales would have been higher but for Christmas Day that occurred in the second quarter compared to the third quarter of financial year 2021. The company said it shut its Chili's restaurants early on Christmas Eve this year and that also had a little adverse impact.
Higher costs on account of wages, training, overtime and manager bonuses, as well as more expensive commodities, led to a small increase in expenses as a percentage of sales.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 11:37AM ET</span>",Strong orders at Ferrari set to support growth after record 2021,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) -Ferrari has orders stretching into 2023 after delivering a record number of cars last year, Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna said on Wednesday, reflecting a surge in demand for luxury vehicles despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
That demand allowed Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) to predict a rise in its core earnings this year, in the wake of record results in 2021. 
""We have the strongest-ever order book in our history, up double digits versus the prior year and covering well into 2023,"" Vigna told analysts, presenting the annual results after taking charge of the company last September with a task to lead it into a new era of cleaner, quieter and interconnected mobility.
Milan-listed shares in Ferrari reversed early losses and were up 1.4% by 1610 GMT.
Shipments jumped 22% to 11,155 cars last year compared to COVID-hit 2020 and were up 10% from pre-pandemic 2019, the company said.
All regions saw double-digit growth, supported by strong sales of 8-cylinder models, including the F8 family as well as the 205,000-euro ($232,000) Roma grand tourer and the 430,000-euro hybrid SF90 Stradale. Shipments of more powerful but also more polluting 12-cylinder models fell.
Ferrari plans two new models this year, including the much-awaited Purosangue, its first sport utility vehicle (SUV), completing a plan to launch a total of 15 new vehicles it had announced in 2018.
Ferrari, whose 'Prancing Horse' brand is known worldwide for roaring combustion engines, has promised its first all-electric car in 2025, while it has already rolled out three hybrid models.
In a sign of a strong demand worldwide for luxury cars, last year Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), owned by Germany's BMW, saw its sales soar 49% to a record and Porsche, part of Volkwagen, delivered more than 300,000 vehicles, with an increase in all regions.
CORE PROFIT
Ferrari on Wednesday forecast adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.65-1.70 billion euros this year, up from 1.53 billion euros in 2021.
Last year's result was in line with a company-provided forecast of around 1.52 billion euros, and represented a 34% increase on the previous year.
The margin on adjusted EBITDA hit a higher-than-expected record of 35.9% last year. That figure is expected to slip this year to between 34.5%-35.5% the company said.
Following this strong set of results, the company paid all its employees a record performance-linked bonus for 2021 of a gross amount as much as 12,000 euros.
Vigna, a tech industry veteran and former top executive at chip maker STMicroelectronics, will unveil the company's future strategy at a capital markets day on June 16.
He has said that Ferrari would make technology partnerships a priority, as the company moves ahead with its electrification strategy while maintaining financial discipline.

As part of this discipline, Vigna said Ferrari would target capital expenditure of around 800 million euros this year and would seek to keep that as a peak going forward.

Investing.com – Capri Holdings stock (NYSE:CPRI) surged 9% Wednesday after the retailer raised its annual forecast, banking on consumer appetite for luxury shopping staying elevated.
The company, which owns marquee brands like Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo now expects its annual revenue to be around $5.6 billion, revising it from its November guidance of $5.4 billion. Capri has revised its guidance at least twice. Profit per share is seen at $6.
Luxury retailers like LVMH (PA:LVMH) and H&M (ST:HMb) have seen a surge in sales last few months as consumers rush to buy jewelry, watches, bags and shoes, popularly known as ‘revenge shopping’ as they give vent to the frustration of being home for long stretches the last two years.
The company's total revenue rose 24% to $1.6 billion in the third quarter ended December 25, surpassing the pre-pandemic levels. The company said the revenue would have been higher but was constrained by lower on-hand inventory levels. A significant quantity of inventory remains in transit, the company said while closing the quarter with 24% more of it from a year ago.
According to Reuters, Capri is looking to reposition its brands, particularly Versace, at higher price points.
""We've seen absolutely no consumer resistance to any of the price increases that we have taken, and there will be more as well,"" the agency quoted CEO John Idol as telling analysts in a call.
Tight control on costs helped the company improve its operating margin 2.6 percentage points to 22.3%.
Michael Kors, the biggest brand in the stable, grew 20% to $1.2 billion. Versace grew 29% while Jimmy Choo jumped 47% on a smaller base.
Third-quarter adjusted profit per share was $2.22, rising more than 34% due to control on expenses.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 11:25AM ET</span>",Drug distributor McKesson seen getting likely boost from COVID vaccine demand,"By Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) is expected to report strong earnings on Wednesday as an Omicron-driven surge in demand for COVID-19 vaccines and tests is likely to insulate the drug distributor from tepid sales of other medical products.
The unit which sells medical and surgical products contributes about 5% to McKesson's revenue, compared with rival  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH)'s similar business accounting for 10%.
A surge in COVID-19 cases due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant has overwhelmed hospitals, forcing them to turn away patients seeking less-urgent procedures.
McKesson's contract with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to distribute coronavirus vaccines and ancillary supplies has helped it offset any pockets of slower growth tied to volatility in elective surgeries, BofA Securities analyst Michael Cherney said.
(Graphic: COVID-19 impact on Cardinal Health segment revenue growth: https://graphics.reuters.com/MCKESSON-RESULTS/klvykmddlvg/chart.png)
THE CONTEXT
Cardinal Health last month cut the profit forecast for its medical segment, which sells medical, surgical and laboratory products, citing higher costs resulting from global supply chain constraints, and said it was expecting a hit of 40 cents to 45 cents to its adjusted annual earnings.
Given the spike in COVID-19 infections in the last two months, a key area of focus for Cardinal Health will be potential implications for its medical segment, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jailendra Singh, adding that the company's laboratory business can benefit from an increased demand for testing.
McKesson in December raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook by 40 cents, helped by the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine boosters.
(Graphic: McKesson's drug & medical product segment growth McKesson's drug & medical product segment growth: https://graphics.reuters.com/MCKESSON-RESULTS/PREVIEW/egpbklaxlvq/chart.png)
McKesson beat analysts' estimates for profit in each of the past twelve quarters, while Cardinal Health missed expectations in two of the last four quarters.

By Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP are nearing an agreement to boost their more than $4 billion offer to resolve sprawling opioid litigation after negotiating with states that had objected to terms of the OxyContin maker's bankruptcy reorganization, according to a court filing.
Sackler family members and states objecting to terms of Purdue's bankruptcy reorganization are ""close to an agreement in principle"" to contribute additional cash beyond the $4.325 billion they had pledged to settle opioid litigation, according to a mediator's interim report filed on Monday.
An agreement involving members of the Sackler family and several state attorneys general could potentially end a legal challenge that has prevented Purdue from exiting bankruptcy, and clear the way for a plan aimed at helping to abate the opioid crisis. 
The mediation kicked off in January among Sackler family members and several states after a U.S. district judge overturned the original settlement, which was the cornerstone of Purdue's bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
The judge found the reorganization plan improperly shielded Sackler family members, who had not filed for Chapter 11 themselves, from opioid litigation. 
The mediator, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, said any additional contribution from the Sacklers would be solely for opioid abatement. She asked that talks be extended to Feb. 7, a request that could be considered at a bankruptcy-court hearing on Tuesday.
The report described marathon negotiating sessions held on Jan. 25-26 in New York that ran more than 12 hours each day and involved two unidentified state attorneys general who participated in person and another who joined by Zoom.
The settlement agreement had been opposed by at least eight state attorneys general, including Bob Ferguson in Washington state and William Tong in Connecticut. 
Purdue, the maker of the highly addictive OxyContin opioid painkiller, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sacklers of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing. The opioid abuse crisis has led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to U.S. data.

Sackler family members have denied wrongdoing. Purdue pleaded guilty in November 2020 to three felonies arising from its handling of OxyContin. 
Several members of the Sackler family testified during Purdue's bankruptcy trial that their contribution to the settlement was conditioned on receiving ""global peace"" from opioid litigation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday it is proposing training revisions to help pilots avoid overly reliance on autopilot and to ensure they focus on flightpath management.
The FAA said it was issuing draft guidance and recommended practices, and said it was important that even on autopilot flight crews ""should always be aware of the aircraft's flightpath so they can intervene if necessary.""
The guidance addresses a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation sparked by a July 2013 accident of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 that struck a seawall at San Francisco Airport and fatally injured three passengers.
The draft guidance was also prompted by some requirements specified by Congress in late 2019 as part of reforms adopted after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in five months and prompted the best-selling plane's 20-month worldwide grounding.
A Congressional Research Service report issued in September noted the crash investigations ""raised questions about the increasing use of automated flight control systems and flight crew interactions with those systems, as well as broader concerns regarding human performance and human factors assumptions about pilot reactions to abnormal and emergency situations and alerts.""

The FAA said the advisory ""provides a single framework for operations and training programs. This will help pilots develop and maintain manual flight operations skills and avoid becoming overly reliant on automation.""
The FAA advisory is targeted at air carriers and training centers and descries ""acceptable ways for an operator to incorporate flightpath management principles into the operator’s training program and operational procedures.""

(Reuters) - The New York Times Co has met its target of 10 million subscriptions three years ahead of schedule thanks to its purchase of The Athletic, a win for the newspaper that has staked its future on the success of its digital business.
The Times gained more than a million subscriptions in its $550 million deal for the sports news website that closed earlier this week, swelling its already 8.8 million strong subscription base at the end of 2021. 
About 375,000 of those were added in the last three months of the year when people turned to its website and app for games, cooking recipes and news on the Omicron variant's global surge. 
The 170-year-old newspaper said on Wednesday it was now targeting at least 15 million subscriptions by the end of 2027, a goal it hopes to achieve with the help of acquisitions like the Wordle deal. 
Its shift to a subscription-first model, started a decade ago, has made up for steep declines in its traditional print business and turned it into a beacon for the newspaper industry. 
The company posted an adjusted profit of 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $594.2 million, exceeding analysts' estimates. 
Its digital ads revenue grew 23.3% to a record level as businesses continued to loosen their purse strings with the recovery in the economy. 
The Gray Lady expects the Athletic deal to help continue that momentum, projecting an increase of 20% to 24% in digital ads revenue for the first quarter.

For the current quarter, the company expects net sales to rise 5%-8% while adjusted EPS is seen at 39 cents at the midpoint of its guidance range.

(Reuters) -Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) on Wednesday reported a 24% jump in holiday-quarter sales and raised its full-year outlook, saying it would further increase prices across its brands to take advantage of soaring demand for high fashion.
Shares of the company, which also owns Versace and Jimmy Choo, jumped 10% as it extended a string of strong performances from luxury goods companies in recent weeks.
Capri joins European peers LVMH, Burberry, and Prada (OTC:PRDSY) in showing a strong rebound from the worst troughs of the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to a desire among cooped-up consumers to spoil themselves with designer handbags and apparel.
Like its rivals, Capri also said its sales were driven by demand in the United States and Europe. However, sales in Mainland China fell due to COVID-19-related lockdowns and store closures. 
The company's total revenue rose to $1.61 billion in the third quarter ended Dec. 25, ticking back up above pre-pandemic levels.
Chief Executive Officer John Idol said the company is now looking to reposition its brands, especially Versace, at higher price points.
""We've seen absolutely no consumer resistance to any of the price increases that we have taken, and there will be more as well,"" Idol said on a call with analysts. 
Previous price hikes and fewer promotions helped Capri expand profit margins amid soaring manufacturing and shipping expenses.
""Capri continues to impress on revenues and margins as they used the pandemic to re-fashion their business,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said.
""We believe they are one of the few brands that are emerging healthier from the pandemic.""

The company forecasts fiscal 2022 revenue of $5.56 billion, compared with its prior estimate of $5.4 billion, while it expects annual profit per share to be $6, up from $5.30 per share.
Capri also projected fiscal 2023 revenue of about $6.1 billion, above analysts estimates of $5.97 billion.

Investing.com — Shares of  Groupon Inc  (NASDAQ:GRPN) are down more than 16% Wednesday after the company revealed a 2.4% stake in payments service provider SumUp.
The stake may not seem like such a bad thing. However, Groupon's share price previously rose significantly due to its stake in the firm, which investment research firm Prescience Point Capital said was in the ""mid-single digits.""
Prescience released a note on Groupon Monday, stating they saw a potential 225% upside in the company's stock price based on their view of its SumUp stake. In its note, Prescience urged Groupon to disclose its stake in SumUp.
Groupon has answered that call. Under the question ""What companies do Groupon and its subsidiaries currently hold investments in?"" on its FAQ page, the e-commerce marketplace company answers that it ""holds a 2.4% non-controlling ownership interest in SumUp Holdings,"" lower than the mid-single digits Prescience had estimated. 
Nevertheless, while the stake is lower than Prescience initially thought, the investment research firm still has confidence in its Groupon thesis, stating it ""believes that Groupon's public disclosure of its stake in SumUp coupled with the recent news about SumUp's proposed funding round confirms that the investment has tremendous value.""
""With any lingering conjecture put to rest, investors may now shift their focus towards a series of imminent positive catalysts that will drive Groupon shares significantly higher in short order,"" Prescience added.
The firm believes Groupon's SumUp investment is worth $15 per share and their base case price target for Groupon is now $69.92, with a bull case price target at $99.32."

Foreign net portfolio inflows to emerging markets in January were at $1.1 billion, the lowest since last March, data from the Institute of International Finance showed. The figure compares to inflows of $79.7 billion in January 2021 and $15.8 billion in December.

By Nikolaj Skydsgaard
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Novo Nordisk on Wednesday rejected allegations by a U.S. congressional investigative committee that it has engaged in manoeuvres to increase net prices on life-saving insulin in tandem with competitors on the U.S. market. 
The report by the House Oversight Committee, the main investigative body of the U.S. House of Representatives, alleged that Novo had raised its insulin drug prices to the detriment of diabetes patients between 2001 and 2019. 
Referring to Novo, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY), which account for some 90% of the U.S. insulin market, the report released in December cited internal documents saying the three drugmakers had ""intentionally and strategically raised their prices in lockstep.""
An Eli Lilly spokesperson said at the time of the report that the company offers discounts to make its insulin affordable. A Sanofi spokesperson said the price of its insulin product Lantus had declined by almost 45% since 2012. 
And on Wednesday, Novo's Chief Executive Lars Joergensen denied the Danish company had engaged in such activities. 
""We have nothing to hide, we feel we have done business in the right way in the U.S,"" Joergensen said.
""Our net pricing is actually declining quite significantly,"" Jorgensen said, adding: ""For quite some years pricing has been going down on insulin, not going up.""
The report contained graphs showing how Novo has raised the price on its rapid-acting insulin NovoLog by 628% since 2001 by hiking it 28 times. The price rises occurred in almost perfect lockstep with rival Eli Lilly's Humalog insulin product. 
Similarly, Novo raised its prices for its long-acting insulin Levemir drug 18 times, by a total of 360% between 2006 and 2019. This happened in tandem with Sanofi's price hikes on its Lantus product, the report said.
""As companies raised prices on their drugs, internal data shows that net prices - prices after accounting for all discounts and rebates - also increased for most of the drugs,"" the U.S. report stated. 
""Net prices for all of the drugs examined are significantly higher today than at launch,"" it added. 
However in its annual report on Wednesday, Novo said net prices on its insulin product portfolio in the U.S. have decreased by double digit percentages every year since 2017. 

In an emailed statement to Reuters, Novo said the list price of NovoLog had risen 403% between 2001 and 2018, more than 200 percentage points less than presented in the U.S. report, while its net price had risen just 28% in the same period.
Novo is currently defending itself against eight lawsuits in the United States, which are related to its pricing of diabetes medicine, according to its annual report. Eli Lilly and Sanofi are also defendants in those cases.

American depository shares in JD, each representing two ordinary shares of the company, closed at $75.08 on Tuesday and were last trading down nearly 1.9% on Wednesday.

HELSINKI (Reuters) -Reduced liquidity in the Chinese property sector and rising supply chain costs are expected to weigh on 2022 profits, elevator maker Kone said on Wednesday, as it reported a year-on-year fall in fourth-quarter core earnings.
The Finnish company's share price fell by as much as 3% before recovering to trade 0.9% lower in afternoon trade, underperforming the wider index, which was slightly higher.
Kone, which relies on China for approximately 35% of its sales, gave a first estimate for its 2022 profits, expecting its adjusted operating income to be 1.18-1.33 billion euros ($1.33-$1.50 billion), slightly down from 1.31 billion in full-year 2021. 
""We expect the (new equipment) markets in China this year to remain on a solid level, although to decline somewhat compared to 2021. And that's of course because of the liquidity situation in the property markets,"" Chief Executive Henrik Ehrnrooth told reporters.
""We can see that land sales, new construction starts are both down,"" he said.
Ehrnrooth said Kone expected the Chinese new equipment market would return to its 2019 level in 2022 and the business sector would grow outside China.
It also predicted its services business would continue to perform well.
""The adjusted EBIT margin, on the other hand, is expected to decline due to lower margins on orders received in 2021 and continued challenges in the cost environment,"" Ehrnrooth said in a statement.
Global supply chain challenges were also showing no sign of going away, Ehrnrooth said, adding sea freight charges were five to six times higher than before the pandemic.
Already, October-December operating profit was reduced by global supply chain distruptions and fell to 351.9 million euros from 367 million a year earlier, missing the 356-million estimate of nine analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Kone's board of directors proposed a dividend of 1.75 euros per class B share plus an extraordinary dividend of 0.35 euros per class B share.

The rule-breaking was an embarrassment for the former Lloyds (LON:LLOY) chief executive who left on January 17, less than nine months after he joined Credit Suisse to help it move on after a series of scandals. [L1N2TW0J0]
Horta-Osorio breached COVID-19 quarantine rules twice in 2021. In December, Reuters reported that an internal bank investigation had found Horta-Osorio attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in London in July without following Britain's quarantine rules. [L1N2ST1R9]
The executive also broke Swiss COVID-19 rules in November by leaving the country during a 10-day quarantine period, the bank said last month. [L1N2ST1R9]
After resigning, Horta-Osorio expressed regret that his ""personal actions ... compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally"".
The penalty order was imposed by prosecutors in the Uznach district of canton St. Gallen, the Blick paper reported earlier on Wednesday. Horta-Osorio must also pay court fees.
""We can confirm the fine amount of 2000.00 Swiss francs and the fee of 350.00 Swiss francs,"" St Gallen prosecutors said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. ""Please note that this decision is not yet legally binding.""
Horta-Osorio accepted the ruling, a spokesperson said. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment. The bank has since replaced 58-year old Horta-Osorio with Axel Lehmann, 62, who joined the bank's board in October 2021 to become head of its risk committee.
Horta-Osorio will have earned roughly 3.5 million Swiss francs during his short stint at Credit Suisse, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

Earnings at companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 equity benchmark are expected to have risen 55% year-on-year in the last three months of 2021, a steep upward revision from last week's forecast of a 51% rise.
Refinitiv said 67.4% of companies which reported their results as of Monday had exceeded expectations, a figure well above the 52% beat of a typical quarter. 
""We are seeing corporate earnings expectations revised higher and that is a sign that markets don't expect economic momentum to fade yet despite the extent of policy tightening being priced in globally"", said Ankit Gheedia, head of equities and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""This is a positive tailwind for stock markets"", he added.
The reporting season in Europe will reach its peak in three weeks time and by the end of February more than 72% of companies will have already reported their results, according to UBS. 
Earnings for companies listed on Wall Street's S&P 500 index are seen rising at more modest 25% pace in the fourth quarter but that is seen as a reflection of the European economy being some time behind the United States in the COVID-19 recovery cycle. 
On Feb. 1, Refinitiv stated that out of the 184 S&P 500 companies which had reported earnings, 78.8% exceeded analyst expectations, well above the historic average of 66%.

The strong performance of two of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s growth drivers could help allay some fears around the company's future performance as Humira, the world's best-selling drug, faces the loss of patent exclusivity next year in the United States, its biggest market.
Sales of Botox, which AbbVie acquired through its $63 billion purchase of Allergan (NYSE:AGN), have recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic lows. The company has been focused on gaining expanded approvals for plaque psoriasis drug Skyrizi as well as Rinvoq, which treats rheumatic arthritis and eczema. 
In the fourth quarter, sales of Humira, which is already facing copycat rivals in Europe, rose 3.5% to $5.33 billion, missing estimates of $5.41 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company reported sales of $895 million for Skyrizi, which beat estimates of $867.22 million, and $626 million in Botox sales for cosmetic uses, which topped estimates of $569.78 million. 
Sales of Rinvoq jumped 84.4% to $517 million. 
Total revenue of $14.89 billion missed estimates of $14.97 billion. 
Net earnings rose to $4.04 billion, or $2.26 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $36 million, or $0.01 per share, a year ago. The company had recorded a $4.7 billion increase in the contingent consideration liability related to Skyrizi last year.
Excluding items, AbbVie earned $3.31 per share, beating estimates of $3.29 per share. 

The company said it expects 2022 adjusted profit to be between $14.00 and $14.20 per share, compared with $12.70 per share in 2021. Analysts were expecting a profit of $13.99 per share.

Carmakers are working to secure supplies of materials from lithium, nickel and manganese for batteries to magnesium for car components as they race to ramp up electric vehicle production, but rising raw material costs have dug into their margins.

Some, including Mercedes-Benz - which changed its name from Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) on Tuesday after splitting from Daimler Truck - have lifted prices for consumers to cushion the blow.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Aeromexico looks set to emerge from bankruptcy within days, but analysts believe the Mexican airline faces stiff challenges taking on low-cost competitors like Volaris, now the country's busiest airline.
Aeromexico, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2020 as demand cratered in the first months of the pandemic, on Friday won final court approval for a restructuring plan that aims to reduce its debt from $2 billion to more than $1 billion.
But even after slashing its debt load and operating costs under Chapter 11 protection, Aeromexico may struggle to claw back ground lost to low-cost carriers like Volaris, which has surpassed it as Mexico's biggest airline by passenger traffic.
The convalescent airline could have ""gone even further to reduce costs"", said Rene Armas Maes, Commercial Vice President and Aeronautical Consultant at Jet Link International LLC.
Aeromexico succeeded in lowering the number of employees per plane to 109 in the first months of 2021 from 133 in 2019, but still had about 14 extra full-time employees per aircraft compared to its peers by the end of last year, he said.
The employee-to-aircraft ratio includes all employees from pilots to administrative personnel on the ground.
Aeromexico, which operates more than 120 aircraft, is overstaffed by 1,600 employees, according to Armas' international airline benchmark.
The company's representative declined to comment on the timetable for its exit from bankruptcy and its strategy beyond that milestone.
The comeback plan contains some assumptions that look optimistic, including that it will rebound to pre-pandemic capacity, as measured by Available Seat Kilometers by the end of 2022, whereas industry consensus is that traffic will be at pre-COVID levels by mid-2023 or 2024, he said.
Although capacity has no direct relationship with profitability, it is an important sign of their ability to balance supply and demand, Armas said.
With Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) becoming the airline's largest shareholder as a result of a bankruptcy-related debt-to-equity swap, the controlling investors' most likely course of action will be to downsize the company ""to make it more efficient,"" Black Wallstreet Capital Mexico analyst Jacobo Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez also said the new owners could sell parts of the company or certain assets like its fleet or slots in airports to boost profitability and keep business running.
Aeromexico's Chief Executive Andres Conesa - who has held the job since 2005 - expressed his gratitude to his team and the new group of investors for the trust placed on the airline in a statement on Friday.

Aeromexico would struggle to take on Volaris' lower cost structure even after cutting its expenses, leaving the airline as a legacy carrier more focused on business travelers, who remain sparse as the pandemic rages, said Marco Antonio Montanez, an analyst with Vector brokerage.
""It will be able to recover its market share bit by bit, even if it's clear that recovery will be slow,"" he said. ""Aeromexico must explore ways to lower its costs and compete, but I don't see it becoming a low-cost airline.""

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>","A year on, GameStop champion Roaring Kitty is quiet - yet much richer","(Editor's note: This story contains language in the 4th and 8th paragraphs that some readers may find offensive.)
By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year ago, office worker Keith Gill shot to global notoriety when his ""Roaring Kitty"" YouTube persona stoked a trading frenzy with bullish bets that propelled shares of retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) to eye-popping gains and saddled hedge funds that had bet against the stock with billions of dollars in losses.
Gill has returned to obscurity: albeit much richer thanks to his GameStop positions that at one point reached $48 million in value. He no longer works in marketing at insurer MassMutual.
The Massachusetts securities regulator is still probing Gill's activities around the Reddit rally, a spokeswoman said. But in April, a court dismissed a lawsuit alleging Gill violated securities laws by inciting the rally in GameStop and causing “huge losses” for investors. 
Known as ""Roaring Kitty"" on YouTube and ""DeepF***ingValue"" on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum, Gill was a key figure in the so-called ""Reddit rally"" which saw shares of GameStop surge 1600% at one point in Jan. 2021. 
The stock, which peaked at $482.95 a share when hedge funds that had shorted GameStop were forced to buy at any price, has come back to earth. But it is still at about $112 a share, compared to less than $20 on Jan. 1, 2021. 
With colorful YouTube streams and Reddit posts touting his GameStop positions, Gill made the bull case for GameStop, helping to attract a flood of retail cash into the beleaguered bricks-and-mortar retailer.
The furious rally in GameStop and other ""memestocks"" burned hedge funds, rocked Wall Street and drew scrutiny from state and federal regulators. Gill and other traders and financial executives were grilled in the U.S. Congress. 
Gill faded away almost as quickly as he shot to fame. His last posts on WallStreetBets via his ‘DeepF**ingValue’ handle and his Roaring Kitty YouTube stream were on April 16, 2021. The last tweet from his @TheRoaringKitty handle, a video of a kitten, was on June 18, 2021. 
A public records search indicates Gill has no new business ventures. Gill did not respond to requests for comment. 
But in testimony last year to Congress, he denied the notion that he used social media to profit by promoting GameStop to unwitting investors. 
""I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks,"" he told lawmakers, adding his investment thesis focused purely on GameStop's fundamentals.
""We’ve learned just what someone like that can do to the market and to investors,"" said Joshua Mitts, an associate professor at Columbia Law School who has researched the use of social media to influence stocks.
Mitts said the meme stock rally was driven by an unusual combination of factors: an army of new retail traders, easy money thanks to pandemic stimulus and low interest rates, and Gill's purportedly massive and consistent profits. 
Still, he said, it could happen again. 
“What I expect to see going forward is social media personalities making money by driving prices in one direction or another -- not necessarily in the magnitude that we had.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on whether it was probing, or ever had probed, Gill's actions.
Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer, said it remained unclear whether Gill broke any laws. Yet he said his fanatical following among retail traders appeared to be based on ""tribal identity"" rather than economics, and was troubling.
""It might be too early to determine whether that was simply a fad that has now run its course, or whether it represents a fundamental alteration of market practice.""
Gill began sharing his positions on WallStreetBets in September 2019, posting a screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop. By late Jan. 2021, Gill was up over 4,000% on stock and options in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his posts. 

In his last April 16 post on WallStreetBets, Gill shared screen shots showing he had exercised call options on GameStop to acquire 50,000 more shares in the retailer, sparking thousands of comments lauding the punchy move.

Companies across North America have been rushing to add robots to their assembly lines to keep up with strong demand at a time when many of them have struggled to lure back workers displaced by the pandemic.
That led to first-quarter sales at Emerson's Automation Solutions unit, its biggest business, jumping 4.2% to $2.81 billion. It caters to sectors from utility and mining to chemicals and automotive.
With economies reopening on easing restrictions and U.S. homebuilding activity hitting a nine-month high in December, Emerson's commercial and residential market division saw sales rising 13% to $1.67 billion. 
St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson, which began life as a seller of fans and electric motors a century ago, has been pivoting more towards technology solutions to capitalize on an evolving industrial software market.
Excluding items, Emerson earned $1.05 per share, above Wall Street expectations of 99 cents per share.

The company's net income rose to $896 million, or $1.50 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $445 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.
Net revenue rose 8% to $4.5 billion in Emerson's first quarter.

Horton Inc on Wednesday raised its fiscal 2022 revenue forecast as it benefits from record-high home prices that helped the largest U.S. homebuilder report a stellar quarterly profit.
D.R. Horton's shares rose 3.4% before the bell as the company beat first-quarter profit estimates despite an acute shortage of properties on the market, largely due to labor and raw material shortages. 
U.S. homebuilding jumped to a nine-month high in December and new home sales increased 11.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units in the month, the highest level since March, the U.S. commerce department said last week. 
""Housing market conditions remain very robust,"" Chairman Donald R. Horton said, adding that D.R. Horton was on track to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022.
The Texas-based company said it expects 2022 revenue between $34.5 billion and $35.5 billion, up from $32.5 billion to $33.5 billion, and homes closed between 90,000 homes and 92,000 homes. 
Homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 17% to $6.7 billion from $5.7 billion a year earlier, while total revenue rose to $7.05 billion from $5.93 billion.
Net income attributable rose to $1.14 billion, or $3.17 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $791.8 million, or $2.14 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of $ 2.79 per share on revenue of $6.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales orders for the first quarter ended December 31 increased 5% to 21,522 homes to $8.26 billion compared to 20,418 homes and $6.42 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.

1124,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 07:41AM ET</span>","PayPal Tumbles as Spending Slows, EBay Split Impact Plays Out","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – PayPal stock (NASDAQ:PYPL) plummeted nearly 17% in premarket trading Wednesday as online spending slows and the full impact of its disengagement with former parent eBay  (NASDAQ:EBAY) unfolds.  
The company continues to suffer from the impact of EBay transitioning to its own payments platform, a separation worked out in 2015 when PayPal was spun out of the e-commerce marketplace operator.
The split with EBay is expected to cost $600 million in revenue in the first half of this year, Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman as telling analysts in a conference call. That will slow overall revenue growth this quarter to only 6%, barely half of what analysts had forecast, and less than half the 13% growth recorded in the final quarter of last year.
Compared to 26% growth in the third quarter, total payment volume growth slipped to 23% in the fourth. The pandemic forced businesses to digitize and the acceptance of PayPal’s platform among consumers and merchants grew. That growth is now abating as consumption adjusts to normal levels, and shoppers return to physical stores.
PayPal sees itself adding just 15 million-20 million net new active accounts this year, barely a third of the 49 million it added in 2021.
The platform closed the month with 426 million active accounts. According to Bloomberg, it has abandoned its guidance of having 750 million active accounts by 2025, a decision arising out of its discovery of 4.5 million accounts created illegitimately.
Adjusted profit per share of $1.11 was higher than $1.08 a year ago but fell short of estimates.  "

The investment of $10 billion to $20 billion will be spread out over the next five to ten years and will include converting its present factories around the world to electric-vehicle production, the report https:// said, citing people familiar with the plan. 
Under a plan dubbed ""Ford+"" meant to have investors value it more like a technology company, the No. 2 U.S. automaker had already pledged to spend over $30 billion on EVs, including battery development, by 2030.
The latest push is being led by a former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive, the report said. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla, joined Ford last year to lead the automaker's advanced technology and embedded systems efforts. 
Major automakers from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford and Volvo Cars are swiftly making changes to take their piece of the pie in a competitive EV space and fight against electric car challenger Tesla Inc. 
The report added Ford has evaluated spinning off a small portion of its EV business as a part of the reorganization, to capture value in an electric startup environment boosted by investor sentiment.
The new plan also includes hiring an unspecified number of engineers to work on concepts such as battery chemistry, artificial intelligence and EV software, the report said, indicating the rising importance of software and digital connectivity in the auto industry. 

""We're carrying out our ambitious Ford+ plan to transform the company and thrive in the new era of connected, electric vehicles,"" the company's spokesman said, adding they do not comment on rumors and speculations.

(Reuters) -Starbucks Corp will raise menu prices in 2022 and reduce some spending to offset soaring costs for labor and goods, as rising COVID-19 cases prompted the coffee chain on Tuesday to lower estimates for profits this year.
The company missed estimates for quarterly profits and comparable sales as the fast-spreading Omicron variant also led to delayed office reopenings and new restrictions in China, the company's fastest growing market.
Shares fell slightly in extended trading, following a 16% drop last month. 
Restaurants are paying more for everything from chicken and cooking oil to packaging and transportation services amid record inflation and COVID-19 disruptions, and many, including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have raised wages amid the labor shortage.
The extra costs have eaten into margins. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) profits also missed estimates when it reported its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday.
Similarly, Starbucks reported profits of 72 cents per share, missing Wall Street estimates of 80 cents. The company revised its expected adjusted earnings per share growth forecast for 2022 to 8-10%, from at least 10% previously.
The Seattle-based chain - whose workers in more than 50 of its U.S. stores are seeking to unionize - has also paid more to train new employees and for them to isolate after exposure to COVID-19.
""When the Omicron surge began, inflationary costs and staffing shortages were amplified, well in excess of our expectations,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said during a call with investors.
After hiking menu prices in October and January, the chain plans to raise them again in 2022 and will cut spending on marketing and promotions, Johnson said.
Starbucks did not specify the products for which it would raise prices. A venti cappuccino is now $5.25.
Global comparable sales rose 13% in the first quarter ended Jan. 2, Starbucks said, while analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES had expected growth of 13.2%. 
Same-store sales in the international division declined 3%, reflecting a 14% drop in China. Analysts had expected a 0.5% increase in the international segment. 
Several Chinese cities have closed seating areas and restricted movement to curb COVID-19 ahead of the Winter Olympics, knocking the coffee chain's revenue. The brand also came under fire in the country after a report said two of its stores used expired ingredients.

Comparable sales in the United States jumped 18%, benefiting from new cold beverages, higher prices and an increase in rewards members.
Total net revenue rose 19% to $8.1 billion, while analysts had expected $7.95 billion.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp raised its full-year profit forecast by 15% on Wednesday after posting estimate-smashing quarterly earnings, propelled by the success of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" which has become the sixth-highest grossing movie. 
Operating profit at its pictures business jumped by more than seven-fold to 149.4 billion yen ($1.30 billion) in its fiscal third quarter ended December as the unit's revenue more than doubled.
It now expects the business to post a profit of 205 billion yen in the current fiscal year as the super-hero movie, released in December, grossed more than $1.7 billion worldwide despite the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
The segment was also boosted by receipts from the ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" movie and licensing of the ""Seinfeld"" sitcom along with the sale of mobile games business GSN Games. 
Overall quarterly operating profit at Sony - a conglomerate spanning areas such as entertainment, sensors and financial services - was 465.2 billion yen, compared with an estimated average profit of 351.6 billion yen from nine analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
Sony, which switched to IFRS accounting standards from U.S. GAAP in the current financial year, increased its full-year profit forecast to 1.2 trillion yen from 1.04 trillion yen. That prediction is higher than an average 1.09 trillion yen profit forecast from 24 analysts, Refinitiv data showed. 
The company's main gaming segment, focused on PlayStation, also posted a rise in profit, with sales of 3.9 million PS5 units in the third quarter, but hardware supply was hampered by component shortages. 
Sony cut its full-year PS5 sales forecast to 11.5 million units from 14.8 million units previously in response. 
IMMERSIVE WORLDS
The group is looking to retain its industry position by riding two of the technology sector's most disruptive trends, the growth of immersive, online gaming and the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles. 
On Tuesday, the company announced it will buy Bungie Inc, the original creator of the ""Halo"" videogame, for $3.6 billion. That comes after XBox console maker  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said last month it will purchase ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $69 billion. 
Bungie is experienced in developing long-running online titles, as opposed to Sony's expertise in single-player games. The group aims to launch more than 10 live service titles by March 2026, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki told a news conference.
The Japanese consumer tech company may also branch out into electric vehicles (EVs), with Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida unveiling a new EV prototype and announcing the creation of a mobility business at a tech trade show in Las Vegas last month.
Growing demand for EVs is spurring new entrants into auto markets. Through EVs, Sony is aiming to build a business that will transform cars from transportation machines to entertainment spaces. 
Sony is looking to pick new partners for its EV project based on the technology they can bring as it aims to keep operations asset light, avoiding chunky investments in areas like batteries or manufacturing.
In November chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said it had agreed to build a $7 billion chip plant in Japan that will supply Sony with semiconductors for its image sensor business from 2024.

Sony shares closed up 4.9% on Wednesday ahead of the earnings and have fallen 7.4% year-to-date.

The share slide set the stock up for its lowest opening since May 2020, as PayPal also listed out a number of other factors hurting its performance, including high inflation, the end of stimulus checks and the impact of the ongoing supply chain issues on cross-border volumes.
At least 11 analysts cut their price targets on the stock and BTIG downgraded its recommendation to ""neutral"" from ""buy"".
PayPal's operating agreement with eBay, its former parent, has ended and the online marketplace's transition to its own payments platform is impacting transaction volumes, the company said on Tuesday.
EBay's transition is expected to put $600 million of revenue pressure in the first half of this year, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said on a conference call with analysts.
""Taken together, supply chain management problems, inflationary pressure on spending by low income customers and ongoing steep declines in eBay volumes created stiff headwinds exiting 4Q/21 that will persist at least through 1H/22,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.
PayPal projected a 6% rise in revenue in the current quarter, far lower than the 11.7% growth estimated by analysts, as per IBES data from Refinitiv.

E-commerce growth rates during the holiday season were lower than industry expectations, PayPal said.

(Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s admissions of sexual assault, racism and bullying in an internal report have sparked calls from investors for the entire industry to clean up its act.
An 85-page report released by Rio on Tuesday that pointed to a culture where harmful behaviours are often normalised and bullying is rife put a spotlight on the broader industry, which has long been accused of tolerating inappropriate behaviour.
""We ...want to see the normalisation of a zero tolerance approach to sexual assault and discriminatory practices, in much the same way as we have for zero workplace fatalities,"" said Camille Simeon, investment director at abrdn, a top-30 investor in Rio's London-listed shares according to Refinitiv data. 
""We are committed to holding investee companies to account on such matters...(and) expect that the findings of this report will motivate other boards into action,"" Simeon said, adding that abrdn would follow up with Rio on the report.
Two other top-20 investors told Reuters they also planned to speak to the company about the report, but declined to comment further ahead of the meeting.
Pension fund Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia also said it was writing to mining companies to ask how they are addressing similar potential issues. 
Miners, who have struggled to attract female workers, even as they grapple with a labour shortage, have been trying for several years to change a ""boys club"" culture. Top global miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) has an ""ambitious, aspirational goal"" of achieving gender balance globally by 2025.
Investors and industry players gave Rio Tinto credit for publishing the damning findings from an external review but said others in the industry, and beyond, needed to act as well.
""It shouldn't be left to Rio Tinto. This is an industry problem. It's a society problem. It's no good them solving the problem on their side and it continues elsewhere,"" Greg Busson, the Mining and Energy Union's Western Australia state secretary, said.
Rio Tinto launched the review in March last year, not long after CEO Jakob Stausholm took over the top job in the wake of a backlash over the company's destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine.
In the last year, 142 individuals had sanctions against them and 38 had their employment terminated, a Rio spokesperson said.
Activist investor group Market Forces said Juukan Gorge highlighted a culture of arrogance and other deep seated issues at Rio Tinto, which had bubbled to the surface through this report.
""The findings of this report demonstrate the need for increased and strong investor scrutiny of Rio Tinto and its governance practices,"" said Will Van De Pol, asset management campaigner at Market Forces.
""Clearly there is a need to improve culturally at Rio Tinto and this is yet another moment that needs to catalyse further change, and that would be something that we would be really keen to see infiltrate throughout Rio Tinto.""
TOXIC CULTURE
Tuesday's report, which took nearly a year for an outside firm to complete and involved feedback from nearly a quarter of Rio's 45,000 employees, provides a detailed disclosure of toxic workplace practices. 
One female worker described being asked to perform oral sex on a male colleague. When the request was reported, a supervisor said he was sure the man was joking and Rio would ""make sure you're not alone with him.""
Another worker said pejorative name-calling of people of colour is routine and accepted as normal work site banter. 
One female employee said she would not recommend Rio to her friends as a place to work, a stinging indictment of a company that has said publicly for years it aims to boost gender diversity. Women comprise 19% of Rio's workforce.
""Other companies need to take this as a signal that the human element can't be ignored,"" said Katie Mehnert of Ally Energy, a networking group connecting workers with companies in the renewable energy industry. 
""You can have the best assets on the planet, but if your culture is trash, who will want to work for you?""
Rio CEO Stausholm, who commissioned the report, vowed to push for change.
""As CEO, I own the culture,"" Stausholm told Reuters. ""Now I know what I know, and I clearly have an obligation to address it."" 
Advocacy groups for women in mining and other extractive industries cautiously welcomed the report, which tacitly acknowledges what many in the mining industry have whispered about for years.
""We hope this example Rio Tinto is setting will foster dialogue and will make other mining companies follow suit,"" said Barbara Dischinger, director of London-based International Women in Mining, a nonprofit that promotes gender equality in the mining industry.
BHP said it was committed to an inclusive and diverse workplace where people were respected. Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) CEO Elizabeth Gaines said the miner had a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to harassment and bullying and all complaints were taken seriously.
Miners often work long hours in harsh environments for weeks at a time, living side by side in small camps with little privacy.
A Reuters reporter in 2018 witnessed miners, gathered for an industry convention, dropping their pants to sing karaoke in their underwear. 
The perception of mining as hostile to women and people of colour has only exacerbated the industry's talent problem, with enrolment in mining engineering programs plunging across the United States, Canada and Australia. 

Employees in Rio's report described immense stress and anxiety trying to avoid sexual harassers, harming their concentration and productivity on the job. 
""It is clear there are significant challenges that need to be addressed both at the company level and across the sector,"" said Louise Davidson, CEO of Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents 37 asset owners and institutional investors which collectively own on average 10% of every ASX200 company.

(Reuters) - The Teamsters union wants four large U.S. retailers to investigate if companies in their supply chains are underpaying workers, hoping the retailers will use their leverage with vendors to achieve greater protection for those individuals. 
The union has filed resolutions for shareholder meetings this spring at Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW),  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) and Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN), according to union officials and documents seen by Reuters. Only one, at Lowe's, so far has been disclosed in public filings.
They are among a wave of resolutions set to make ""human capital management,"" or HCM, a chief topic of the upcoming shareholder meeting season this spring. The term has come to cover both traditional personnel issues like recruiting and skills development, and broader subjects like workforce diversity and pay that are part of an increased global focus on inequality fueled by the COVID pandemic. 
The resolutions also come as companies grapple with worker shortages that have contributed to rising prices and bare shelves.
The union does not represent workers at the retailers. But it does represent workers at some logistics companies and hopes to represent more of them. 
The Teamsters said the retailers have likely used logistics companies that have faced legal challenges from drivers over their labor practices at Southern California ports. 
In October, one logistics firm agreed to pay $30 million to resolve allegations including that drivers were paid less than minimum wages, according to legal filings. 
Relying on partners with records of poor working conditions could expose the retailers to bad publicity, and to legal liability in California, according to the Teamsters. 
The potential use of underpaid subcontractors ""is the very antithesis of what investors mean by HCM,"" said Michael Pryce-Jones, Teamsters' senior governance analyst. 
None of the retailers would discuss their logistics arrangements in detail.
Lowe's on Jan. 24 asked securities regulators for permission to skip a vote on the Teamsters' proposal, arguing among other things that it falls under an exemption for ""ordinary business.""
Representatives for Lowe's, Best Buy and Urban Outfitters did not respond to requests for comment.
A TJX spokeswoman declined to comment on the proposal but said TJX requires its service providers to comply with applicable laws and rules.
GROWING NOTICE
Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute, which tracks shareholder proposals, said filers look on track this year to match the record number of 115 HCM proposals filed for U.S. company meetings held in 2021.
The Teamsters resolutions, she said, could do well based on other votes last year on resolutions about working conditions, which won 52% support on average. But Welsh cautioned it remains to be seen whether the SEC will allow the vote. The SEC declined to comment.
The SEC in coming months also may suggest revisions to HCM disclosure rules. The Teamsters and other unions have urged the agency to mandate that companies include in their workforce disclosures details about individuals like contractors or drivers who are not on their payrolls but still matter to investors. 

Tom Quaadman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading trade group, said it would prefer the SEC stick with 2020 rules put in place when the commission was controlled by appointees of former U.S. President Donald Trump.
These encouraged companies to describe their human capital ""to the extent such disclosures would be material to an understanding"" of a company's business, a simpler standard.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Julius Baer remained upbeat on Wednesday about a pickup in client activity despite reporting a slowdown in the latter half of 2021, which raised some concerns about its outlook going forward.
Despite reporting 55% full-year profit growth and a significant uplift to proposed shareholder payouts, shares fell 6.1% in late morning trading as analysts pointed to a compression in profitability in the second half. 
""Operationally, Julius Baer delivered in line with expectations, but margin weakness during the second half of the year keeps the question of what can be expected going forward hot,"" analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank said in a note.
Net profit climbed 55% to 1.083 billion Swiss francs ($1.18 billion) in 2021, as strong markets and a rise in fees it gets from managing cash for rich clients helped the Swiss bank surpass a billion-franc bottomline for the first time ever. 
""I think we have an environment that is volatile and where there is a lot happening in the market,"" Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher told journalists after the bank reported earnings. ""Typically in the past, these environments have been beneficial for client trading and they have been beneficial for our business model.""
Wealth managers saw a boon from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, benefitting from bumper client activity levels and fewer risks of loan losses than their high street peers.
That continued in the first half of 2021, when the Zurich-based wealth manager posted https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/wealth/julius-baer-reports-234-h1-net-profit-rise-2021-07-21 a 23.4% boost to six-month net profit, although there was a slowdown in the second half.
Julius Baer posted 19.6 billion francs in fresh client inflows for 2021, a growth rate of 4.5% and well above prior-year inflows. Combined with higher asset prices, that helped push the lender's managed assets up 11% to a record 482 billion Swiss francs.
However, client inflows eased slightly in the second half, additional documents provided by the bank showed, while, on an adjusted basis, net profit from July through December dropped to 507 million francs, down from 636 million francs in the first six months. Costs were also up slightly more than analysts expected.

Switzerland's third-largest listed lender proposed raising its dividend to 2.60 francs per share from the 1.75 francs it paid in 2020. It also announced a new share buy-back programme of up to 400 million francs, and said it would unveil a new mid-term strategy in May.

The major Wall Street indices closed higher Tuesday, climbing for the third session in a row as investors turned their attention towards generally strong corporate earnings after January’s sharp selloff. 
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed more than 270 points, or 0.8%, higher, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%.
Alphabet reported a 32% jump in its fourth-quarter revenue, profiting from sustained high demand for its search, Cloud and YouTube services, while total revenue topped $75 billion, a new record.  
The company also announced plans to split its stock 20-for-one, making it stock more affordable to a wider set of investors and potentially eligible for inclusion in more market indexes.
Staying in the tech sector, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also likely to be in focus after its annual revenue forecast beat expectations after the close Tuesday on strong quarterly demand for its semiconductors, despite global supply snags.
Meta Platforms, previously known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is due to release its fourth quarter numbers later Wednesday, and analysts will be listening to what it says about the outlook for ads.
Elsewhere, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) will also be in the spotlight after reporting numbers late Tuesday, while earnings from the likes of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), DR Horton (SA:D1HI34) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) will also be studied Wednesday.
The main release on the economic front comes in the form of the ADP private payroll report, at 8:15 AM ET (1315 GMT),  which will be closely parsed for clues ahead of Friday’s government’s jobs report.
Private job growth is likely to have decelerated to 207,000 in January after recording its fastest pace in seven months in December, when it rose 807,000.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday, ahead of the outcome of the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to discuss future production levels.
A drop in U.S. stockpiles, suggesting continued demand in the world's largest energy consumer, pushed crude prices towards seven-year highs late Tuesday.
The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories fell by 1.65 million barrels last week, compared with an expected increase of 1.5 million barrels. The official U.S. inventory levels from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $88.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $89.00. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 at the end of last week.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) released 750 million euros ($846 million) in pandemic-related provisions in the fourth quarter, betting on an economic recovery in its main markets and helping boost net profit eight-fold compared to a year earlier.
The coronavirus crisis forced banks in Europe to set aside costly provisions to protect their books from any potential fallout. But banks, mainly in the United States and Britain, are starting to reduce them due to improved economic conditions.
Santander's release in provisions came in at the lower end of its previously guided write-back of 700 million to 1 billion euros for the last quarter of 2021.
Net profit of 2.28 billion in the October to December period, a 4.6% rise over the third quarter, while the bank reported a profit of 8.12 billion euros for full-year 2021 after a record annual loss of 8.77 billion euros in 2020.
Quarterly and full-year profit matched analysts' forecasts.
With an improved economic outlook, Santander forecast a return on equity ratio (ROTE), a measure of profitability, of over 13% in 2022, up from 12.73% by the end of 2021. 
Santander's tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio, the strictest measures of solvency, rose to 12.12% from 11.85% in September. The ratio would be 11.96% when already announced corporate transactions are factored in. It kept a target of 12%.
Shares, up 7% this year, fell 0.8% on Wednesday compared with a 0.4% rise in the European banking index.
EMERGING MARKETS FOCUS
""The lack of a more visible capital build up remains the main drag for the share,"" UBS said, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the results were robust with ""positive developments seen in the Spain, with Brazil and the U.S. relatively solid.""
Santander has expanded in emerging economies in search of faster growth than core markets in Europe, where it is cutting costs to cope with ultra low interest rates.
The bank said it aimed for a cost-income ratio, a measure of efficiency, of about 45% at group level in 2022 from 46.2% now.
In Britain, which accounted for almost a fifth of quarterly earnings, underlying net profit more than doubled from a year ago thanks partly to 245 million euros in provision write-backs.
In the United States, which also made up more than a fifth of earnings, profit in underlying terms doubled against the same quarter of 2020 amid a strong U.S. economic recovery.
Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 8.7% to 8.72 billion euros in the fourth quarter, beating forecasts for 8.51 billion euros.

In Brazil, accounting for almost a quarter of underlying profit, net interest income rose 17.2% year on year in the quarter. In Mexico lending income increased by 4.1%, while it fell 7.7% in Spain compared to the same quarter a year ago.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 06:46AM ET</span>",Meta in focus after strong report by Alphabet boosts confidence,"By Nivedita Balu and Danielle Kaye
(Reuters) - The holidays were a gift to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, quarterly results showed. Next up: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc.
Alphabet's internet advertising, cloud computing and hardware businesses helped the Google owner soundly beat Wall Street targets for the holiday quarter, sending shares up as much as 9% in after-hours trading.
Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence, at the ad-buying giant GroupM, said Alphabet's results reinforce that the advertising industry as a whole is in a strong position, despite changes by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that prevent advertisers from tracking iPhone and iPad users without their consent. That has been a concern for social media companies including Meta and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP).
Unlike the previous quarter, during which marketers low on product and tech industry privacy changes led to lost sales, Google did not note any particular challenges this time around.
""It sets up well going into Meta Platform's earnings,"" after the market close on Wednesday, said Gene Munster of investment firm Loup Ventures.
Alphabet's results drove a rally across internet advertising companies. Shares of Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Inc, Magnite Inc, PubMatic Inc and several more companies that both compete and work with Google all rose in after hours trading late Tuesday.
Recent revenue beats by Alphabet, Apple and others in the tech industry come amid concerns that software and equipment makers alike cannot hold on to gains in usage from earlier in the pandemic. In a generally jittery market, as inflation kicks in, shares fell last month.
Still, ""When you look at markets, when the big companies are doing well, you know it's hard to say that there's a problem with the economy,"" said Paul McCarthy, president at investment firm Kisco Capital.
In the fourth quarter, Alphabet's advertising revenue rose 32.5% to $61.2 billion, $4 billion above Wall Street targets, according to Refinitiv data.

Microchip (NASDAQ:MCHP) maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc also posted strong results on Tuesday for the just-ended quarter. AMD projected 2022 revenue above expectations, driving its shares up as much as 11% in after-hours trading.
But with further inflation looming, Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), cautioned that shares of tech companies are ""unlikely to have seen the worst of the pain.""

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 06:18AM ET</span>","Robots marched on in 2021, with record orders by North American firms","By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - More robots joined the U.S. workforce last year than ever before, taking on jobs from plucking bottles and cans off conveyor belts at trash recycling plants to putting small consumer goods into cardboard boxes at e-commerce warehouses.
It looks like still more robots will come aboard in 2022.
Companies across North America laid out more than $2 billion for almost 40,000 robots in 2021 to help them contend with record demand and a pandemic-fueled labor shortage. Robots went to work in a growing number of industries, expanding well beyond their historic surge in the automotive sector.
""With human labor, what they produce depends on if they're hungry or are they tired or have they had their coffee,"" said Brian Tu, chief revenue officer for DCL Logistics in Fremont, California, which started installing robots on e-commerce fulfillment lines during the pandemic. Robots are dependably fast and do not take breaks.
Factories and other industrial users ordered 39,708 robots in 2021, 28% more than in 2020, according to data compiled by the industry group the Association for Advancing Automation, also known as A3. The previous annual record for robot orders was set in 2017 - when North American companies ordered 34,904 robots valued at $1.9 billion.
As recently as 2016, more than twice as many robots were sold to auto makers as to all other industry sectors combined. But in 2020, other businesses eclipsed automakers as buyers of the advanced machines, and the share of robots going to non-auto companies grew further in 2021.
Some of the fastest growth in robot orders is in the metals and food and consumer goods industries, according to A3.
E-commerce is another fast growth sector. At DCL, which has five U.S. fulfillment centers and will soon open a sixth, the lines that have gotten robots can operate with fewer people - yet produce 200% more, according to Tu.
""We still have employees working around the robots,"" he added, ""but we can reduce labor by roughly half.""
(Graphic: Unemployed to job openings More jobs than jobseekers: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/JOBS/egvbkmeoepq/chart.png)
BRING ON THE 'COBOTS'
The A3 data mostly tracks orders for traditional industrial robots - large systems that typically replace an entire section of an assembly line with moving arms. But a growing share of robots are a new breed of ""cobots,"" designed to work alongside humans on assembly lines.
""The number one driver for automation is the labor shortage in manufacturing,"" said Joe Campbell, a senior manager for applications development at Universal Robots, a unit of Massachusetts-based Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) Inc, which specializes in cobots. And the pandemic is not the only factor driving the change. Universal estimates 2,000 Baby Boomers are retiring daily in manufacturing, robbing factory floors of veteran expertise.
Campbell said cobots are making inroads into many industries that long resisted automation. In construction, for instance, the company has sold robot arms to a firm that uses them to install drywall in large building projects: a notoriously labor-intensive process.
Auto plants are also finding new uses for cobots. Stellantis N.V., the Dutch automaker, is now using Universal's cobots in the final assembly area of its factory in Turin, Italy, to help produce the new Fiat 500 electric vehicle. The arms are attached to a framework that moves over the car, where they locate and fasten nuts, said Campbell.
While auto plants have used robots for decades to do jobs like weld metal, he said, it is ""very new"" for cobots to do final assembly jobs.
Last week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said his engineers would launch a humanoid robot called Optimus in its factories next year. In the short term, Musk said these robots might carry items around a factory and could eventually address labor shortages.

As of December, U.S. employers had 10.9 million vacant positions, nominally below the record 11.1 million from earlier in 2021. There are now an unprecedented 1.7 open jobs for every unemployed worker, and at least one policymaker at the Federal Reserve - St. Louis Fed President James Bullard - sees the U.S. unemployment rate dropping below 3% this year for the first time since the 1950s.
""Never say never,"" said Universal Robots' Campbell, ""but I don't see anything to slow us down.""

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 06:17AM ET</span>",Vodafone chasing deals to deliver for long-suffering investors,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) is pursuing mergers with rivals in multiple European markets, spurred on by more favourable signals from regulators who have realised the value of network investment during the pandemic, Chief Executive Nick Read said.
""We are approaching consolidation with speed and resolve,"" he told reporters after Vodafone reported third-quarter numbers. 
""We are active on a number of fronts and we are seeing good engagement from our counterparties which confirms that we have a series of potential opportunities to shape the business with stronger assets in healthier markets."" 
The telecoms group, which has been targeted by activist investor Cevian Capital, sees opportunities in Spain, Italy, Britain and Portugal, Read said.
Other parties would have to be pragmatic and realistic on valuation, he said, if deals were to happen. ""We will be realistic on the valuation of our business.""
Reuters reported earlier this month that Vodafone and Iliad were discussing a tie-up in Italy.
A report in Spain on Wednesday said it was talking to MasMovil there, and other reports have previously linked the British company with Hutchison's Three in its home market. 
Read said an industrial merger with a like-minded operator such as Orange or Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) would be the ""ideal option"" for the Vantage Towers business he spun out last year.
If that didn't materialise, there were other options such as a combinations with a tower company, he said.
Read declined to confirm that Cevian was on the register, but he said he had been talking about consolidation ""for years"". 
""The important moment was COVID, which we've been dealing with for over two years, in terms of setting a different dialogue with policy makers,"" he said.
Vodafone reported a 2.7% rise in third-quarter group service revenue, described by Read as ""solid"".
But there was no respite from intense competition in Spain, where it lost 53,000 mobile contract and 50,000 broadband customers, and in Italy, which recorded an eighth consecutive quarter of decline. 

Shares in Vodafone, which are trading at the same level as 12 months ago, were 3.4% higher by 1043 GMT.
Read said Vodafone was ""firmly on track"" to meet its full-year expectations of 15.2 billion to 15.4 billion euros in adjusted core earnings and at least 5.3 billion euros of free cash flow.

Investing.com – AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD) stock surged 11.2% in premarket trading Wednesday after a strong annual revenue forecast, built on strong demand for its server chips.
For the full year 2022, AMD expects revenue to touch nearly $21.5 billion, a rise of 31%. Less than half of the 68% growth in 2021, the outlook still reflects solid momentum at the chip-making firm that just five years back trailed Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) by a wide margin on most parameters.
It's expecting 2022 gross margin to be 51%, higher by 3 percentage points from a year ago at a time when most feel chipmakers have already squeezed out the most in operating efficiencies.  
AMD’s fourth-quarter revenue jumped 49% to $4.8 billion, a record driven by demand from Cloud customers.
Revenue at AMD’s enterprise, embedded and semi-custom unit rose 75%. The company attributed this to strong demand from makers of gaming consoles, an emerging business for the company where it competes with Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Computing and graphics segment reported a 32% jump in revenue on higher average selling prices for chips and strong demand for premium desktop and notebook PCs built with its Ryzen 5000 processors.
Adjusted profit per share was 92 cents, up 72%.
For the ongoing quarter, the company is projecting revenue of around $5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range with gross margin at around 50.5%, 1.5 percentage points lower than's Intel's forecast.  "

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Novartis expects sales and core operating profit to rise around 5% this year, below some analysts' expectations, as the Swiss drugmaker weighs up interest in its generics business Sandoz from potential suitors.
The pharmaceuticals company raised the prospect in October of divesting Sandoz after years of revamping it, as price pressures mount in the off-patent drug sector.
Alongside quarterly results on Wednesday, Novartis reiterated it would give an update on the matter by the end of 2022 and that it could still retain the business.
Media reports have cited interest from private equity firms in particular, and a potential valuation of around $25 billion. Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has also flagged interest from various suitors.
He said on Wednesday all options were on the table. 
""We don’t have a bias towards any of these options at the moment. We are doing the work to finish the carve-out financials to provide that to relevant parties and we’ll see what proposals come back,"" he said. 
Finance chief Harry Kirsch added significant progress was unlikely to be announced before the third or fourth quarter.
Core operating income for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 9% to $3.8 billion, as higher drug sales offset in increase in marketing and development costs.
But Novartis shares were down 2.4% to 79.20 Swiss francs at 0933 GMT, erasing gains in the previous three trading sessions, as analysts at Third Bridge and Zuercher Kantonalbank said the 2022 guidance for ""mid single digit"" growth in sales and core operating profit was slightly short of some expectations. 
Quarterly revenues from arthritis and psoriasis drug Cosentyx gained 13% to $1.24 billion, slightly below analysts' average forecast of $1.3 billion, based on Refinitiv data.
Revenues from heart failure treatment Entresto jumped 34% to $949 million, broadly in line with the market consensus.
Novartis forecast Sandoz sales would be broadly in line with 2021's $2.5 billion, while the division's core operating income was expected to fall at a low-to-mid single-digit rate.
Despite plans to buy back up to $15 billion worth of shares by the end of next year, Novartis has said it would retain enough spending power to buy companies and technologies, back its own research efforts and pay attractive dividends.

It proposed raising its dividend 3.3% to 3.10 francs per share, the 25th consecutive increase since its creation.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's biggest lenders on Wednesday all sounded alarm about the risk the Omicron variant could have on their earnings, reviving concerns that a resurgent pandemic could trigger more bad loans.
It was a sobering assessment from Japan's three top banks - some of the world's biggest lenders by assets - and underscored how the latest coronavirus variant could put more downward pressure on an already fragile domestic economy.
Top lender Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc kept its full-year net profit outlook at 1.05 trillion yen ($9.16 billion), even though its third-quarter profit rose 40% from a year earlier, bringing the nine-month total to 1.07 trillion yen.
The annual forecast compared with the 1.08 trillion yen average of 11 analysts' estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
""With chip shortages affecting supply chains and the Omicron outbreak clouding the economic outlook, we will need to consider possibilities of booking provisions in a forward-looking manner,"" an MUFG spokesperson said at a briefing.
Banks' earnings were inflated over the last few quarters by the release of cash from provisions that had been set aside to deal with a potential flood of pandemic-related bad loans, as government subsidies kept many businesses afloat.
But the third quarter saw no such boost.
Credit costs at the major banks turned up from the previous quarter, with provisions booked for some large borrowers amid concerns that the Omicron outbreak could cool down the economy's budding consumption-led recovery.
Tokyo's new COVID-19 cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dimming hopes that an Omicron-fuelled wave of infections is peaking out. The capital and most of Japan are now under curbs to contain the spread of the virus.
Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc, the country's second-largest bank, reported a third-quarter net profit of 168.7 billion yen, up 3% from a year earlier.
Net profit at Mizuho Financial Group Inc, the country's No. 3 lender, dropped 33% to 93.0 billion yen for the three months through December.
Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho both maintained their full-year profit forecasts.
The banks also cited risks related to tighter U.S. monetary policy, with the Federal Reserve expected to start raising interest rates from March.

""We'll be carefully managing our foreign bond portfolio, as we now see larger downside risks to the economy from faster tightening,"" a Mizuho spokesperson said at a briefing.

Investing.com – Starbucks stock (NASDAQ:SBUX) traded 2.7% lower in premarket Wednesday after increasing cost pressure led the coffee-brewer to project a sharper decline in earnings this year.
The company now sees earnings per share falling 4%-6% for the year compared to its previous projection of no more than 4%.
The revised outlook follows first-quarter results that fell short of estimates, hit by surging costs in a tight market for labor and materials. The company is raising its wages this year across the U.S. to $17 an hour, one among many retailers to be doing so in their struggle to retain staff.
International same-store sales fell 3%, reflecting a 14% drop in China where the administration in several cities curbed movement to contain the pandemic ahead of the Winter Olympics, which start on Friday. The company said value-added tax exemptions in the mainland a year earlier trimmed the number by about 4 percentage points. Average ticket sales fell too in China.
North America and U.S. comparable store sales increased 18%, due to higher traffic at outlets and bigger orders from customers.
The company reiterated its projection for annual consolidated revenue to be around $32.75 billion, which would represent a rise of just under 13% from 2021.
First-quarter revenue rose 19% to exceed $8 billion, driven by holiday demand, reopening of economies and more stores. Comparable store sales were up 13%. Adjusted EPS rose 18% to 72 cents.
The company opened 484 net new stores during the quarter, closing the period with 34,317 units. China accounted for more than one in seven of those.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shares in Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) rose more than 3% on Wednesday after the Danish drug developer delivered a better-than-expected earnings outlook for 2022 despite missing fourth quarter operating profit expectations. 
The world's largest diabetes drug developer expects to generate sales growth of between 6% and 10% in local currencies in 2022 and deliver operating profit growth of 4% to 8%.
""This reflects an underlying unchanged positive growth momentum for Novo Nordisk,"" Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft told Reuters, adding that he would be raising his estimates.
Jefferies analysts said Novo's operating profit forecast reflected lower margin pressure than feared. 
Novo reported fourth quarter operating profit of 13.63 billion Danish crowns ($2.06 billion), an increase of 16% over the corresponding period last year, but below an average of 14.36 billion forecast by analysts in a Refinitiv poll. 
Higher sales and distribution costs in addition to higher research and development spending had impacted the results, Lontoft said. 
""It reflects perhaps a more normalized world with increasing absence of restrictions and COVID-19, which has led to increased marketing spending,"" he added. 
Sales for the fourth quarter, however, came in at 38.3 billion crowns, above analysts' estimates of 37.9 billion, driven by sales of new diabetes drug, Ozempic, which rose 64% to 33.7 billion in 2021.
OVERCOMING SUPPLY ISSUES 
Novo was overwhelmed by the demand for its Wegovy obesity drug following its release to the U.S. market in June, leading to product shortages.
In December, a contract manufacturer halted deliveries and manufacturing temporarily after issues relating to good manufacturing practice 
""Since December, we have worked hard to optimise our internal capacity,"" Chief Executive Lars Joergensen told reporters on Wednesday. 
""Consequently, we now expect that internal capacity in the first half of 2022 will be close to the demand of around 20,000 weekly total scripts as seen in the U.S. market at the end of 2021,"" Joergensen added. 
The supply issues impacted fourth quarter obesity drug sales, which came in below analysts' expectations despite a 55% sales growth. 

Shares in Novo Nordisk traded up 3.5% at 0829 GMT.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 04:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive-In heated meeting, India seeks tougher action from U.S. tech giants on fake news","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian officials have held heated discussions with Google, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for not proactively removing what they described as fake news on their platforms, sources told Reuters, the government's latest altercation with Big Tech.
The officials, from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B), strongly criticised the companies and said their inaction on fake news was forcing the Indian government to order content takedowns, which in turn drew international criticism that authorities were suppressing free expression, two sources said.
The sources, who were familiar with the proceedings at the virtual meeting on Monday, described the conversation as tense and heated, signalling a new low in ties between American tech giants and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration.
The officials did not issue any ultimatum to the companies at the meeting, the sources said. The government has been tightening tech sector regulations but wants companies to do more on content moderation.
The meeting was a follow-up to the I&B ministry's use of ""emergency powers"" in December and January to order the blocking of 55 channels on Google's YouTube platform, and some Twitter and Facebook accounts
The government had said the channels were promoting ""fake news"" or ""anti-India"" content and that the disinformation was being spread by accounts based in neighbouring Pakistan.
The I&B ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting, which was also attended by Indian content-sharing platforms ShareChat and Koo, which have millions of users in the country.
Facebook, now known as Meta, Twitter and ShareChat declined comment.
Without commenting on the meeting, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said in a statement it reviews government’s requests and “where appropriate, we restrict or remove content in keeping with local laws.” Koo said it complies with local laws and has strong content moderation practices in place.
In its transparency reports, Twitter has said the Indian government makes among the highest number of requests to remove content from its platform. Technology website Comparitech in October said India made 97,631 content removal requests in 2020, the second-highest in the world after Russia, mostly to Facebook and Google.
STRAINED TIES
During the meeting, senior tech executives told the officials that they take adequate measures to remove or curb the spread of misinformation on their platforms, and act on legally-valid content removal requests, said the sources.
The officials told Google to review its internal guidelines to remove fake content automatically, said the sources.
The officials also said the government was disappointed that big social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, weren't detecting and removing such content on their own.
Instead, the government was forced to order takedowns, opening it to criticism and damaging its public image, the officials said during the meeting, according to the sources.
Executives from Google told the I&B officials that one way to resolve that was for the ministry to avoid making takedown decisions public. The firms could work with the government and act on the alleged fake content, which could be a win-win for both sides, Google said, according to one of the sources.
The idea was summarily rejected by the government officials, who said the takedowns also publicise how the companies weren't doing enough to tackle fake news on their own, the person said.
While ordering takedowns of certain online accounts in January, the government said it was doing so to ""secure the overall information environment in India"", adding that such fake content was on ""sensitive subjects"" such as the Indian Army, India's foreign relations and local state elections.
Digital rights advocates say such government orders curb free speech and set a worrying precedent.

""Detailed takedown orders are not made public by the government,"" said Apar Gupta, the executive director at Internet Freedom Foundation, adding that the basis for the action was not explained.
This allowed authorities to censor content even if it does not violate public order or the security of the state, he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, continuing the strong start to the new month, helped by impressive quarterly earnings from U.S. tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
By 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.3%, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 0.7%.
Market gains in Europe are consistent with the positive momentum seen globally as investors attempt a comeback after a dismal January, when the Stoxx 600 index dropped almost 4%. That was its worst month since October 2020.
Spectacular fourth-quarter earnings from Google parent Alphabet, released late Tuesday, set the tone Wednesday. The company reported record quarterly sales as its internet advertising business surged on consumers using Google search and advertisers lifted their marketing budgets.
The corporate news has also largely been positive in Europe.
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) stock climbed 2.9% after the telecommunications company said it was on track to meet its full-year guidance, reporting a 2.7% rise in third-quarter group service revenue. It enjoyed growth in both Europe and Africa.
Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock rose 3.1% after the Danish drug developer said it aims to generate sales growth of between 6% and 10% in local currencies in 2022.
Santander (MC:SAN) reported a surge in fourth-quarter net profit, but its stock fell 1.1% as the Spanish bank relied on lower loan loss provisions for its positive results, comparing unfavorably with some of its regional rivals.
 Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock fell 1.3% after the Swiss drugmaker’s CEO said it hasn't ruled out keeping its off-patent drugs unit Sandoz. This follows a Bloomberg report released late Tuesday saying that private equity firms Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) were in talks about potentially jointly bidding for the unit.
Elsewhere, Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock soared over 7% after Credit Suisse lifted its investment stance on the U.K. online supermarket all the way to “outperform” from “underperform”. The stock, an early pandemic winner, had fallen over 50% from its peak in January 2021 as of Monday's close.
Away from the earnings season, investors will be keeping a cautious eye on developments in Eastern Europe, with the West continuing to threaten hard-hitting sanctions if Russia decides to invade Ukraine and the Kremlin denying it plans to do so.
Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank (VIE:RBIV) on Wednesday became the first large European lender to say it’s setting aside money to deal with the potential fallout from the crisis.
The main data release in Europe will be the annual CPI number for the Eurozone. This is expected to fall back to 4.4% in January from 5.0% in December, providing some relief for the European Central Bank. 
Oil prices traded higher Wednesday, climbing towards last week’s seven-year highs after a drop in U.S. stockpiles suggested continued demand in the world’s largest energy consumer.
The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories fell by 1.65 million barrels last week, compared with an expected increase of 1.5 million barrels.
Attention will turn later in the session to the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to discuss future production levels, as well as the release of the official U.S. inventory levels from the Energy Information Administration.
By 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $88.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $89.42. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 at the end of last week.  
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,798.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1288.

Investing.com –  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock surged 10% in premarket Wednesday after the Google parent reported a 32% jump in its fourth-quarter revenue, profiting from sustained high demand for its search, Cloud and YouTube services.
Both revenue and earnings easily surpassed estimates.
Total revenuet topped $75 billion, a new record, as corporates and individuals spent heavily on online advertising, shopping and entertainment.
Revenue growth was slower in percentage terms sequentially, reflecting a slight cooling off in online activity as the reopening of economies after nearly two years of the pandemic started to lure people away from their various online devices.  
Adding to the gains in the stock was the company’s decision to go for a 20-for-one stock split to appeal to a wider set of investors. A stock split doesn’t change anything fundamentally for the stock but makes it easier for small investors to hold the stock directly. A low share price thus helps in bringing more buyers to the stock. For the same reason, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) AAPL and Tesla TSLA split their shares in 2020.
Advertising sales, which include Search and YouTube, rose by a third to exceed $61 billion. YouTube ads contributed $8.6 billion to it. The video platform now records 15 billion views daily, the company said.
Google Cloud, a focus area for the company where it trails Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) by a margin, grew 45% to $5.5 billion.  
Operating margin for the company expanded by 1% percentage from a year ago to 29% but was down 3 percentage points from the third quarter.
Net profit jumped 36% to near $21 billion and was boosted by changes to the depreciation method applied to its servers and network equipment.

After tracking a robust recovery from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic through much of 2021, Nordic economies hit a bump in the road at the back end of the year because of the Omicron coronavirus variant and related restrictions.
""It was a quarter with a stable underlying business,"" Swedbank CEO Jens Henriksson told reporters.
""At the same time, it was a quarter marked by the pandemic and we are currently seeing high sickness rates among our employees.""
Pandemic curbs are already being eased in some markets, limiting the damage to economies also battling resurgent inflation that has put interest rates on an upward trajectory for the first time in years.
Sweden's oldest retail bank reported fourth-quarter operating profit down 3.4% year on year at 5.97 billion Swedish crowns ($644.93 million), slightly lower than the 6.10 billion crowns forecast by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.
Shares in the bank were down 4.2% at 0857 GMT, underperforming a 0.3% gain for the European banking index.
Commission income rose by a better than expected 19% to 4.02 billion crowns, but interest income including mortgages dipped 0.3% to 6.55 billion crowns compared with analyst expectations of 6.62 billion crowns.
Analyst notes from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and JP Morgan cited the miss on interest income as a reason for the share price reaction.
Net credit impairments were positive to the tune of 67 million crowns, implying reversals of previously projected losses, but the hard-to-predict gains on financial items fell 71% on the year, dented by the lower fixed-income trading. 
Total costs for the year came in at just below a target of 20.5 billion, excluding expenses related to money-laundering investigations. The cost target is unchanged for 2022 but does not cover a newly imposed bank tax in Sweden.
As economic conditions have normalised, Swedbank has been lifting payouts to shareholders after they were put on hold at the height of the pandemic. 

Late on Tuesday the bank said it was proposing a special dividend of 2 crowns per share, taking the total proposed payout for 2021 to 11.25 crowns per share.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>",Self-charging hybrids outsell diesel in Europe for first time - ACEA,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Self-charging hybrid cars, which operate on both an internal combustion engine and a battery, outsold diesel cars in Europe for the first time in 2021, albeit by just 48 vehicles, data showed on Wednesday.
One in 11 cars sold were battery-electric, the data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed, totalling just under 880,000 vehicles.
Self-charging hybrid cars contain a battery charged by an internal combustion engine, and generally can only drive a limited distance on electric power. 
Plug-in hybrids are powered primarily by a battery charged externally and thus seen as more environmentally friendly, but are backed up by an internal combustion engine, while battery-electric cars run on the battery alone.
A total of 1,901,239 million self-charging hybrid cars were registered in the European Union throughout the year, a significant jump from the 1.1 million registered in 2020. 
Diesel registrations, which have cratered since the Dieselgate scandal in 2015, fell by a third from last year's 2.77 million to 1,901,191.
New government subsidies for low- or zero-emission vehicles that took effect as part of pandemic recovery programmes trebled sales of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicle sales in 2020 to over one million, with a roughly even split between the two types.
The plug-in hybrids are seen by carmakers as a technology of transition to fully-electric cars, but their green credentials have been criticised by environmental groups as studies have shown drivers rely more than hoped on the internal combustion engine over the battery, pushing up the vehicles' emissions.

In 2021, battery-electric vehicle sales grew by 63.1% to nearly 878,500 cars, the data showed, while plug-in hybrid sales grew 70.7% to nearly 867,100.
Petrol remained the most common fuel type but by a lower margin than last year, constituting 40% of new registrations, down from 48% in 2020.

Volvo, which has been heavily impacted by sector-wide supply-chain constraints and semiconductor shortages, warned last year that the chip shortage would continue into 2022.
The Sweden-based company said that while production had continued to improve gradually, retail deliveries were held back ""due to an increase of cars in transit"". 
""The supply situation continues to ease, but component shortages will remain a constraining factor for Volvo Cars and the auto industry,"" Volvo said in a statement.
Global sales at the car manufacturer fell to 47,561 cars in January, with sales in Europe dropping 24.8% while they fell 12.8% in the United States.

A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
The European Central Bank's plan to start tiptoeing away from monetary stimulus may be put to the test with Wednesday's flash inflation release.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast inflation in the euro bloc rose 4.4% in January from a year earlier, easing from the previous month's record high 5%.
That inflation peak is well anticipated, so a less pronounced decline could push up both the euro and bond yields across the single currency bloc. And the ECB, meeting on Thursday, will closely watch the data as well as market moves.
Note, Monday's German inflation figures showed a bit of slowdown in January, though the print was above expectations and well above the ECB's 2% target for the euro zone as a whole.
A ratcheting up of rate-hike expectations, with almost three 10 basis point rate rises priced in by year-end, has injected life into the normally moribund short-end segment of the German bond market.
Two-year bond yields, are around -0.47% this morning -- the highest since April 2016. That's up 14 bps already this week. GRAPHIC: Rate-hike talk lifts euro, bond yields, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgjdkypb/morningbid0202.PNG 
Meanwhile, the bulls are back in force in stock markets, supported by a flurry of strong earnings. 
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc reported record quarterly sales late Tuesday. Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) just reported an eightfold rise in Q4 net profit versus the same 2020 quarter.
No surprise then, that European stock futures are up 0.5-0.6%. Futures are also pointing to a positive start for Wall Street later in the day and the VIX volatility index which rose almost to 40% on Jan. 24, closed Tuesday below 22%.
Elsewhere, oil prices headed back towards last week's seven-year highs as a draw in U.S. crude stocks confirmed strong demand and a lack of supply, but investors remained cautious ahead of an OPEC+ meeting later in the day.

(Reuters) - Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will receive $1.25 billion from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) as part of a settlement between its HIV medicines unit and the U.S.-based drugmaker, ending a long-drawn patent dispute.
The settlement, announced by GSK on Tuesday, relates to Gilead's antiretroviral drug Biktarvy, a medicine used to check the AIDS-causing virus, which GSK said in 2018 infringed on its unit ViiV Healthcare's dolutegravir and other similar compounds.
HIV medicines developed by ViiV, in which  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Japan's Shionogi also hold small stakes, are a major part of GSK's plan to support its lagging pharmaceuticals business as it readies to spin off its consumer healthcare arm.
The payment is expected to be made in the first quarter this year, London-listed GSK said. Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty until 2027 on sales of Biktarvy and on future U.S. sales of any product containing its main component.
The settlement weighed on Gilead's fourth-quarter results on Tuesday as its profit missed market expectations.
Shares of GSK were up 0.7% at 1,656p by 0821 GMT on Wednesday, while Gilead closed down 3.6% on Tuesday.
Gilead's Biktarvy, which combines three HIV medicines in a single daily tablet, poses the biggest competitive challenge for GSK's ViiV and is one of Gilead's top selling treatments, bringing in sales of $7.05 billion in 2021 from the U.S. market.
Cumulative U.S. sales of Biktarvy until 2027 are estimated to be about $50 billion, Jefferies analysts said, adding that royalties worth roughly 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) can be expected for ViiV overall. 
While Gilead is the leading supplier of HIV treatments, GSK has been working on challenging its dominance by focusing on longer-lasting treatments, like the two-drug regimen Dovato, to bring down the numbers of medicines patients have to take. 

On Tuesday, U.S. regulators expanded the use of ViiV's Cabenuva injection, taken once every two months, to include virologically suppressed adults with HIV without prior treatment failure or resistance to cabotegravir or rilpivirine.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp on Wednesday posted a larger-than-expected 44% slide in third-quarter operating profit, hit hard by rising costs for raw materials, component shortages and a drop in domestic sales for appliances.
Panasonic has sought to reduce its reliance on low-margin consumer electronics and appliances, shifting its focus to automotive batteries for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, production machinery, components and more recently supply chain management services.
That said, consumer and home appliances, which benefited from a stay-at-home sales boom during coronavirus lockdowns, still account for a big chunk of revenue.
Operating profit for the three months to Dec. 31 dropped to 73 billion yen ($636 million), far short of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 107 billion yen.
The industrial conglomerate said the profit margin at the division which houses its consumer and home appliances businesses was squeezed by rises in the cost of iron, copper and other materials. 
Other divisions that had to cope with climbs in material prices and component shortages, included its automotive business, which makes sensors and other car components, and its energy business, which has recently benefited from growing battery sales to Tesla.
Its decade-old partnership with Tesla has been yielding a profit since last year as sales of electric vehicles surged. Panasonic is set to begin supplying the U.S. automaker with a new generation of batteries that will lower EV manufacturing costs and could extend vehicle range. 
Third-quarter profit was also weighed down by a revaluation of assets and debt related to its $7.1 billion purchase last year of Blue Yonder, a U.S. company that uses machine learning to help companies connect factories to warehouses and retailers. The amount revalued was not disclosed. 
Panasonic sold its stake in Tesla for about 400 billion yen to help fund that acquisition.

Panasonic stuck with its full-year forecast for annual profit of 370 billion yen - a figure in line with analysts' forecasts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a class-action lawsuit by investors accusing  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG of conspiring to rig prices in the approximately $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.
Credit Suisse is the last bank defendant remaining in the antitrust litigation that began in 2013, after 15 others reached $2.31 billion of settlements.
U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said it was premature to accept Credit Suisse's claim that it was not part of a single global conspiracy to widen foreign exchange spreads.
But she also rejected the investors' bid to hold Credit Suisse liable, saying the question of whether there was a single conspiracy or multiple smaller conspiracies must be answered before determining whether and how Credit Suisse might have been involved.
""Questions remain about the scope of the shared illegal goal and extent of the conspirators' mutual dependence and assistance,"" Schofield wrote.
Credit Suisse said it believed it had strong defences against the claims.
""We continue to believe that Credit Suisse has strong legal and factual defences, and we look forward to establishing those at trial,"" the bank said in a statement.
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The class period runs from December 2007 to December 2013.
Investors have accused Credit Suisse traders of sharing nonpublic pricing information with traders at other banks, including in chat rooms with such names as ""Yen Cartel.""
The earlier settlements followed regulatory probes that culminated in more than $10 billion of fines for several banks, and the convictions or indictments of some traders.

Some investors including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE's Pimco chose to ""opt out"" of the investor litigation. Investors typically do that when they hope to recover more by suing on their own.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 02:06AM ET</span>","Telenor Q4 lags forecasts, sees flat to slightly higher 2022 earnings","OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Telenor said on Wednesday it expects its earnings to be largely flat or slightly higher in 2022 compared to last year, as it posted quarterly profits below forecasts.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for October-December fell 6.5% year-on-year to 11.7 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.33 billion), while analysts in a poll on average had expected 12.2 billion.
The company's overall revenue declined by 4.8% in 2021, reflecting the pending sale of its Myanmar operation, while adjusted for this it increased by 1.2%, it added.
""Entering 2022, we will maintain our focus on returning to growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Sigve Brekke said in a statement.
Expansion will come from Telenor's push into cloud and 5G technology, dubbed ""beyond connectivity"", as well as from planned tie-ups in Thailand,and Malaysia, and continued development of its Nordic infrastructure, the CEO added.
Telenor proposed a dividend of 9.30 crowns per share, compared to 9.0 crowns a year earlier and in line with analysts' median expectation in the company-provided earnings poll.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to hamper the group's revenue in Asia and the overall economic impact is most felt in Thailand, while subscription revenues in Malaysia has also taken a hit, the firm said.
The Telenor group, which has 172 million subscribers and gets about half its revenue from Asia and the rest from the Nordic region, expects ""low single digit"" growth in its organic service revenue in 2022, it added.
Capital expenditure is expected to amount to 16-17% of sales this year, it said.
Telenor last year decided to quit Myanmar following a military coup, booking a large write-off. A sale of the business is still pending final approval.

Telenor's share price has risen 5.3% year-to-date, outperforming a 0.9% decline in Norway's benchmark stock index.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 01:20AM ET</span>","Self-driving car companies zoom ahead, leaving U.S. regulators behind","By David Shepardson, Hyunjoo Jin and Joseph White
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Self-driving vehicle companies from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cruise are racing to start making money with their technology, outrunning efforts by regulators and Congress to write rules of the road for robot-driven vehicles.
On Tuesday, Cruise said that SoftBank Group Corp will invest another $1.35 billion in anticipation of Cruise launching commercial robo-taxi operations.
Cruise needs one permit, from California's Public Utilities Commission, to start charging for rides around San Francisco in vehicles with no human driver. 
Cruise, Tesla, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and Aurora Innovation Inc are among many companies aiming to deploy fully autonomous vehicle technology in the United States within the next two to three years, whether or not federal regulators give them a clear legal framework for doing so. Autonomous vehicle (AV) startups and automakers are under pressure to start generating revenue from billions of dollars of engineering investment over the past decade.
Proposed legislation to create a national framework of rules to govern autonomous vehicles remains stalled in Congress, despite the industry's lobbying. That has left autonomous vehicle companies free to deploy robo-taxis or self-driving trucks in some states, such as Arizona and Texas, but not in others. Waymo has provided thousands of rides in driverless robo-taxis in Phoenix, though the service remains limited.
""Providing guard rails is helpful, at the federal level,"" said Chris Urmson, chief executive of automated vehicle technology company Aurora Innovation. ""Today we have different regulations across the 50 states."" 
Aurora is testing its Aurora Driver in Class 8 trucks, but so far cannot operate those trucks in California without human drivers. That cuts off a potentially rich market for autonomous truck companies hauling loads from Southern California to distribution hubs to the east.
""We look at the Port of Los Angeles ... and the supply-chain challenges we see. There’s a real urgency for this technology"" to address the shortage of truck drivers, Urmson said to an audience at the Washington Auto Show last month.
AV industry lobbyist Ariel Wolf told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday that autonomous trucks ""will not lead to mass layoffs."" Instead, he said, autonomous trucks driving long-haul routes will allow human drivers to ""spend more nights in their own beds instead of in the sleeper berth of a truck."" 
PROTECTING JOBS
Unions, however, urged Congress to be skeptical.
""We are at risk ... of losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and frontline transportation jobs if Congress fails to act decisively and the AV industry is left completely unregulated,"" Transport Workers Union president John Samuelsen told the House panel Tuesday. 
Unions and trial lawyers also want autonomous vehicle companies to disclose more data about accidents and other aspects of their systems.
""All workers deserve to know that an autonomous vehicle or bot traveling next to them is safe enough to share the same road or worksite,"" said Teamsters official Doug Bloch.
In the absence of new laws tailored to automated vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees vehicle safety in the United States, has put forward voluntary guidelines and last year required companies to report accidents involving automated driving systems. 
But the agency has not issued comprehensive standards for robot-driven cars or trucks. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has the power to review new technology before it is used in aircraft. But motor vehicle manufacturers are free to certify for themselves that a feature is safe. The NHTSA steps in if new features turn out to be a safety hazard. 
NHTSA officials have intensified scrutiny of Tesla's automated driving systems over the past year. The agency on Tuesday said it had pressed Tesla to change a feature of its Full Self Driving, or FSD, automated driving system that allowed vehicles to keep moving through stop signs rather than come to a complete halt. So-called rolling stops are illegal. 
In December, NHTSA opened a review of a feature that allowed Tesla models to play videos over dashboard screens, and last August opened a formal investigation of the Autopilot driver assistance systems in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of incidents in which Teslas collided with emergency vehicles.
Still, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk made no mention of regulatory concerns during an investor call on Jan. 26 when he said the company could soon use an over-the-air software download to enable its vehicles to drive themselves and be used to offer autonomous ride services.
""I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than a human this year,"" Musk said. When Tesla enables its vehicles to drive autonomously via an over-the-air software download, Musk said, vehicle owners could offer rides that would ""cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.""

One potential path for the industry and safety advocates involves voluntary agreements on standards, said David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a vehicle safety research organization backed by the insurance industry. Harkey said the IIHS could be part of such an effort.
""We have to get to the point where it's not the Wild West,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU policymakers need to do more to attract investments in the telecoms sector if the bloc wants its economy to become more independent from global powers like Asia and the United States, a report by telecoms lobbying group ETNO said on Wednesday.
The 27-country European Union is banking on 5G to lift it out of a COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession and take the lead in internet-connected devices.
Despite investing 52.2 billion euros ($58.8 billion) in fibre cable networks and fast-speed 5G in 2020, a four-year high, the European telecoms sector still lags behind global peers, the study conducted by research firm Analysys Mason said.
In terms of capital expenditure per capita, Europe's spending stands at 96.3 euros versus 191.9 euros in the United States and 115.4 euros in South Korea, the report said.
""The increase of telecom investment and the resilience of the sector are desirable from a societal viewpoint and they are key to Europe's 'Open Strategic Autonomy' plans,"" the study said.
""Therefore, the sustainability of the sector should encourage strong policy action to dramatically improve the investment climate.""
Lise Fuhr, director general at ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Orange, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), pointed to cumbersome rules and inadequate government support.
""Despite the highest investment in years, Europe has not filled its global digital gap yet. Our sector still suffers from highly regulated revenues: we need strong policy support for faster network roll-out and for more consolidation,"" she said.

The sector has long called for easier regulatory scrutiny of consolidation in national markets and to be allowed to monetise data traffic on their networks to catch up with rivals such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 11:35PM ET</span>","Google propels record Alphabet revenue, driving shares up 8%","By Paresh Dave and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc reported record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, as its internet advertising business surged on consumers using Google search as they shopped online and advertisers upping their marketing budgets.
Alphabet's shares jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading, also rising on the company's announcement that it would undertake a 20-to-one stock split. 
The results were the latest to reinforce that the global trend toward a more digital economy has made Big Tech companies resistant to small-market shocks. While concerns about rising inflation, COVID-19 variants and supply-chain shortages have rattled Wall Street and hurt sales at some businesses, the companies that control key gateways to e-commerce https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-holiday-sales-endure-supply-chain-omicron-snags-hit-887-bln-nrf-2022-01-14, hybrid work https://www.reuters.com/business/corporate-america-revamps-back-to-office-plans-omicron-threat-2022-01-11 and streaming entertainment have not seen a dip since the early days of the pandemic.
Alphabet's sales jumped 32% to $75.3 billion in the fourth quarter, for a third straight quarterly sales record and topping the average estimate of $72 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv.
Consumers dove into Google search looking for apparel and hobbyist items, while retail, finance, entertainment and travel advertisers raised marketing budgets, Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on an earnings call. 
Analysts said Google, which generates more revenue from internet ads than any other company, is proving that its growth is unstoppable for the foreseeable future.
""The pandemic has handily accelerated the world’s reliance on digital advertising,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""Sitting through traditional TV advert breaks or reading billboards suddenly feels completely archaic in the age of streaming and mobile phone addiction.""
Shares of Alphabet rose 8.6% in after-hours trading, to $2,990.10, erasing their losses for the year-to-date. Shares of competitors in online ads including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Inc and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) all rose as well.
Under the planned 20-for-one stock split, investors as of July 1 will receive 19 additional shares for each one held. The split, which is subject to shareholder approval, will make the stock more affordable and potentially eligible for inclusion in more market indexes. 
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rallied in 2020 after splits, but increasingly brokerages such as Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets allow purchases of fractional shares, diminishing some benefit of the tactic.
BANNER YEAR
For the 2021 full year, Alphabet's sales rose 41% to a record $258 billion. Sales had grown just 13% in 2020, the slowest rate in over a decade, after advertisers slashed spending in the first few weeks of the pandemic. 
Across both 2021 and 2020, Google's advertising business, including YouTube, accounted for 81% of Alphabet's revenues.
Companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and ByteDance's TikTok have been taking small pieces of Google's share of the global advertising market. But market forecasters do not expect major slippage in Google's leading position. Google's secondary businesses, including Cloud, also have been lifting overall sales.
Google Cloud, which serves clients such as online shopping software maker Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc, increased quarterly revenue by 45% to $5.5 billion, above estimates of $5.4 billion.
The division's operating loss narrowed by 45% to $3.1 billion in 2021.
Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that Cloud is exploring how to support clients that want to use blockchain, one of several emerging technologies that proponents view as crucial to kickstarting a new era of online innovations.
Alphabet also reported a quarterly sales record during the holiday season for its Google Pixel smartphones, despite what Pichai called ""extremely challenging"" supply constraints.
Alphabet's quarterly profit was $20.6 billion, or $30.69 per share, beating expectations of $27.56 per share and marking a fourth straight quarter of record profit. The profit benefited from unrealized gains from Alphabet's investments in startups, and the company also got a $2 billion boost last year from extending the useful life of its servers and networking gear.
For the 2021 year, Alphabet's profit increased 89% to $76 billion. 
Alphabet's total costs in 2021 increased 27% to $178.9 billion as the company began to resume its pre-pandemic pace of hiring and construction. The company also noted increased legal fees, costs from a one-time bonus of $1,600 to all employees https://www.reuters.com/article/google-bonus-idCNL4N2ST4F5, and a rise in charitable contributions as it matched increased giving by employees. 
Numerous lawsuits accusing Google of anticompetitive conduct in the advertising and mobile app store markets continue to be one of the company's biggest challenges. Google already has said its efforts to lower Play app store fees to assuage some of the concerns will hurt revenue.

Alphabet's cash hoard grew by nearly $3 billion in 2021 to $139.6 billion, with another $50 billion going to buying back shares.
The operating loss for Other Bets, a unit that includes self-driving technology company Waymo and other non-Google ventures, was $5.3 billion in 2021, widening from $4.5 billion in 2020. The company offered no 2022 financial outlook for the unit.

Faraday said it had appointed Susan Swenson, currently an independent member of its board, to the newly created position of executive chairperson of the company.
The company said its chief executive officer Carsten Breitfield and founder Jia Yueting would both be handed a 25% cut each in their annual base salary. Both Breitfield and Yueting would report to the newly appointed executive chairperson, according to Faraday.
Faraday in November had delayed the filing of its quarterly report and said it had formed a special committee to review allegations of inaccurate disclosures, including claims made by short-seller J Capital. The short-seller had called Faraday ""a new EV scam in town"".
On Tuesday, Faraday said statements made by some of its employees to certain investors describing founder Jia Yueting's role within the company were inaccurate, and his involvement in the company's management post its merger with blank-check firm Property Solutions Acquisition Corp ""was more significant than what had been represented.""
However, the company maintained allegations made in the short-seller report were not supported by the evidence reviewed.
Several EV companies, including Lordstown Motors, Nikola, both of which went public via acquisitions by special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), have found themselves under investigation for mistatements by former top executives and are under the scrutiny of short-sellers.
The chairman and CEO of Electric Last Mile Solutions Inc, which also went public through a SPAC, resigned on Tuesday following an investigation into their share purchases.

Further investigation based on the special committee's findings would be under the executive chairperson's direction, Faraday said.
Faraday went public in July through a SPAC deal with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -It will likely take ""years"" to permanently address airplane interference issues caused by the deployment of 5G wireless in the C-band, a group representing major U.S. passenger and cargo carriers will tell U.S. lawmakers on Thursday.
Nick Calio, who heads Airlines for America, will tell a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee in written testimony that the 5G issues facing the aviation industry should have been avoided.
""The process that led to this operational nightmare should be held up as a cautionary tale of government communication and coordination gone awry,"" his testimony, reviewed by Reuters and not yet made public, says.
""It will likely take years, not days or weeks, to fully and permanently mitigate the interference issues caused by deployment of 5G in the C-band,"" adds Calio, whose group represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and other major carriers.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) in January agreed to delay deploying some 5G wireless towers near airports after the aviation industry and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned 5G interference can impact sensitive airplane electronics like radio altimeters. 
The FAA said last week it has cleared 20 altimeter models and approved 90% of the U.S. commercial fleet for landing in low-visibility approaches in areas with C-Band 5G. But 5G has impacted some flights in poor weather, especially some regional jets.
Aerospace Industries Association President Eric Fanning will tell lawmakers that progress is being made on the problem but it is not yet solved.
""With many outstanding questions still on the table, there are disruptions in our future, even with further compromise and collaboration,"" his testimony says.
The hearing will also feature testimony from FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, wireless industry group CTIA CEO Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Attwell Baker and others. 
A spokesman for the committee said the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was invited to testify but was unable to appear. The FCC did not immediately comment.
Baker will tell lawmakers the wireless industry ""remains confident that 5G poses no risk to air traffic safety"".

Air Line Pilots Association President Joe DePete says the FCC's support of the telecom industry has ""not only put the public at risk, but it has also forced pilots to perform extensive workarounds to ensure the safety of flight.""
Cathryn Stephens, an airport official appearing on behalf of the American Association of Airport Executives, will tell lawmakers that ""pockets of pain persist and it is clear that the reprieve may be temporary and dependent on the willingness of the telecoms to operate in a limited fashion in some areas.""

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 09:10PM ET</span>",GM prioritizes faster EV launches ahead of fatter profits,"By Joseph White and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co on Tuesday said it will spend more than the $35 billion previously planned through 2025 to speed up launches of new electric vehicles, and noted that investments in technology will take priority over richer profits next year.
GM said it expects 2022 operating profit of $13 billion to $15 billion, in line with a record 2021 operating profit of $14.3 billion, even though vehicle production is expected to increase as semiconductor supplies improve and pricing power remains strong.
""What we're doing here is essentially redeploying some of the upside earnings from the additional volume into acceleration and taking a longer-term view than just trying to maximize short-term profit,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a conference call.
GM plans annual capital spending of $9 billion to $10 billion this year and for the next several years, Jacobson said. GM is not paying a dividend. 
Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said GM is ""accelerating within the '20 to '25 timeframe from the $35 billion, but there's also some investments that we're pulling in"" that were planned later in the decade.
Barra said GM will announce the site for a fourth electric vehicle battery plant by the end of June, and will invest in a third electric truck assembly plant. The company has 110,000 reservations for the electric version of its Silverado pickup, Barra said.
Barra did not give a new figure for total EV investments through 2025. GM said in its quarterly report it expects to spend $1.5 billion more this year to speed software development and accelerate its EV portfolio.
GM's share price has fallen from its recent highs as rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co increased investments in its own electric vehicle programs, particularly the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. By contrast, GM has until now taken a more conservative approach, planning more EV launches and capacity for the latter years of the decade. 
Now, Barra and other GM executives are turning up the volume on their argument that GM has a better long-term plan, and is ready to move faster in response to growing demand for electric vehicles.
Barra said offering more affordable electric vehicles is key to the company's plans. GM will launch a $30,000 electric Chevrolet Equinox next year and is working on another, lower priced electric vehicle. 
By contrast, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk last week said the electric vehicle market leader is not working on a $25,000 electric vehicle he once promised. 
During the fourth quarter, GM built almost no electric vehicles in North America because of a battery recall that shut down production of Chevrolet Bolt EVs.
This year and next, Barra said GM plans to deliver 400,000 EVs in North America, and plans 20 electric models in North America and 30 globally by 2025.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas asked Barra during a call Tuesday if that meant GM will have a lot of low volume electric vehicles.
""We think several of those models are going to be over 100,000 units (annually) or more than that,"" Barra said. 
GM's 2022 profit outlook also reflects challenges from rising costs. GM said it expected $2.5 billion in additional logistics and commodities costs this year, and $1 billion less in profits from its financing unit. GM's added production in 2022 also will include more lower-margin vehicles, Jacobson said.
GM also will increase spending and hire 500 more staff at its Cruise robo-taxi unit, which earlier Tuesday said it will receive another $1.35 billion in investment from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp in anticipation of launching commercial ride services. 
For 2021, GM reported operating profit of $14.3 billion and net income of $10 billion. It expects 2022 net income of $9.4 billion to $10.8 billion, if there are ""no significant new economic or supply chain challenges.""
Fourth-quarter net income was $1.67 billion and operating profit was $2.8 billion. GM's net income margin in the quarter shrank to 5.2%, compared with its full-year net margin of 7.9%.

The automaker's vehicle sales and market share declined in 2021, while EBIT-adjusted margins jumped as GM focused on sales of more profitable pickups and SUVs.
GM shares dipped in after-hours trade before recovering to about $54, just above the closing price of $53.95.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Union and energy company negotiators met on Tuesday without reaching agreement on a new labor contract covering 30,000 U.S. workers at oil refineries, chemical plants and pipelines.
Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) on Monday averted a potential strike by agreeing to a 24-hour rolling extension of the existing contract a half-hour before a strike deadline. 
Tuesday's negotiations concluded with both sides agreeing to continue talks at a later date. The union on Monday rejected a 3-year deal that Marathon called its best and final offer. 
The offer was a ""comprehensive final settlement,"" said Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry. Marathon is negotiating on behalf of itself, BP (NYSE:BP),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Shell (LON:RDSa), and Valero. ""We hope the union will reconsider our offer,"" Kheiry said on Tuesday. 
At least four offers were exchanged on Monday, with the last including a 9% pay raise over the 3-year contract, people familiar with the matter said. The first offer, made last week, called for 3% over three years, the USW told members in a message last week. 
USW International President Tom Conway said on Tuesday he hoped company negotiators would recognize the risks taken by USW members who worked through the COVID-19 pandemic.
""USW members were on the front lines of the pandemic, ensuring that our nation could meet its energy needs while company executives were safely tucked away, working from home,"" Conway said in a statement.

Under the extension terms, the existing labor contract remains in place with a 24-hour notice required by either side to end it. The existing 3-year contract, negotiated in 2019, provided an 11% pay increase over three years. 
If a strike is called, it likely will follow the pattern of the 2015 work stoppage, which began on Feb. 1 of that year and expanded to 12 refineries, accounting for a fifth of U.S. crude oil processing capacity, and three chemical plants.

Coronavirus vaccines for children younger than 5 could be available as soon as end-February under a plan that would lead to the potential authorization of a two-shot regimen in the coming weeks, the Post reported, citing people briefed on the situation.
The report says that the FDA urged the companies to submit the application so that regulators could begin reviewing the two-shot data.
""The idea is, let's go ahead and start the review of two doses,"" the report quoted one of the people familiar with the situation as saying. ""If the data holds up in the submission, you could start kids on their primary baseline months earlier than if you don't do anything until the third-dose data comes in.""
Pfizer, BioNTech and the FDA did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Pfizer said in January it expected the latest results from a clinical trial for kids under the age of 5 by April, after it amended its study to give a third dose to everybody who's less than five at least eight weeks after their last vaccination.
The company amended the study because children between the ages of 2 and 4 who were given two 3-microgram doses of the vaccine did not have the same immune response that a larger dose of the vaccine generated in older children.

(Reuters) - All three Wall Street benchmarks advanced on Tuesday and the energy index closed at a multi-year high, although seesaw trading reflected investor uncertainty about how to play the current market.
Recent sessions have been choppy, as the prospect of an aggressive rate-hike campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve looms large and investors seek to position themselves accordingly - a task not made easy by lingering pandemic influences on the economy and geopolitical tension in Europe.
But despite losing 5.3% and 3.3% in January respectively, the S&P 500 and the Dow have now recorded three straight days of gains, with the Nasdaq - which dropped 8.99% in the first month of 2022 - posting four positive sessions in the last five.
It did not look like that would happen earlier in the session, when all three benchmarks traded lower in the wake of data from the Labor Department and the ISM's purchasing managers' index (PMI).
""You're starting to see that there are a lot of investors who are concerned about valuations going forward, but there are others who are worried about growth, so it seems the wall of worry keeps on growing as the economy exits this pandemic,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday it may be appropriate for the U.S. central bank to raise rates four times this year, while Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said the Fed needs to act ""soon"" to control inflation expectations.
Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year, with some Wall Street analysts expecting seven hikes.
""This will be the year when Fed will pull back support ... the markets will not be on steroids anymore and may go through a phase of detox,"" said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.
Geopolitical tensions added to market volatility, with Ukraine's president signing a decree to boost his armed forces by 100,000 troops over three years, as European leaders lined up to back him in a standoff with Russia and the United States demanded immediate Russian de-escalation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.38 points, or 0.78%, to 35,405.24, the S&P 500 gained 30.99 points, or 0.69%, to 4,546.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 106.12 points, or 0.75%, to 14,346.00.
Once again, energy led the major S&P sectors, gaining 3.5% to close at a multi-year high. The index is, by far, the best performer in 2022, up 23.2%, as U.S. crude hovers near a seven-year high. [O/R]
Those strong energy prices helped  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) to post its biggest quarterly profit in seven years on Tuesday. Its stock jumped 6.4% as a result, to close above the $80-per-share mark for the first time since April 2019. 
As of Tuesday, 184 S&P 500 companies posted quarterly results, of which 78.8% reported earnings above analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc rose 1.7% ahead of quarterly results published after the bell. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are also on deck later this week.
Of those which reported earlier on Tuesday,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) jumped 14.1% - its biggest one-day gain in 18 months - after projecting 2022 revenue above market expectations.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) dropped 4.2% after saying it will spin off WarnerMedia in a $43 billion transaction to merge its media properties with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc and also cut its dividend by nearly half.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 07:51PM ET</span>",Former U.S. security officials urge Congress to act on China legislation,"By Michael Martina
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -More than a dozen former senior U.S. national security officials have pressed congressional leaders to quickly pass legislation to boost technology funding, calling it ""critical"" to compete against China. 
A letter signed by 16 officials from past Democratic and Republican administrations - including Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, and President George W. Bush's national security advisor Stephen Hadley - said the legislation would ""ensure the U.S. stays on the cutting-edge of microelectronics.""
The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, including $52 billion for the semiconductor industry and authorizing $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The House of Representatives began considering its ""America Competes"" act this week. If it passes, the two chambers will have to resolve differences with the Senate bill.
""This is the time to prioritize comprehensive, bipartisan competitiveness legislation, which will ensure that federal investment matches our national security interests and allows the United States to maintain strengths and comparative advantages against rising adversaries,"" the officials wrote in the letter dated Feb. 1, seen by Reuters.
The letter was addressed to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as Republican House and Senate leaders Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell.
Former CIA directors John Brennan and Michael Hayden, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, deputy national security advisor in the Trump administration Matthew Pottinger, and under secretary of defense for policy during the Obama administration Michele Flournoy also signed it. 
Signers also included former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) chief executive Eric Schmidt, who served on a government artificial intelligence commission, and Jane Harman, a former ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. 
More than 500 amendments to the House bill have been submitted, including one that would bar semiconductor firms receiving government subsidies from paying dividends or repurchasing company stock.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said it was pleased the House had begun to consider its version of the bill, and the largest U.S. labor organization said on Monday it strongly supported the House legislation.

Keith Krach, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment during the Trump administration, who also signed the letter, told Reuters passage of the legislation would bring significant onshoring of semiconductor technology.
""It would do so much to rally high tech companies in the U.S., and it would do a lot around the world to show we're serious about working together,"" he said.

(Reuters) -United Parcel Service Inc projected 2022 revenue above market expectations and doled out its biggest dividend boost on Tuesday, as the logistics giant posted record annual earnings on the back of a pandemic-driven surge in online shopping and labor shortages. 
UPS stock jumped 16% to a record high of $233.72 a share, as the company capped 2021 with double-digit revenue growth across all units and consolidated operating margins touching 14-year highs. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Carol Tome, who took charge in June 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic raged, the world's largest parcel delivery service adopted a ""better, not bigger"" strategy. 
It prioritized lucrative deliveries over volume and courted customers generating more revenue and profits, such as healthcare companies and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
""2021 was an outstanding year for UPS,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. 
Average daily volumes with SMBs grew 18% in the United States despite higher prices, while business with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) - its largest customer - also notched a healthy jump.
The e-commerce behemoth's contribution to UPS' total revenue rose to 11.7% in 2021, above pre-pandemic levels, even as concerns lingered over Amazon's development of its own logistics network.
""We have a great relationship with Amazon, and we have mutually agreed about the volume that we should take and the volume that they should keep that works best for both companies,"" Tome said. 
Much like other industries, UPS and rival FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) have been grappling with supply chain challenges and rising Omicron variant cases among their staff. 
FedEx said on Tuesday that it was suspending its domestic express freight services due to COVID-19 cases. UPS said on its earnings call that it had cut staff and returned rental equipment at the tail end of the fourth quarter as COVID cases rose and package volumes decreased. 
However, UPS managed to expand operating margins to 13.5% in 2021. It expects to increase that to 13.7% in 2022, a year earlier than anticipated, helped by lowering costs through automation and higher volumes.
""UPS has emphasized the 'better not bigger' concept, which is what they seemed to have put in practice at the end of Q4,"" said Patrick Donnelly, a senior analyst at Third Bridge Group. ""FedEx, now having taken a similar approach, should begin to see margins grow as a result as well.""
Atlanta based-UPS hiked its quarterly dividend by 49% year-over-year to $1.52 per share.

The company in 2022 expects to spend $5.5 billion, with 60% of the amount earmarked for growth projects such as adding radio-frequency identification, or RFID, tags on packages and purchasing electric vehicles, and 40% toward fleet maintenance.
It also forecast a 2022 revenue of about $102 billion, above the Refinitiv-IBES estimate of $100 billion.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 07:10PM ET</span>","Drug distributors, J&J to pay $590 million to settle U.S. tribes' opioid claims","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - The three largest U.S. drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have agreed to pay $590 million to resolve claims by hundreds of Native American tribes that the companies fueled an opioid epidemic in their communities.
Tuesday's deal came after the distributors, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), along with J&J last year proposed paying up to $26 billion to resolve similar claims by states and local governments.
That proposed settlement, though, did not resolve lawsuits and potential claims by the country's 574 federally recognized Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages, which experienced disproportionately high rates of opioid overdoses.
Under Tuesday's settlement, the three distributors will pay nearly $440 million over seven years. That is on top a $75 million settlement they reached in September with the Cherokee Nation.
J&J agreed to pay $150 million over two years, according to a court filing in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, funds the drugmaker said will be deducted from its $5 billion portion of the $26 billion settlement.
""We're not solving the opioid crisis with the settlement, but we are getting critical resources to tribal communities to address the crisis,"" Steven Skikos, a lawyer for the tribes, said during a telephonic court hearing.
J&J said it did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement and that its actions promoting prescription opioid pain medications were ""appropriate and responsible.""
AmerisourceBergen said the deal will ""expedite the flow of resources to communities impacted by the crisis."" Thomas Perrelli, McKesson's lawyer, told the court the distributors would work to help tribes sign onto the settlement.
Cardinal Health had no comment. The distributors deny wrongdoing.
More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed largely by state, local and tribal governments seeking to hold those and other companies responsible for an opioid abuse epidemic that led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the last two decades.
The lawsuits accuse the distributors of lax controls that allowed addictive painkillers to be diverted into illegal channels, and drugmakers including J&J of downplaying the addiction risk in their opioid marketing.
At least 85% of the funds from Tuesday's settlement must be spent on drug treatment and related programs.
For the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe in Washington state, any money the 550-citizen tribe receives will go toward a $17 million treatment center it is developing, said Ron Allen, the tribal chairman.
""The opiate and substance abuse issues, along with alcoholism, have been very problematic for all of us,"" he said.

The deal came a week after the bigger $26 billion settlement reached a crucial milestone, as most eligible local governments in participating states agreed to join it. Five states have not settled with some or all of the four companies.
A federal judge in West Virginia is considering whether to hold the three distributors liable for fueling the epidemic in communities there, and Washington state is seeking $95 billion from them in an ongoing trial.

(Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices Inc forecast 2022 revenue above expectations on Tuesday, driving its shares up as much as 11% in after-hours trading, as stellar demand for its chips used in data center servers is expected to continue to drive growth.
""Relative to the growth from the different businesses, the growth will be led by server,"" Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told analysts on a conference call, adding that the server business would be ""very strong"" this year. 
AMD's strong forecast also boosted shares of chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
The chip designer posted record fourth-quarter revenue, surpassing estimates, as it sold more chips priced at the higher end. 
AMD has dived deeper into the data center market to capitalize on booming cloud adoption, while its agile model of outsourced manufacturing has helped the company pry away market share from rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). 
""AMD is clearly gaining market share in both the PC client and the server/datacenter end-markets against Intel,"" said Kinngai Chan, managing director and senior research analyst for semiconductors at Summit Insights Group. He added that AMD's market share in both those markets is still relatively low.
While shares of many chip companies rose in after-hours trading, Intel fell slightly. 
AMD has made a number of new launches with significant performance gains, including updates to its graphics processor lineup used for cloud and high-quality gaming, creating a challenge for Intel.
Signaling that supply-chain challenges may be easing, Su said the inventory was ""matched to demand"" and added that the company had made significant investments to ensure ongoing capacity expansion.
For the full year, AMD forecast revenue of about $21.5 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $19.27 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The California-based company reported adjusted fourth-quarter revenue of $4.83 billion, compared with estimates of $4.53 billion. 
Net income fell to $974 million from $1.78 billion last year. Excluding items, AMD earned 92 cents per share, surpassing estimates of 76 cents.

(Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc on Tuesday forecast first-quarter revenue and profit well below expectations, as it prepares to take a hit from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s ongoing move to ditch its payments services, sending its shares down 17.4%.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s operating agreement with eBay has ended and the online marketplace's transition to its own payments platform is impacting transaction volumes.
EBay's transition is expected to put $600 million of revenue pressure in the first half of this year, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said on a conference call with analysts.
""In the second half of the year, I look forward to being able to stop adjusting for eBay, and letting the strength of our core results speak for themselves,"" Schulman added.
After spending more than a decade under eBay's fold, PayPal was spun out of the e-commerce marketplace operator in 2015.
""Paypal missed on their bottom line and their guidance came in light, that's a double whammy,"" said Jeff Tomasulo, chief executive officer of Vespula Capital Management. 
""Many of these stocks have been pushed up for years and have had very high valuations, so once they start to show cracks investors bail.""
Revenue growth is expected to slow even further in the current quarter, with PayPal projecting a 6% rise, far lower than the 11.7% growth estimated by analysts, as per IBES data from Refinitiv.
PayPal processed a total of $340 billion in payments in the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier, while its peer-to-peer payment service Venmo processed a total of about $61 billion in payments. 

The San Jose, California-based company added 9.8 million net new active accounts during the past quarter, including 3.2 million accounts from the acquisition of Paidy, the Japanese buy-now-pay-later firm it bought in September.
As a result, its total revenue rose 13% to $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter and it earned $1.11 per share - with both numbers largely matching estimates.

(Reuters) - Shares of chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) got a lift in extended trade on Tuesday after Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc reported strong quarterly demand for its semiconductors, despite global supply snags.
AMD soared almost 11% after it provided an annual revenue forecast that exceeded analysts' expectations, pointing to upcoming PC, gaming and data center components.
Rival graphics chip maker Nvidia jumped over 5%, mobile chipmaker Qualcomm added over 2% and memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology climbed 1.5%. 
Industry heavyweight  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), which has lost market share to AMD in recent years as it struggles with next-generation manufacturing technology, declined almost 1% following AMD's report. 
Tuesday's after-hours surge in chip stocks is the latest in a recent bout of volatility in the sector. While growth stocks have suffered broadly from worries about rising interest rates, investors are also debating when the global chip shortage might ease, and whether companies are in danger of over-investing and getting caught in a downturn.
Following a recent drop in cryptocurrencies, prices charged by scalpers on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for PC gaming graphics cards made with AMD and Nvidia's chips are showing signs of declining following over a year of empty shelves at retailers, according to Tom's Hardware.

A quarterly report from industry bellwether Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) Inc late on Thursday may offer more clues about when the global chip shortage might abate.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has surged 8% in the past three sessions, but it remains down 13% from its record-high close in December.

The impact from the pandemic has persisted, especially across certain Asian markets like Japan, while rising Omicron infections reduced mobility in many markets from early December.
Its shares fell more than 3% in extended trading, as the owner of Hinge and OkCupid also missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates, hurt by increased competition from rival Bumble.
Match forecast total revenue growth between 15% and 20% for 2022, compared with an earlier expectation for the rate to approach 20%. 
""The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several other currencies also impacted our Q4 performance,"" the Dallas, Texas-based company said in a statement.
Match expects first-quarter revenue between $790 million and $800 million, below estimates of $835.7 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
The company also said it is focusing on the international expansion of Hinge and expects to begin launching the app in select European countries in the second quarter. 
Hoping to attract more digital users, Match has been sharpening focus on the ""metaverse"" as well, especially in the Korean market with its Hyperconnect brand. The metaverse is an online realm where people can connect through augmented or virtual reality. 

Net loss attributable to Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) shareholders came in at $168.6 million, or 60 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $149 million, or 50 cents per share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 24% to $806.1 million, missing expectations of $818.1 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global equity markets wavered on Tuesday as a new month saw investors weigh strong earnings from big-name U.S. companies against mixed economic data and inflation worries.
While U.S. job openings increased to near record highs in December, a measure of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a 14-month low in January amid an outbreak of COVID-19 infections, supporting views that economic growth lost steam at the start of the year. 
A pan-European equity index rose 1.28% while Japan's blue-chip Nikkei rose 0.28%, with MSCI's world stock index up 0.85% after hitting its highest in over a week. (T)
But U.S. indexes wavered before ending the session higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.78%, the S&P 500 gaining 0.69%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite adding 0.75%.[.N]
U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers appeared to confirm on Monday that interest rates would rise in March, but spoke cautiously about what might follow.
Australia's central bank also weighed in on Tuesday. It ended its A$275 billion ($194.40 billion) bond-buying campaign as expected, but pushed back hard on market rate-hike bets.
World markets earlier had wobbled and drifted lower as growing investor anxiety over potential U.S. central bank swifter rate-hikes seem imminent. Global equities in January had their worst month since March 2020, at the height of the initial wave of the pandemic,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) research showed. 
Money markets price roughly five quarter-point Fed rate increases this year, but the latest comments have sown some doubt.
""Investors are digesting the price action from last month.  There was a broad re-pricing of stocks and bonds as investors took note of the Fed’s hawkish pivot to raising rates more quickly from allowing the economy to run hot and leaving rates at close to zero,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
""Now that they've acknowledged that inflation is a problem, they are moving more quickly to address it.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to 57.6 last month and its lowest since November 2020.
In Asia, a number of markets, including China, were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays. 
Major bourses from London to Paris and Frankfurt were up as much as 1% with the biggest boost from Swiss lender UBS on strong fourth-quarter earnings. (EU) 
""The equity market sell-off is overdone in our view, and we reiterate our call to buy the dip, particularly in cyclicals and small caps,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note. 
OIL RETREATS 
Oil prices steadied as geopolitical tensions and tight global supplies supported the market even as some speculated that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+, might boost supplies more than expected.
Brent crude settled down 10 cents, or 0.1%, at $89.16 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 5 cents to $88.20.
After shooting higher on Monday, government borrowing costs dipped. [GVD/EUR]
The bond market sell-off that has upended financial markets since the start of the year stalled on Tuesday, with benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovering near their lowest levels in a week. 
Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, rose by some measures at their fastest pace since 2009 in January as investors began pricing in the possibility that the Fed could raise interest rates as many as five times this year.
Money markets price in two 10 basis point rates hikes by the European Central Bank by year-end, with a chance of a third move. 
That poses a potential headache for ECB policymakers meeting on Thursday since they had said rates are unlikely to rise in 2022.
In currency markets, the Australian dollar rebounded after an initial hit from the Reserve Bank of Australia's dovish message.
The dollar fell for a second straight session, after hitting a 19-month peak at the end of last week, on weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and after Fed officials pushed back against aggressive rate hikes this year, lifting risk appetite.

As the dollar eased, risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar, euro, and British pound gained. The dollar index fell 0.303%, with the euro up 0.19% to $1.1254.
Russia's rouble firmed to about 77 against the dollar, recovering further from last month's heavy sell-off caused by increased tensions between Moscow and the West.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 05:36PM ET</span>","Tesla recalls nearly 54,000 vehicles that may disobey stop signs","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will recall 53,822 U.S. vehicles with the company's Full Self-Driving (Beta) software that may allow some models to conduct ""rolling stops"" and not come to a complete stop at some intersections posing a safety risk.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the recall covers some 2016-2022 Model S and Model X, 2017-2022 Model 3, and 2020-2022 Model Y vehicles. NHTSA said the feature also known as FSD Beta may allow vehicles to travel through an all-way stop intersection without first coming to a stop.
Tesla will perform an over-the-air software update that disables the ""rolling stop"" functionality, NHTSA said. The agency added it ""maintains regular discussions with all manufacturers to discuss potential safety concerns of these types of systems.""
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) ""there were no safety issues"" with the function. ""The car simply slowed to ~2 mph & continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians,"" Musk wrote.
NHTSA noted federal law ""prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including intentional design choices that are unsafe.""
Last week, Tesla said the number of FSD beta vehicles in the United States increased to nearly 60,000 from a few thousand at the end of September. Tesla has been testing the improved version of its automated driving software on public roads, but the carmaker and the regulator have said the features do not make the cars autonomous.
Tesla said as of Jan. 27 it was not aware of any warranty claims, crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the recall.
STATE LAWS
Tesla told the auto safety agency it released on Oct. 20 an updated version to introduce the ""rolling stop"" functionality. The automaker said to use the feature vehicles must be traveling below 5.6 miles (9 km) per hour and no relevant moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection.
The feature, which appeared to violate state laws that require vehicles to come to a complete stop and required drivers to opt-in for what it dubbed ""Assertive"" mode, drew attention on social media and prompted NHTSA to raise questions with Tesla.
According to a defect report filed with the auto safety agency, Tesla said it met with NHTSA staff on Jan. 10 and Jan. 19 ""to discuss the functionality, including operating parameters"" and the automaker on Jan. 20 agreed to the recall.
In November, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 for another software update because a communication error could cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes.
NHTSA said last week it had sought additional information from Tesla in its probe into 580,000 vehicles over the automaker's decision to allow games to be played by passengers on the front center touchscreen.

In December, NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation into 2017-2022 Tesla Model 3, S, X, and Y vehicles over the vehicle's ""Passenger Play"" feature the agency said ""may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash.""
In August, NHTSA opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after about a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. That investigation also remains open.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 05:26PM ET</span>",Earnings beats underwhelm as Wall Street looks for good news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. earnings news has been less impressive this reporting season than in recent quarters, giving some investors another reason to worry after Wall Street's tumultuous start to the year. 
Disappointments from companies like  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS), which missed quarterly profit expectations, and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which gave a downbeat forecast, have added to recent pressure on stocks, while reports from a number of heavyweights are still expected.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc provided some upbeat news after the bell on Tuesday, with its shares up more than 7% as it reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. At the same time,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares sank more than 17% as the online payments company failed to match up to its pace of growth a year earlier. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc are slated to release earnings later this week.
S&P 500 companies are still beating analysts' earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021, but they are doing so by a much lower margin than over the past year when companies were just bouncing back from the depths of the pandemic.
With results in from more than 180 companies as of early Tuesday, S&P 500 companies in aggregate are reporting earnings 4.3% above expectations, well below the average of 16% for the past four full quarters but in line with the 4.1% average going back to 1994, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Estimated year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter has gone up slightly since the start of the reporting period. Growth was forecast at 25.6% as of Tuesday versus 22.3% at the start of January, based on Refinitiv data.
""It was huge beats last year and that's shrunk,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. ""It's partially reverting back to normal, but it's also the supply-chain pressures and inflationary pressures taking a toll.""
Wall Street is trying to find its footing after the recent sharp selloff. The S&P 500 had its worst January since 2009, while the Nasdaq posted its biggest January percentage drop since 2008 following increasing worries about rising interest rates.
Growth stocks like large-cap technology have been among the hardest hit, and investors are focused on whether earnings this year will be able to support the market.
While down from about 22 at the start of the year, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is at 20.1, still well above its long-term average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv DataStream.
Companies have been facing higher prices and labor costs, and some companies may be struggling to pass on those costs at this point, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Among them, Oreo cookie maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) last week said it expects to face a larger impact from supply-chain problems in its key North American segment in the current quarter.
To be sure, profit growth is seen as a positive overall for the market.
""The tug-of-war between earnings and rising interest rates continues. Earnings are trending higher, while rising interest rates are compressing valuation multiples and increasing price volatility,"" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, wrote in a recent note.

Yet just 78.8% of the reports so far this season have beaten analysts' earnings estimates, compared with an average of 84% of companies beating over the past four quarters, Refinitiv's data showed.

(Reuters) - Workers at nearly 80 King Soopers, owned by Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, approved a new three-year contract, the Colorado-based chain said on Tuesday, ending a stalemate that had caused a 10-day strike at the start of the year.
King Soopers will invest $170 million in wage increases through the life of the agreement, with additional health-care investments.
The union had planned to strike from Jan. 12 until early February for better wages and working conditions but called it off on Jan. 21 after reaching a tentative deal.
Union President Kim Cordova said the deal followed several days of negotiations and the possibility of a sympathy strike by stores in California and Seattle.
A document seen by Reuters showed per-hour raises ranged between $1.23 and $5.99 in the first year. The union said over 95% of the workers will get increases of $2 or more in the first year, with around 250 pharmacy technicians eligible for the highest bump.
The union had initially sought a raise of at least $6 in the first year of the contract for all workers, while King Soopers had proposed increases of up to $4.50 based on job classification and tenure.
""Contract negotiations always involve a give and take from both sides ... you will never have a situation where one side walks away with everything they want,"" said Helen Rella, an employment attorney at Wilk Auslander.
The deal was accepted by 99% of workers in some locations, Cordova said, adding the union ""fixed a lot of things that needed to be fixed.""
But not everyone was happy with the contract.

""The raise was definitely disappointing. My biggest gripe about the contract, though, is honestly the lack of decent wages for entry-level employees,"" said a worker who requested anonymity.
Another worker said he was let down as the union did not meet its original goal of getting a raise of $6 per hour in the first year.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 05:13PM ET</span>","Latam stocks outshine the world in January, Brazil in focus","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Latin American stocks outperformed their peers and the developed world in January and some regional currencies are among the strongest against the dollar so far in 2022, with some investors betting on more returns.
Stocks across Latin America rose 7.3% in January in dollar terms, their biggest monthly increase since May, and compare to a 5% drop in Asian stocks outside Japan, a 1.9% drop in the overall Emerging Market (EM) index and a 5.3% decline in the developed markets index.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 fell 5.3%.
""MSCI Latin America has had a great start to the year while everything else has been struggling. That was after the index dropped nearly 25% from June through November,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for multi-asset solutions at Allspring Global Investments.
He said they have been expecting the rebound in some EM stocks, including from Latin America, though ""it’s felt like waiting for a bus that is never coming.""
In local currency stock markets, the benchmark Brazilian index, down near 12% last year, rose 7% last month while Argentina added 8.9%, Peru rose 8.8% and Chile gained 5.7%.
Other than the opportunity brought by last year's stock declines, the region has also benefited from the increase in commodity prices, according to Sameer Samana, senior Global Market Strategist at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""Latin American countries are geared towards agriculture, base metals, energy, so that is probably one of the bigger factors,"" he said.
Regional currencies had also been on the back foot during most of the pandemic, but monetary policy tightening ahead of a more hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve was a tailwind for the region. The top four performing currencies last month across emerging markets came from Latin America, giving an extra boost to dollar returns.
(Graphic: Emerging market currency performance in January, https://graphics.reuters.com/LATAM-STOCKS/PERFORMANCE/gdvzyndnqpw/chart.png) 
In U.S. dollar terms, Brazil stocks added 12.9% last month, Chile gained 12.5%, Peru rose 11.8% and Colombia gained 10.6%.
Some analysts expect Brazil to stay in the lead, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) keeping its overweight in the country both in Latin America and the wider EM index, while Tellimer included the country's stocks in its February top picks citing cheap valuations both of stocks and of the real currency, boosted by a commodity price tailwind.
""A return to the 10-year median real effective exchange rate implies 35% upside to the FX rate,"" Tellimer analysts said in a note, adding that net foreign flows to Brazilian stocks turned positive last year after three years of outflows.

Others however see the move in Brazil as hard to follow through. Samana, from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said Mexico will likely do better than it has taking advantage of its proximity to the U.S. market.
""For Brazil, now that they've run up already, from here the road probably gets a little bit tougher.""

(Reuters) -Gilead Sciences Inc on Tuesday posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, citing a $1.25 billion legal settlement involving HIV drug patents and a charge related to its collaboration with  Arcus Biosciences Inc  (N:RCUS), sending the company's shares down nearly 4%.
Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 69 cents per share, down from $2.19 a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had forecast $1.60 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.
For full-year 2022, Gilead said it expects adjusted earnings of $6.20 to $6.70 per share on product sales of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion, or $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion excluding sales of its COVID-19 drug Veklury. 
The targets are short of Wall Street estimates, ""which puts a near-term damper on core business sentiment,"" said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. 
Shares of Gilead were down 3.7% at $65.80 in after hours trading.
The company said it will make a one-time $1.25 billion payment to ViiV Healthcare - an HIV company majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Shionogi & Co Ltd as shareholders. It will also pay a 3% royalty until 2027 on sales of HIV drug Biktarvy and on future U.S. sales of any product containing its main component.
Quarterly revenue fell slightly to $7.24 billion from $7.42 a year earlier, but came in ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.67 billion.
Product sales for the quarter fell 2% to $7.2 billion.
Sales of COVID-19 drug Veklury, known chemically as remdesivir, decreased 30% to $1.4 billon, but still easily surpassed the $864 million expected by analysts.
Fourth-quarter sales of Gilead's HIV medicines rose 7% to $4.5 billion. The company had said in October that sales of non-COVID treatments, particularly of its flagship HIV drugs, were hurt during the pandemic as many people avoided healthcare settings, but had started to recover.

Quarterly sales of breast cancer drug Trodelvy came in at $118 million, in line with analyst estimates of $116 million.
Yee said investor focus remains on upcoming results from a key trial of Trodelvy in patients with a specific type of breast cancer. The medication was the main driver of Gilead's $21 billion purchase of  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU) in 2020.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 04:31PM ET</span>","Spotify shares rebound after Joe Rogan apology, Citigroup upgrade","By Supantha Mukherjee, Helen Coster and Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan apologized and pledged more balance on his show amid a backlash against COVID-19 misinformation on the streaming service that wiped more than $2 billion off its market value last week.
On Monday, investors appeared to shrug off the controversy that hurt shares last week, as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s stock price jumped 12%after brokerage  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) raised the stock rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" saying the Swedish company would be able to improve its advertising business.
Spotify said it would add a content advisory to any episode with discussion of COVID to try to quell the controversy, a first step into the field of content moderation that other tech platforms have found challenging and costly.
Rogan's show, The Joe Rogan Experience, has been the most listened-to podcast on Spotify and is central to its plan to expand beyond music and take on rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a share of the podcasting market.
In a 10-minute Instagram video post on Sunday evening, Rogan apologized to Spotify for the backlash but defended inviting contentious guests.
""If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,"" Rogan said. ""I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view.""
Rogan is a prominent vaccine skeptic and his views on vaccines and government mandates to control the spread of the virus alienated prominent figures from singer-songwriter Neil Young https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/spotify-removing-neil-youngs-music-after-his-joe-rogan-ultimatum-2022-01-27 to guitarist Nils Lofgren to best-selling U.S. professor and author Brene Brown.
Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell also asked for her music to be taken off Spotify, citing a letter from hundreds of medical professionals urging the platform to prevent Rogan spreading falsehoods on the pandemic.
Spotify, which reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, has spent billions to build its podcast business and currently has over 3 million titles on its platform. Although it has an exclusive license to distribute the podcast, Rogan himself owns the show.
According to the company, it reviewed the episodes and decided that they did not meet its threshold for removal.
Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said late on Sunday that he might disagree with the views of some individuals on the platform but that it was ""important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor.""
Its new policies include adding an advisory to any pandemic-related podcast that will direct listeners to a COVID-19 hub containing information from medical and health experts, as well as links to authoritative sources.
But the task of content moderation that it has now been dragged into is very different from removing songs with copyright violations, a job that Spotify is familiar with.
PODCAST MODERATION
Social media giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have struggled with balancing the rights to free expression with moderating harmful content on their platforms amid intense regulatory scrutiny. Technology companies have invested in human content moderators as well as artificial intelligence technology over the past few years.
Under increasing pressure to police false content on their platforms, these companies have tightened their rules on vaccine misinformation. YouTube last week banned Fox News host Dan Bongino for making rule-breaking statements about the effectiveness of masks in stopping the spread of COVID.
Podcasts, which researchers have argued can be a powerful conduit for misinformation both due to their reach and the intimate relationship created with listeners, have often received less scrutiny over content moderation decisions than social media platforms. 

The challenges of monitoring and analyzing audio, coupled with the open nature of the podcasting ecosystem, has also complicated moderation. 
Research from the Brookings Institution recently showed how misinformation about voter fraud was pushed on podcasts ahead of the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, including on Steve Bannon’s ""War Room"" podcast, which was removed from Spotify in 2020 but is available on Apple and Google.

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered on Tuesday but were trying to stage a rally late in the session as investors awaited earnings from big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms this week.
Alphabet reports after tonight’s closing bell. Technology stocks in general along with growth stocks gave back some of their gains from the previous two days. 
Another big tech stock, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), was pressured after a report that the Federal Trade Commission will be reviewing its $68.7 billion deal for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and not the Justice Department. The FTC is seen as taking a skeptical view of big tech mergers.
Reuters reported that as of Monday, 172 S&P 500 companies posted fourth-quarter results and three-fourths of them beat analyst expectations. 
In addition to earnings, Tuesday data from the Labor Department showed job openings rose to 10.9 million December, beating expectations for 10.3 million. A private payroll report comes out Wednesday and the government’s jobs report comes out on Friday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Job numbers
Private job growth is likely to have decelerated to 207K in January after recording its fastest pace in seven months in December, when it rose 807K. Payroll processing firm ADP will release the data Wednesday at 8:15 AM ET.
2. Meta earnings
Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is expected to report a profit per share of $3.85 on revenue of $33.34 billion in the fourth quarter, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be listening to what it says about the outlook for ads.
3. T-Mobile earnings

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) will directly elect officers after a referendum required as part of a 2020 Justice Department settlement to resolve a corruption probe.
U.S. District Judge David Lawson in Detroit on Tuesday approved the results of the referendum and ordered the change by June, which will be in time for the next union election cycle. The union in 2020 also agreed to an independent court-appointed monitor as part of the Justice Department settlement into allegations that resulted in the convictions of two former UAW presidents, among others.
UAW officers have been elected through a delegate system rather than through direct elections. More than 63% of current and retired members voted in favor of direct elections in a secret ballot.
""We will continue to work with the monitor to ensure that the UAW is fully reformed, free of corruption and fraud, and that the union’s elections will be fair,"" said Dawn Ison, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.
Under the Justice Department consent decree, monitor Neil Barofsky has authority to exercise disciplinary powers within the UAW, investigate possible fraud or corruption and seek discipline against UAW officers and members.
Barofsky will design the new election system after consulting with the UAW.
Numerous UAW officers pleaded guilty to embezzling millions of dollars for their personal benefit, using the funds for liquor, cigars, golf outings and expensive hotel stays.

In August, FCA US, the North American operating subsidiary of Stellantis was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to making more than $3.5 million in illegal payments to UAW officers. FCA paid a $30 million fine. 
The UAW represents about 400,000 U.S. workers, including workers at Detroit’s Big Three automakers and in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of some 1.5 million.

However, he added they remain cautious about the company's ability to drive sustained revenue growth in the long term. 
Commenting on the spun-off electric motorbike brand, LiveWire, the analyst stated the spinoff removed a ""key growth lever,"" but the company has ""found a way to crystallize value for the business and is still able to share in the upside of LiveWire via its 74% stake in the entity.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter profit of $8.87 billion, its largest in seven years, as the top U.S. oil producer benefited from strong energy prices. 
The company slashed spending after fuel demand cratered two years ago. Since then, earnings have topped pre-pandemic levels, helped by the rise in oil prices, with the global oil benchmark Brent also at a seven-year high.
On Monday, Exxon disclosed a business shakeup to accelerate a $6-billion cut to operating expenses set in motion last year. 
The revamping will ""position us to lead in cash flow and earnings growth, operating performance, and the energy transition,” Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement. 
A continuation of high oil prices would ""cause us to increase the pace of the share repurchase program,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said. Exxon restarted buybacks last month after a long suspension, with pledge to buy $10 billion by the end of 2023.
(Graphic: Exxon rises to a three-year high after earnings, https://graphics.reuters.com/EXXONMOBIL-RESULTS/lgvdwxnoapo/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Shares in midday trading went up 5% to $80.02, near a three-year high. 
OIL EARNINGS JUMP
""ExxonMobil closed a tumultuous year with results that can be described as solid,"" Peter McNally, global sector lead at research firm Third Bridge.
Exxon reported an adjusted profit of $2.05 per share, 11 cents above analysts' forecast as the bottom line benefited from soaring oil and gas prices, higher volumes and asset sales. In the same quarter a year ago, Exxon posted an adjusted profit of 3 cents a share. 
Oil and gas production, Exxon's largest business, posted a $6.1 billion operating profit, the highest in two years. Earnings benefited from an 80% increase in oil prices and doubling of natural gas prices compared to 2020. 
It now plans to raise production in the top U.S. shale basin by 25% this year, in addition to a similar increase last year in the Permian, where output reached 460,000 bpd.
Even with a substantial spending increase into the end of the year to $17 billion, Exxon managed to use the extra proceeds from oil prices to reduce debt, said Biraj Borkhataria, Co-Head European Energy Research at RBC Capital Markets.
DEBT REPAID 
The company has eliminated the tab taken on during the 2020 downturn to keep paying dividends to shareholders. It has now returned to pre-pandemic debt levels, down $20 billion last year to $47.7 billion. 
""We have been cautious on the Exxon investment case through the pandemic,"" said Borkhataria. ""But we believe the overall sector tailwinds are likely to outweigh company-specific factors in 2022.""
The company had flagged gains from asset sales and a $752 million, or 17 cents a share, hit to upstream results from impairment charges. 

Its refining business posted fourth-quarter operating net of $1.4 billion, up sequentially and a big swing from a year ago when results were hurt by pandemic-related demand declines. 
Chemical operating earnings were more than twice the profit a year ago when the business was hurt by the pandemic. Exxon said on Monday it would combine its refining and chemicals businesses.

Dolev reiterated a buy rating and explained that ""monthly active users increased 6mn in 1Q and 3.6mn in 2Q, then declined by 2.4mn in 3Q. 
""However, it appears that the rate of decline in MAUs is beginning to abate. As evidence, the incremental decline in 4Q was less severe than that of the prior quarter, with MAUs declining just 1.6mn Q/Q.""

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday extended a legal shield protecting the Sackler family owners of Purdue Pharma from lawsuits to Feb. 17, as they try to reach a deal with several states to settle sprawling litigation stemming from the U.S. opioid crisis.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said allowing the legal shield to expire at the end of Tuesday would be ""quite foolish,"" given the mediator's report of a possible deal.
Purdue, maker of the highly addictive OxyContin opioid painkiller, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sacklers of fueling an American opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing.
The opioid abuse crisis has led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to U.S. data.
Members of the Sackler family have denied the allegations.
Purdue’s bankruptcy judge has paused litigation against members of the Sackler family since 2019, seeking to buy time for the company to pursue a reorganization in bankruptcy court. 
On Monday, the mediator reported that the Sacklers were nearing an agreement to boost their more than $4.3 billion cash contribution to resolve the litigation after negotiating with states that objected to the original terms.
Judge Drain said on Tuesday that ""all bets were open"" as to whether the Sacklers would continue to receive legal protection from opioid lawsuits if the current round of mediation does not result in a new deal.
If the Sacklers’ legal protection were allowed to expire, the family and Purdue would be swept up in a ""a firestorm of uncoordinated litigation"" that would destroy any value the company has left, Purdue attorney Marshall Huebner told the judge on Tuesday. 
Legal protections for the Sacklers have been a point of controversy throughout Purdue’s bankruptcy.
The current round of mediation began in January, after a U.S. district judge ruled that Purdue’s bankruptcy reorganization plan improperly shielded Sackler family members, who had not filed for Chapter 11 themselves, from opioid litigation.

Attorney Joe Rice, who represents plaintiffs who have sued Purdue and the Sackler family, said in court on Tuesday that the legal protections should be allowed to expire.
Allowing lawsuits to proceed could break a holding pattern that ""only benefits the Sackler family,"" Rice said.

Investing.com — Shares of meme stock and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) surged 14% Tuesday after the company announced fourth-quarter preliminary results. 
AMC revealed total revenue for the quarter is approximately $1.17 billion, an enormous rise from the $162.5 million recorded during the same period last year. 
The company was hit heavily by the pandemic and enforced lockdowns. However, the lifting of restrictions in the second half of 2021 and some blockbuster movie releases have pushed the company's preliminary results — which aren't official — above consensus.
The company's net loss for the period is expected to be between $194.8 million and $114.8 million, including an estimated one-time non-cash impairment charge of $50 million to $125 million. This is compared to a net loss of $946.1 million during the same period in 2020, which also included a non-cash impairment charge of $466.1 million.
“AMC’s 2021 results improved significantly as the year progressed, and we finished the year with the strongest quarter in two years,"" said Adam Aron, chairman and CEO of AMC Entertainment.
""The fourth quarter of 2021 marks a meaningful milestone with positive EBITDA of more than $145 million, positive Operating Cash Generated of more than $215 million, and a record year-ending liquidity position of $1.8 billion.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Mandatory clearing of derivatives contracts by pension funds in the European Union should start in June 2023, helping the bloc to cut reliance on London, the EU's securities watchdog said on Tuesday.
Brussels wants to reduce reliance of EU financial services companies, including pension funds, on clearing euro denominated derivatives in London after Britain left the bloc's regulatory framework. 
The mandatory clearing by the pensions funds could help to build up EU capacity in derivatives clearing. London still dominates clearing, with the London unit of clearing house LCH handling about 90% of euro denominated interest rate swaps.
EU pension funds collectively hold trillions of euros in assets for savers and use derivatives, like interest rate swaps, to manage risk exposures as their liabilities are often linked to borrowing costs.
The pension funds were given a temporary exemption from mandatory clearing in 2012 and it has remained in place ever since. Mandatory clearing was introduced after the global financial crisis over a decade ago and ensures a trade is completed, even if one side goes bust.
The pension fund sector wanted extra time to prepare for the move to mandatory clearing, which involves finding cash or margin to post against swaps in case of default.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a letter on Tuesday to the EU's financial services chief, Mairead McGuinness, that pension companies are now ""largely operationally ready"" for mandatory clearing from June 2023.
ESMA said a second clearing house inside the EU - LCH in Paris - along with Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex in Frankfurt, was now offering a service which helps pension funds to source cash for margins.
Some pension firms are voluntarily clearing trades at Eurex and the London unit of LCH, which is part of the London Stock Exchange, and most large firms can clear at both, ESMA said.

Making clearing mandatory for pension funds could be ""one of the milestones in the plan to build EU clearing capacity, as it might contribute to bring client liquidity to the EU which could then in turn attract further buy-side activity,"" ESMA said.
Brussels is due to set out ""incentives"" in coming weeks to persuade banks and asset managers to shift clearing business from the UK capital to the bloc.

Investing.com – Cabot stock (NYSE:CBT) soared more than 10% Tuesday after the specialty chemicals company raised its annual outlook following a strong first quarter.
The company expects higher pricing it is extracting from its clients under new agreements and sequential improvement in volumes in key products to drive its performance through the year. Its battery materials business, a focus area for the company, recorded a year-over-year volume growth of 58% in the first quarter.  
The company said a “top five battery manufacturer” has selected it under its new EV battery program and sales are expected to begin in the third quarter of the current financial year.
Cabot now expects its annual EPS to come in between $5.50 and $5.90, up from its November guidance of $5.20 to $5.60.
“. . .We expect demand to improve across all of our key product lines and a step up in profitability largely due to the benefit from our 2022 customer agreements. . .,” a company statement quoted President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Keohane as saying.
Net sales in the first quarter rose nearly 30%, to $968 million.
The company said it has struck a deal to acquire a plant in Tianjin, China, from Tokai Carbon Group to support growth in battery materials. The deal should close in the current quarter, according to the company. Following this, the company is also expecting its battery materials plant in China’s Xuzhou to start in the second half.
Cabot’s profit per share in the first quarter rose more than 9%, to $1.29 as a higher cost of sales ate into the revenue. "

(Reuters) - Buyout firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc is exploring a sale or an initial public offering for Optiv Security Inc, a U.S. cybersecurity solutions distributor and consultant it controls at a valuation of more than $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
KKR has held discussions with investment banks about how to cash out of Optiv, which it acquired five years ago, the sources said. A potential sale of Optiv could attract interest from other private equity firms, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential and the deliberations are preliminary and may not lead to any deal. 
Optiv generates annual revenue of about $650 million and cash flow of about $150 million, one of the sources said.
A KKR spokesperson declined to comment, while Optiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Optiv was formed in 2015 through the merger of cybersecurity firms Accuvant and FishNet Security. A major player in the security solutions space, it has grown from a technology reseller to a one-stop provider of managed security services by knitting together thousands of security products.

KKR acquired a majority stake in the Denver, Colorado-based company in 2017 from private equity firms Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, Investcorp and Sverica Capital. Media reports at the time pegged the value of that deal at nearly $2 billion, as the company reported $643.8 million in revenue on about $651 million debt in the first nine months of 2016. 
Since its acquisition by KKR, Optiv has expanded into Canada and Europe by snapping up smaller firms. It serves over 7,000 companies across industries, including 75% of the Fortune 500, according to the company's website.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 11:11AM ET</span>",Is Amazon ready to raise the price of Prime delivery? Wall Street thinks so,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - When Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday reports how it fared during the holiday quarter, a key question will be if the retailer will finally raise the price of Prime, its fast-delivery and media subscription. 
The company has every reason to do so, analysts say. Amazon had to pay higher wages and signing bonuses to attract workers in a labor shortage. It had to spend more on shipping because it could not get products into the right warehouses. Even steel for construction projects cost more.
Amazon has forecast an operating profit between $0 and $3 billion, with analysts estimating it landed at the higher end of the range, at about $2.5 billion, according to research firm FactSet. Still, analysts are expecting a price hike soon for Prime. U.S. subscribers' annual fees last went up four years ago to $119 from $99, and they went up four years before that from $79.
""It's about time,"" said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. ""Shipping costs have gone up, period.""
Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said pitching a price hike would be straightforward: fuel is more expensive, trucking is pricier, and goods themselves cost more. Subscribers - more than 200 million globally, including a majority of U.S. households - would pay more because they want fast delivery, he said. That's potentially worth billions of dollars to Amazon's bottom line.
""They have pricing power because the value proposition is so strong,"" said Mahaney.
Rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) raised its standard U.S. rate weeks ago, too.
Amazon declined to comment on Prime's pricing. In October, its CFO Brian Olsavsky said the retailer had no hike to announce, but ""we always look at that."" He cited Prime's value and the time since Amazon's last increase as points to consider.
Among the factors he did not highlight: reliability. Three people who have worked at Amazon said the company would think twice before raising rates until its operation returned to normal, pointing to some shipping delays. The company had not added a major Prime benefit recently, and it has yet to make one-day delivery the default it promised almost three years ago.
""Given all of the Q4 delivery challenges, raising the price of Prime doesn’t seem appropriate,"" said Scott Jacobson, a former senior manager at Amazon, who is now at Madrona Venture Group.
The decision also boils down to math, he said. More valuable than fees is the way Prime changes the behavior of customers, prompting them to spend more on Amazon to make the most of their membership. Would extra subscription revenue outweigh any hit to spending by those who quit?
Amazon said it has worked to minimize how the pandemic and operational difficulties have impacted customers. It said in recent years it has added Prime benefits, such as savings on drugs when paying without insurance, and it has sped up delivery while adding popular programs to stream. 
The cause of Amazon's latest challenges may come into focus in its results Thursday, stemming from a surge in demand, the ongoing labor and supply crunch, or both. The National Retail Federation has said holiday sales rose 14.1% during November and December, beating its prior forecast.
The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has surged, too, albeit at the tail end of Amazon's U.S. holiday peak.

""You’ve got to believe that Amazon got hit heavily,"" Pachter said, agreeing the company's delivery uncertainties complicated a Prime hike.
""To raise my price when I literally ordered (some) hot sauce and it took like nine days to get here, that would be a poke in the eye.""

Investing.com —  Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) and electric vehicle charging company Wallbox (NYSE:WBX) announced Tuesday they are expanding their partnership to the entire U.S.
The companies previously ran a pilot in the Bay Area that provided Uber drivers a discounted package for a Wallbox Pulsar Plus charger, installation and the option to finance the package. 
The expansion will see drivers across the U.S. have access to Wallbox's discounted EV charging package. Uber said the expansion will be rolled out in four key groups to reach nationwide coverage by the end of April, starting with Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle in January.
In addition, Uber and Wallbox are in discussions about a potential global roll-out program beginning in Europe and Canada.
As part of its aim to become a zero-emission platform in the U.S. and Canada by 2030, Uber also has a Uber program that makes drivers of fully electric vehicles eligible for an incentive, enabling them to earn an extra $1 on every Uber trip — up to $4,000 annually.

ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS on Tuesday reported its best annual profit since the global financial crisis, emboldening it to hike share buybacks and set more ambitious profit goals as it banks that more digital products will result in hefty cost-savings.
Shares in Switzerland's biggest bank surged 6.5% in early trade to a four-year high.
In its first major strategic review since Chief Executive Ralph Hamers took the helm in November 2020, UBS said it wants to use technology to help it increase revenues and reach more customers in the years ahead, while also continuing to bring costs down.
""UBS is in better shape than ever,"" Hamers said in a statement. ""We're adapting our coverage models to deliver more digital and scalable advice as well as bespoke solutions.""
It announced plans for up to $5 billion in share buybacks for this year after repurchasing $2.6 billion in 2021 and said it was proposing a dividend hike to $0.50 per share for last year from $0.37 for 2020.
Buoyed by robust trading activity from ultra-wealthy clients as well as dealmaking, UBS's net profit for 2021 surged 14% to $7.5 billion, its strongest performance since 2006 and better than a consensus estimate of around $7 billion from analysts compiled by the bank.
Profit for the fourth quarter tumbled a smaller-than-expected 18% to $1.3 billion, dragged down by a 650 million euro hike in provisions set aside to cover penalties in a case accusing the bank of helping wealthy clients in France evade taxes.
""We find 4Q21 results strong, continuing to show good revenue momentum across the board, while cost control was also impressive this quarter,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.
UBS revised its goal for earnings it wants to generate off underlying expenses, setting a 70%-73% target for its cost-income ratio, more ambitious than its previous target of 75%-78%.
It also said it aimed to boost the returns it generates off core or common equity tier 1 capital to 15%-18%, up from its previous guidance for 12%-15%.
TECH LEG-UP
Eager to expand outside its core client base of billionaires and multi-millionaires, UBS in October outlined a plan to lure clients in America with a digitally scalable advice model.
Last week, it also agreed to buy California-based digital wealth management startup Wealthfront in a $1.4 billion all-cash deal, targeting younger tech-savvy U.S. investors.
On Tuesday, it said it was open to further bolt-on acquisitions and would seek to extend its digital offerings to reach affluent clients in other key markets as well.
""Together, we can expand our wallet share, access new clients, lower the cost to serve, and drive long-term growth,"" it said in a statement. ""Looking ahead, we are planning similar models in the rest of the world.""
It said it aims to lift invested assets across wealth management, asset management and its Swiss home market business to $6 trillion, from $4.6 trillion currently but did not specify a timeframe.
The world's biggest wealth manager, UBS has sailed through the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to buoyant markets and a spike in trading by its ultra-wealthy clients.
Its results contrast sharply with scandal-hit  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which has warned of a fourth-quarter loss, flagging fresh legal costs.
On Tuesday, UBS said that during the fourth quarter it had continued to see high levels of client activity in its core wealth management division, with increases in revenue from lending, recurring fees and transactions pushing up operating income 13% year-on-year.

The division posted $26.9 billion in fresh fee-generating client inflows, which with gains in asset prices, pushed invested assets in its global wealth management business up 3% from the previous quarter to $3.3 trillion.
Its asset management division saw pre-tax profit fall 17% with the bank citing more ""normalized levels"" for performance fees, while profits from investment banking soared 35% on the back of higher revenues from trading and dealmaking.

Investing.com — Shares of Chinese electric vehicle firms Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI) and  Xpeng Inc  (NYSE:XPEV) all opened higher before sliding Tuesday after reporting their delivery numbers for January. 
NIO revealed it delivered 9,652 vehicles in January, increasing by 33.6% year-over-year, but the number dipped from the 10,489 delivered in December.
Meanwhile, competitor XPeng delivered over 10,000 vehicles for the fifth straight month, recording 12,922 deliveries in January, significantly lower than the 16,000 electric vehicles delivered in December.
In January, Li Auto delivered 12,268 Li ONEs, representing a 128.1% increase year over year, but down from 14,087 in December. 
XPeng shares hit a high of $36.81, while NIO rose to $24.89 and Li Auto touched $27.11 per share. However, after each stock made significant moves higher Monday, possibly in anticipation of positive delivery numbers, the momentum has fizzled, and the gains and more have been lost. 
NIO has taken the biggest tumble, down 3.75%, which is possibly down to the company slipping further behind its rivals when it comes to deliveries.
Overall, the lower month-on-month numbers may be explained by China cutting its EV subsidies by 30% at the beginning of January, while the companies have also had to contend with semiconductor chip shortages."

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said on Tuesday it will spin off WarnerMedia in a $43 billion transaction to merge its media properties with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc and also cut its dividend by nearly half.
AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the new Warner Bros. Discovery company and will receive a 0.24 shares of Warner Bros. Discovery for each AT&T share they own. AT&T will have 7.2 billion diluted shares outstanding after the transaction closes.
The U.S. telecoms group will pay a dividend of $1.11 per share, down from $2.08 per share. This is at the lower end of an $8 billion to $9 billion range AT&T had forecast earlier.
AT&T shares fell nearly 5% at the open.
The deal to unwind AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner was announced early last year, but some financial details were not disclosed until Tuesday.
""Rather than try to account for market volatility in the near-term and decide where to apportion value in the process of doing an exchange of shares, the spin-off distribution will let the market do what markets do best,"" AT&T CEO John Stankey said in a prepared statement.
""We are confident both equities will soon be valued on the solid fundamentals and attractive prospects they represent.""
AT&T anticipates spending about $20 billion in capex this year to invest more heavily into fiber to the home broadband internet services and expanding its 5G wireless footprint.
The transaction will help reduce AT&T's heavy debt load. It ended the fourth quarter with net debt of $156.2 billion, giving it a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 3.22 times.
AT&T said it expected the debt ratio to drop to 2.5 times by the end of 2023 and that it would consider share buybacks if the ratio is reduced further.
Warner Bros Discovery will be playing catchup to larger streaming video rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) even though WarnerMedia's HBO Max grew faster in the United States in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 74 million subscribers. 
But the combination, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will be coming together just as Netflix is showing signs of maturity.

Netflix's surprisingly weak guidance for the first quarter of the year spooked investors in the media sector, sparking a sector wide selloff.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 09:57AM ET</span>","DoorDash couriers struggle to secure COVID sick pay, get back to work during Omicron surge","By Danielle Kaye
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A COVID-assistance policy at DoorDash Inc is frustrating some couriers who told Reuters the food-delivery company sidelined them for as long as a month while infections caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus flared, costing them much needed income.
DoorDash rolled out its COVID-19 Financial Assistance Program in March 2020, offering a driver who tests positive for COVID, or whose housemate tests positive, a one-time payment equal to their average earnings over the previous two weeks.
""Upon submitting a claim for health-related COVID-19 financial assistance, your Dasher account will be suspended to protect the DoorDash community,"" DoorDash said in a March 12, 2020 email to its drivers announcing the program. 
But six DoorDash couriers told Reuters that during the recent Omicron surge, DoorDash delayed making the assistance payments and suspended drivers' DoorDash accounts for prolonged periods, exacerbating the financial strain on gig workers who deliver food for a living.
When Cincinnati-based Doordash driver Josh Murphy notified the company about his roommate's positive COVID-19 test result on Dec. 21, DoorDash immediately deactivated Murphy's account for over three weeks – well beyond his 10-day quarantine period.
Murphy said he missed work for 17 days that he would normally be out delivering. He did eventually receive a check for $622 – but he estimates the prolonged account deactivation amounted to a $1,000 net loss, even after the payment. 
""I regret asking for the assistance, even though I needed it to pay rent,"" Murphy said.
A spokesperson for San Francisco-based DoorDash said in most cases medically-cleared drivers, known as Dashers, are able to get back online within 24 hours.
    “When a Dasher submits a qualifying claim, our team works quickly to process their two weeks' of earning replacement and suspend their Dasher account to protect the DoorDash community,” she said.
DoorDash has dedicated specific team members to process requests for financial assistance and reactivations after Dashers are medically cleared. The company has added additional team members to that group since the start of the pandemic, she noted, adding that significant delays are not widespread.
DoorDash declined to specify the number of couriers who have requested financial assistance since the start of the pandemic. DoorDash counted nearly 3 million people who provided services, or ""Dashed,"" during the third quarter, earning over $2.8 billion for drivers. The company reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16.
'MY ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME'
Getting financial assistance or paid sick leave for a COVID-related absence is especially hard for gig workers who lack employee benefits.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) discontinued its COVID financial assistance policy for drivers in August of 2021.  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), Grubhub, and Instacart still provide COVID sick pay and, like DoorDash, temporarily suspend workers' accounts after they request financial assistance, according to company spokespeople.
""Nobody forces (gig economy companies) to support the workers, because we're not employees,"" said Gustavo Ajche, a DoorDash courier in New York City and member of labor organization Los Deliveristas Unidos.
App-based delivery companies treat couriers as independent contractors. DoorDash agreed in November to pay more than $5 million to settle an investigation by San Francisco into alleged labor law violations. The city alleged DoorDash was violating its healthcare benefit and paid sick leave laws by misclassifying workers as independent contractors, rather than employees.
Complaints among DoorDash couriers about account suspensions and delays increased in late 2021 with the rise of Omicron, according to social media posts. 
Chris Lewis, of Long Beach, California, requested COVID financial assistance on Jan. 4. Emails seen by Reuters show he did not receive a response from the company asking him to verify his positive COVID test until Jan 18.
Lewis, who has already recovered from COVID, finally found out he is eligible for financial assistance on Jan. 28. 

Allie, a DoorDash driver in the Minneapolis suburbs, submitted a request to the company for COVID financial assistance when she tested positive just before Christmas. Her DoorDash account has been suspended for over four weeks, and she has yet to receive any sick pay, which she estimates amounts to $2,000 in lost income. 
""I do not wish to proceed with the financial assistance,"" she wrote in an email to DoorDash's support team on Jan. 14, ""as I am losing more money by not dashing and this is my only source of income.""

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has launched investments worth $6.4 billion in future technologies, the Saudi minister of communication and information technology said on Tuesday, as the kingdom races to diversify its economy from oil in the face of fierce regional competition.
Wealthy Gulf countries have launched initiatives to boost non-oil growth and reduce dependence on crude oil as climate change campaigners and volatility in oil prices have put pressure on government finances. 
The kingdom has already announced it is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into an economic transformation, known as Vision 2030, led by its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The investments announced on Tuesday include a $2 billion joint venture between eWTP Arabia Capital, a fund backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and China's J&T Express Group, minister Abdullah Alswaha said. 
Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222) will inject, via its fund Prosperity7 Ventures, $1 billion to help entrepreneurs across the globe build transformative start-ups, while Saudi Telecom Co (STC) will invest $1 billion in the infrastructure of submarine cables and data centres, he said.
""Right now, the tech and digital market in the kingdom is around $40 billion which is the largest by far in the region. We're very proud of the growth that we have seen in the region, specifically in areas around e-commerce, gaming, digital content and cloud,"" Alswaha said in a interview with Reuters.
The minister, who was speaking on the margins of LEAP, an international technology platform taking place in Riyadh, said Armaco Prosperity7's initiative will focus on green technologies while logistics company J&T Express Group's joint venture will build a smart hub for the region that will improve efficiency by up to 100%.
Alswaha said NEOM, a futuristic megacity that the crown prince is building on the Red Sea coast, has launched $1 billion of investments in a metaverse to serve the city's residents and visitors, in addition to another platform that would help users to take control of their personal data.

1229,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 09:50AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Mixed as Virus, Rate Concerns Linger; Dow Flat","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, unable to build immediately on Monday's momentum, which had allowed investors to claw back some of their losses on a bad opening month for 2022.
Evidence of sustained disruption to the economy and ongoing price pressures were enough to keep risk appetite within limits, especially for technology stocks, over which the series of interest rate increases this year still casts a long shadow.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 35,131 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite, which rose over 3% on Monday, fell 0.4%. 
There had been first signs that the Federal Reserve is starting to push back against expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes on Monday, with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly saying that tightening should be ""gradual and not disruptive."" However, Daly is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, while more outspoken hawks such as St. Louis' James Bullard and Kansas City's Esther George are voting members. George on Monday stressed the contribution that the reversal of previous bond purchases could make to policy this year, but both indicated they had no problems with a first rate hike in March.
Talking to Bloomberg TV earlier, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker refused to rule out that the first hike could be 50 basis points, rather than the 25bps that most expect. However, he said that would depend on the data between now and the March meeting. Tuesday's data did little to banish fears of a bigger hike, as job openings rose by more than expected to just short of their September record, while the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing survey showed another leap in its prices subindex.
The market's changing preference for cash today rather than cash tomorrow was reinforced earlier by  Exxon Mobil  's strongest quarterly results in seven years. The oil major swung back to a profit of just under $9 billion from a loss of some $20 billion a year earlier, thanks to rebounding prices for oil and gas that allowed its refineries and fields to run at higher utilization rates. It also started the $10 billion buyback program it flagged three months ago. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 3.4% to its highest since early 2019.
For technology, by contrast, it was a case of selling the bounce. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 1.9% after announcing a modest recall of just over 50,000 vehicles due to safety concerns about its ""Full Self Driving"" software. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.2% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 1.6%.
Elsewhere,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) stock soared over 12% after reporting a strong fourth quarter that led it to raise its dividend and predict a solid rise in earnings this year. The read-across for the rest of the sector was seen as so positive that the news dragged up FedEx stock by 2.8%, even though FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced it had been forced to suspend some domestic freight services due to Covid-related absenteeism.  That comes only a day after studies suggested a new and more infectious subvariant of the Omicron Covid-19 virus had taken root in over half of U.S. states."

(Reuters) -A report released by Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) on Tuesday outlined a culture of bullying, harassment and racism at the global mining giant, including 21 complaints of actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over the past five years.
Nearly half of all employees who responded to an external review of the miner's workplace culture commissioned by Rio said they had been bullied, while racism was found to be common across a number of areas.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said the results were ""disturbing"" and the company would implement all 26 recommendations from the report by former Australian sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick.
""The eye opener for me was two-fold,"" Stausholm told Reuters. ""I hadn't realised how much bullying exists in the company and secondly that it's quite systemic - the three issues of bullying, sexual harassment and racism ... that's extremely disturbing.""
Rio Tinto launched the review in March last year, not long after Stausholm took over the top job https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rio-tinto-ceo-idUSKBN28R0HJ in the wake of a widespread backlash against the company after it blasted the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine.
More than 10,000 employees, nearly a quarter of its 45,000-strong workplace shared their experiences and views for the study.
The report found nearly 30% women and about 7% of men have experienced sexual harassment at work, with 21 women reporting actual or attempted rape or sexual assault.
Racism was a ""significant challenge"" for employees at many locations. People working in a country different to their birth experienced high rates of racism while nearly 40% of men who identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Australia had experienced racism.
""I have copped racism in every single corner of this company,"" one employee was anonymously quoted as saying.
Rio said reforms will focus on a commitment from the company's leadership to create a safe and inclusive working environment, including by increasing diversity within the company. It would also ensure the company's remote mine site facilities are safe, and make it easier for staff to call out unacceptable behaviours.
""Clearly much more needs to be done to ensure the safety of workers in the resources sector,"" said Owen Whittle, Secretary for UnionsWA, which represents over 30 workers groups which have over 150,000 members in Western Australia.
""With nearly half of the workforce reporting bullying, it is clear that they have failed workers over a long period of time and need to do far more to prevent harassment and bullying in workplaces,"" he said.
SEXISM, RACISM
The Rio report comes ahead of the release of another report by the West Australia state government later this year on sexual harassment at mining camps https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-probe-put-spotlight-sexual-harassment-mining-camps-2021-08-13 in the state, which provides more than half of the world's supply of iron ore.
Submissions to the inquiry https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bhp-has-fired-48-workers-sexual-harassment-since-2019-2021-08-20/#:~:text=The%20survey%20of%20425%20workers,in%20the%20last%2012%20months last year said sexual harassment was rife at mining camps in Western Australia, which is home to mines of global firms including BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto and Fortescue.
A Western Australia state minister, Rita Saffioti, told Australia's ABC News that she was very disturbed by the number of allegations.
""You want everyone to be able to feel safe in their workplace. Also in particular in those areas where you're a bit more isolated from friends and family and you want to have the utmost protection from having that type of behaviour,"" she said.
In a 2020 report, an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into sexual harassment found that 74% of women in the mining industry had experienced some form of sexual harassment in the past five years, partly due to a gender imbalance.
Nearly 80% of Rio Tinto's workforce is male.
""Creating a safe, respectful work culture will encourage people of all backgrounds and diversity to thrive in our organisations,"" Kellie Parker, the Australian CEO for Rio Tinto told Reuters.
Male and female employees in South Africa experienced the highest rates of racism. Employees spoke of the frequency of racism and its impacts on their confidence, self-esteem and work performance.
""Rio is a Caucasian oriented company,"" one employee said in the report. 
Rio said the report came at a pivotal time as workplace cultures shift against the backdrop of #MeToo, Black Lives Matter and other global movements, as well as an Australian inquiry into Rio's destruction of Juukan Gorge https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rio-tinto-should-pay-restitution-sacred-aboriginal-caves-blast-inquiry-2020-12-11, culturally significant rock shelters.

Stausholm said Juukan Gorge had triggered the biggest management change in the history of Rio and the new team wanted to drive more change.
""Its a matter of using the momentum of the moment now and try to move these actions forward fast because we cannot change these from one day to another.""

(Reuters) - The New York Times Co's acquisition of Wordle has created uproar on social media, with fans expressing fears that the popular online word game, which is currently free to play, might be put behind a paywall. 
Announcing on Monday that it had bought Wordle for an undisclosed price in the low seven figures, the Times said the game would ""initially"" remain free for existing and new players.
That wording led some social media users to suggest the media company would soon allow only subscribers access. 
""I have never seen Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as immediately mad as it is about the NYT Wordle buyout,"" one user tweeted. ""The NYT took one nice and simple thing that a lot of people really liked, a dumb bit of fun in our exhaustingly dark times, and implied that they'll stick it behind a paywall."" 
After creating Wordle to play with his girlfriend Palak Shah, software engineer Josh Wardle released it to the public in October. Within months it became a global phenomenon, with celebrities such as Trevor Noah joining the bandwagon.
The once-a-day online game gives a player six chances to figure out a five-letter word, using the least number of guesses.
""I would be lying if I said this hasn't been a little overwhelming,"" Wardle said on a post on Twitter. ""After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone.""
The Times said it expects the acquisition to broaden its digital content as it tries to reach the goal of 10 million subscribers by 2025. 
The newspaper was an early adopter of the paywall when it started digital subscription plans back in 2011. That strategy helped it buck the trend of falling print revenues and build a digital business.
It has also bought into other digital media such as subscription-based audio app Audm and product review website Wirecutter. Last month it agreed to pay $550 million in cash for sports site The Athletic. 

As the Times also seeks to grow paid readers outside its core news content, games and puzzles have become a key part of a strategy to keep its audience engaged on its apps and websites.
Its Games unit, which has more than one million subscriptions, started with the Daily Crossword, and later launched games such as Spelling Bee, Tiles, Letter Boxed and Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX).

For the full year, the company expects consolidated revenue of about $102 billion compared to $97 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating margin is seen improving a tad to 13.7%.
The company’s decision to boost its quarterly dividend by 49% is also adding to the gains in the stock price. UPS will also buy back shares worth at least $1 billion this year, the company said."

Investing.com –  Exxon Mobil  stock (NYSE:XOM) rose 1.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after the company beat earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, thanks to higher margins and capacity utilization.
With crude and gas prices surging as demand recovered in the second half of last year, Exxon swung back to a net profit of nearly $9 billion compared to a loss of $20 billion in the same period a year ago.
Against that backdrop, Exxon said it has initiated the $10 billion share repurchase program it flagged in October, and will conclude the exercise over 12-24 months.
Shortages in Europe and Asia have pushed crude and gas prices to multi-year highs. Last week, crude crossed $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Integrated energy companies such as Exxon and Shell (LON:RDSa) with both upstream and downstream operations, tend to benefit the most in such a booming market.
In the upstream business that involves exploration of crude and gas, average realizations for crude oil increased 8% from the third quarter. Natural gas realizations increased 63% from the prior quarter.
Margins improved in the refining business that involves making of fuels for end-use. Refining throughput, a measure of utilization, in the quarter was the highest since 2013.
Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 83% to nearly $85 billion but fell short of estimates.  
Any disappointment there was softened by the company saying it will exceed its 2023 target of cutting $6 billion in operating costs, having already reached close to $5 billion. The target was set in 2019.

1236,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",Worst-Ever Outflows for SPY ETF as QQQ Bleeds Most Since Dot-Com,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest exchange-traded fund posted its worst monthly outflow in its near three-decade history with investors selling the Monday stock rebound en masse.
The $407 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY), known by its ticker SPY, in January saw its biggest redemption since launching in 1993, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, underscoring weeks of turmoil in U.S. large-cap companies. 
Some $6.96 billion exited Monday alone -- the largest daily outflow in almost four years -- as the S&P 500 jumped 1.9%.
The January exits were not contained to the S&P 500 fund. The $191 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), which follows the Nasdaq 100 Index of tech names, posted its largest investor exodus since the dot-com collapse as about $6.2 billion fled.
The Monday SPY flow is a sign that a cohort of traders may be taking advantage of the recent stock bounce to pare broad-market positions via liquid trading vehicles. Futures for the main U.S. equity gauges were fluctuating on Tuesday morning in New York.
“Investors are worried the rally could be a head fake,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “These feel like sell-into-strength flows.”
U.S. stocks have endured a volatile start to the year, as investors adjust expectations for inflation and the pace of monetary tightening in the world’s largest economy. Rising bond yields have spurred traders to re-evaluate shares at near-record prices. 
Despite a late bounce, the S&P 500 closed the month down 5.3%. In turn, trading volumes have surged to a record by value in the ETF market. The biggest vehicles like SPY have become ever-more prized for their liquidity, which means short-term inflows and outflows can be elevated.
Even as investors soured on large-cap funds, equity ETFs overall in the U.S. recorded net inflows in January of about $23 billion, the data show. Much of that cash went toward funds with international exposure, as well as more targeted trades.
The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLF) and Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) were among the flow leaders with $3.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
“People are being more targeted,” said Psarofagis. “For instance, energy has been one of the best sectors since the top and you won’t get much of that in broad-based indexes.”

Net income adjusted for one-time items was $2.05 a share, according to a statement on Tuesday, 12 cents above the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year capital spending will jump to $21 billion to $24 billion from $16.6 billion in 2021. The shares rose as much as 1.9% in pre-market trading.
The results come a day after Exxon disclosed yet another belt-tightening move, this time involving shuttering its corporate headquarters in suburban Dallas and consolidating those offices near Houston. Exxon shares have risen more than 20% this year, capping an almost 50% advance in 2021 for the best annual performance in at least four decades.
Natural gas sales provided the primary uplift in fourth-quarter results as Exxon and other suppliers reaped hefty returns amid fuel shortages across Europe and parts of Asia. Escalating oil prices also proved a boon to the Western world’s largest crude explorer. 
Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’ decision to reverse course on a pre-pandemic growth plan and hold capital spending at historically low levels means high commodity prices are translating directly into massive cash flow.
While some observers have raised concerns about Exxon’s long-term commitment to fossil fuels, in the near term the company is profitably harvesting older reserves and replacing them with high-margin barrels from new discoveries in places such as Guyana. 
In 2021, Exxon garnered ample cash to repair its balance sheet, pay the S&P 500 Index’s third-largest dividend and pledge to restart share buybacks. It’s a remarkable financial turnaround for the oil giant a year after it incurred its first annual loss in at least 40 years during the darkest days of the pandemic. 
Exxon is under pressure to do more on climate change, especially after activist investor Engine No. 1’s success last year. Its recently announced ambition to eliminate emissions from its operations by 2050 is one step in that direction but the company will also have to allocate more cash to its low-carbon business over time, especially in areas like carbon capture and biofuels.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",Analysis-Tech-light corporate bonds swerve worst of stock market woes,"By Yoruk Bahceli and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is on the policy-tightening warpath and global stocks have endured their worst start to the year since 2016, yet corporate credit, with limited exposure to the worst-hit tech companies, is proving remarkably resilient.
While U.S. and European companies' bonds -- those rated investment-grade (IG) as well as riskier ones with junk credit ratings -- endured the biggest losses in January since March 2020, their falls were dwarfed by equities, where a global index shed $7 trillion in market value.
Within the sector, U.S. IG fared the worst with a 3% loss but that was much less than the S&P 500's 5% drop. 
Even though U.S. investment-grade credit risk premia rose to a one-year high, they are at levels similar to early February 2020. 
Credit was arguably less pumped up by central bank stimulus; U.S. IG debtholders earned 9% returns through 2020-2021, while U.S. equities returned 47%.
Many companies also used the zero-rates period to refinance debt and raise cash; by last September, U.S. and European firms' debt levels relative to profits had declined to pre-pandemic levels.
And as economies recover and corporate profits grow, default risks recede. By the end of 2021, default rates at junk-grade companies -- those with credit ratings below BBB-minus -- were at 1.7%, according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
That's down from 6.9% in 2020, and even below pre-pandemic levels around 3.3%. 
GRAPHIC - U.S. corporate bond spreads
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnejkdzpl/US%20corp%20spreads%20feb%201.png 
But a major reason for the resilience is perhaps what  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) calls a ""lack of crossover"" between equity and corporate debt indexes. In other words, their constituents are vastly different.
The recent equity sell-off was most damaging for tech shares which are classed as long-duration assets that are vulnerable to higher interest rates. 
Deutsche noted that the top 10 U.S. companies -- mostly tech firms -- comprised 28.5% of the S&P 500 but less than 4% of the IG bond index. 
The majority of top IG constituents are non-tech and therefore less vulnerable to moves in underlying rates. 
""If tech leads any U.S. sell-off, credit will be relatively insulated,"" Deutsche told clients, adding that correlations of credit spreads to equity moves had declined sharply over the past 12 months. 
Within credit, the high-yield index, with near zero tech exposure, has outperformed its IG peer noted Flavio Carpenzano, investment director at Capital Group.
Its duration, representing its sensitivity to moves in underlying interest rates, is around 5 years in the U.S. as high yield debt tends to be shorter-dated, versus around 8-1/2 years on the IG index, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
""It's an environment where the asset classes most sensitive to interest rates are the ones underperforming so that means tech stocks or (investment-grade) credit, while others such as (high-yield) credit are doing better,"" he said. 
In Europe too, 20 companies comprise nearly a third of the STOXX 600 but 7% of the IG index, according to Deutsche Bank. 
LOW YIELDS
The January volatility did not prevent companies from tapping markets; U.S. IG bond sales hit a five-year high, Refinitiv data shows. 
Last month's jump in inflation-adjusted yields -- effectively the real cost of capital -- coinciding with the stock market sell-off, has started to tighten financial conditions, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)'s financial conditions indexes show. 
Yet financial conditions, which determine how easy it is to access finance, remain near the loosest on record and markets still expect U.S. interest rates to peak just below 2% in this cycle -- the so-called terminal rate. 
GRAPHIC - Financial conditions are tightening
https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/GLOBAL-MARKETS/zgvomaqzovd/chart.png 
In fact, borrowing costs for companies in BofA's U.S. IG index have room to rise another 80 bps before they exceed the index's par-weighted coupon, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
In other words, companies can still reduce their interest costs by refinancing their debt. 
""As long as terminal rate pricing or the Fed's dot plot doesn't shift meaningfully higher than 2%, markets will keep a lid on credit and FX volatility,"" said John Marley, CEO of forexxtra, a London-based consultancy.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 07:50AM ET</span>","Virgin Money sees rebound in credit card, travel spending","By Sinchita Mitra and Yadarisa Shabong
(Reuters) -British bank Virgin Money (LON:VM) said on Tuesday credit card spending was back to pre-pandemic levels thanks to pent up demand, while rising interest rates helped to lift its margin forecast for the year.
Spending on credit cards had taken a hit since the onset of the pandemic as people poured money into savings and investments, while cancelling travel plans and spending less in lockdowns.
But easing restrictions have boosted consumer and business confidence. 
Finance chief Clifford Abrahams told Reuters the bank was seeing travel spending on its credit cards return to levels achieved before COVID-19.
""Customers who are feeling good about their jobs, about the prospective wage increases, some of them have money on deposit, so they are willing to spend,"" Abrahams said.
Virgin Money forecast that its net interest margin (NIM) - a key measure of a bank's underlying profitability - will be about 175 basis points in the year to September 2022. 
The outlook comes as the Bank of England raised interest rates in December, with more increases expected to follow to combat rising inflation.
Analysts said Virgin Money's first-quarter trading update for the three months to December set a broadly positive tone for the industry ahead of rivals' full-year earnings later this month.
""We view the recovery in unsecured balances as a helpful read-across for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) within the UK banks,"" analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove said in a note.
Virgin Money's shares rose 3% in early trading before losing momentum, and were broadly flat at 1200 GMT. 
The British bank, which has already launched instalment lending on its credit cards, plans to offer a subscription-based digital credit product in the next few quarters mainly for younger people looking to build their credit scores.
""Younger people want to build their credit history while looking to stay in control,"" Abrahams said.

The bank, which in November said it was looking to digitalise its services at a faster pace, also said new accounts opened exceeded 132,000 in the quarter - the highest since the start of the pandemic.
Virgin Money, formerly known as CYBG, saw a decline in mortgages lending and business lending owing to a fall in government-backed lending in the sector and weaker market demand.

Wall Street firms were among the first to encourage staff to return to offices, but a winter wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant led many to rethink their plans, instructing staff to work from home over the holidays and through January.
Many bank staff are now heading back to the office for the first time in several weeks.
Staff at Jefferies, the first major Wall Street bank to instruct employees to work from home in December, returned to the office Monday. 
Chief Executive Rich Handler offered a special reward - dinner Monday evening for the first seven staff to respond via his Instagram account - provided they had a booster vaccine, were born in 1992 or later, and had been in the office that day. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is encouraging employees to return this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the country's largest bank, expects staff to return to the office on a rotational basis this month, a spokesman said.
""It's just great to be back in,"" said one U.S. bank employee, who asked not to be named.
Next Monday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) will revert to requiring New York City area employees to come into the office at least twice a week. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) began bringing staff back to offices last week in parts of the United States where new COVID-19 cases have started to decline.
Citi was the first and, so far only, bank to require staff to be vaccinated or be terminated unless they have an exemption.
Nearly all staff have now complied with that requirement, a person familiar with the matter said.

European banks are also bringing staff back into their U.S. offices.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) employees will start returning to the office next Monday.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) staff returned Monday and will have to present a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of returning to the office, a person familiar with the matter said. Going forward, they will need to test for the virus once a week, and the bank has expanded on-site testing towards that effort, the source said.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 07:40AM ET</span>",Some cars' systems designed to keep drivers' eyes on the road fail - AAA study,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Some vehicles equipped with automated assistance technology aimed at keeping drivers alert and watching the road fail at that job, an American Automobile Association study found on Tuesday.
The AAA study said monitoring systems that rely only on how drivers' handle the steering wheel were not successful. Those that use cameras to monitor drivers' eye and head position were significantly more effective at keeping drivers focused while vehicle software is engaged.
On average, those direct monitoring systems issued an alert to the driver around 50 seconds sooner than those relying on indirect steering wheel input, AAA said. 
(Graphic: Some driver monitoring systems fail at their job: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-AUTONOMOUS/SAFTEY/gkplgboywvb/chart.png) 
Monitoring systems are becoming widespread as part of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which can automate some driving tasks and control a car's braking and acceleration. Automakers are offering them on more vehicle models and the cost of the technology boosts car sales prices. 
Automakers tout the systems as improving safety and convenience, but insurance groups and safety researchers have repeatedly warned that drivers can mistake them for self-driving systems, leading to overreliance.
The AAA study tested two camera-based monitoring systems, a 2021 Cadillac Escalade with General Motors (NYSE:GM)' ""Super Cruise"" system and a 2021 Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Forester with ""EyeSight"" technology, and two systems that only rely on steering wheel engagement: a 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe with ""Highway Driving Assist"" and a 2020 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 with ""Autopilot.""
The Hyundai system performed worst, followed by the Tesla. Subaru's and GM's systems were much better at keeping drivers engaged, but none of the monitoring systems performed perfectly.
""Driver monitoring systems are a good first step to preventing deadly crashes, but they are not foolproof,"" said Greg Brannon, director of AAA's automotive engineering.

Tesla Model 3s and Ys produced in 2021 and later offer cabin cameras to determine driver inattentiveness, the carmaker says. 
AAA said it got a 2020 Model 3 strictly based on availability.

Investing.com – AT&T stock (NYSE:T) traded 4% lower in premarket Tuesday after the telecoms giant nearly halved its dividend payout to $1.11 per share from $2.08.
According to the company, the dividend cut reflects the distribution of WarnerMedia to AT&T shareholders.
AT&T’s board today signed off on separating WarnerMedia from itself and merging it and the rest of the media business with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA).
The deal will generate AT&T $43 billion in cash and other considerations, while its shareholders will receive around 71% of the new company, Warner Bros Discovery, in stock. They will get 0.24 shares of WBD for each AT&T share they own.
Discovery shareholders will own about 29% in WBD.
AT&T plans to use part of the proceeds to reduce its debt which stood in excess of $156 billion at the end of December. AT&T expects net debt will fall to 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x by end-2023, from a ratio of 3.2x now.
WBD will be competing with the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ at a time when subscriber base is slowing, and content costs surging. WarnerMedia's HBO Max grew faster in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 74 million subscribers."

""Cross-border mergers in banks have only worked to a certain extent,"" Hamers said after the bank's fourth-quarter results, adding that the capital and liquidity benefits involved had been eroded due to rules keeping money within a country. 
""I would expect cross-border mergers to happen (only) if a player already had a sizeable position in a country where the target would be, in order to firm up the local market share, the local scale,"" he told reporters.
""You can expect much more local mergers and acquisitions ... because then you are for sure in the same regulatory environment, the same legal environment, the same tax environment for your products, the same technology environment.""
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, said earlier on Tuesday that it was open to further bolt-on acquisitions after the announcement in January of its $1.4 billion purchase of digital wealth management startup Wealthfront.
Hamers declined to define the size of such deals, saying only that UBS would consider targets smaller than itself.

""I can't give you an indication (of size). It really depends on the opportunity that presents itself,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, continuing January’s weak tone as investors cautiously await the release of more important corporate earnings.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 40 points, or 0.3%.
The major Wall Street indices suffered hefty losses in January as investors adjusted to a hawkish policy shift from the Federal Reserve, implying as many as six interest rates this year to combat inflation that is currently running at 40-year highs. 
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 3.3% in January, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 5.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped 9%, their worst months since March 2020.
Fed policymakers were out in force on Monday, indicating that interest rates would rise in March, but they also tried to rein in expectations of a 50 basis point hike this quarter.
Still, there remains a degree of caution ahead of a flurry of corporate earnings which could set the tone for February.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) delivered numbers before the bell, while the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AMD and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) will report after the bell.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after the electric car manufacturer said it will recall over 50,000 U.S. vehicles with its Full Self-Driving software over safety worries.
Additionally, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has suspended its domestic express freight services due to staff shortages as cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus rise, while AT&T (NYSE:T) said it will cut its dividend after spinning off WarnerMedia in a $43 billion transaction to merge its media properties with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA).
The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index heads the data calendar Tuesday, but the December JOLTS jobs openings will also be studied ahead of Friday’s January nonfarm payrolls report. Economists are forecasting that the economy added 155,000 jobs, slowing from 199,000 in December as the Omicron variant hit.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, just below last week’s seven-year highs, following reports quoting sources close to OPEC as seeing the global market in surplus by over 1 million barrels a day this year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is meeting on Wednesday to discuss future production levels. 
The American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly inventory data later in the session.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $87.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $88.90. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 on Friday.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 0.7% lower in premarket Tuesday as the company recalls 53,822 cars and SUVs because their “Full Self-Driving” software lets them roll through stop signs without coming to a complete halt.
The recall covers Model S sedans and X SUVs from 2016 through 2022, Model 3 sedans built between 2017 and 2022 and Model Y sports utility vehicles made 2020 through 2022.
The company will disable the feature with an over-the-internet software update this month, according to documents posted by regulator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Selected Tesla drivers are ‘beta testing’ the FSD software. The company says the vehicles cannot drive themselves and drivers must be ready to take control at any point of time. FSD vehicles remain a priority for the company, CEO Elon Musk said last week while announcing its fourth quarter results. The company has repeatedly failed to meet Musk's publicly stated predictions.
According to the documents, Tesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the safety regulators. Tesla knows of no crashes or injuries caused by the feature.
This is the second major recall by the EV-maker in about a month. Late December, it ordered recall of more than 475,000 of its Model 3 and Model S electric cars to address rearview camera and trunk issues that increased the risk of crashing, according to Reuters.  "
1250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 06:46AM ET</span>",Funds recommend slight reduction to equity allocations: Reuters poll,"By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund managers slightly reduced their recommended exposure to risky assets in favour of bond holdings as they brace for more volatility in financial markets caused by sticky inflation and aggressive central banks, a Reuters poll found.
Recommended equity allocations were trimmed to an average of 50.1% of a model global portfolio from 50.3% in the previous month, according to a survey of 35 international funds in January. 
Recommended bond holdings were raised by a similar amount to 39.3% of a balanced global portfolio, with allocations to cash, property and alternatives steady at 3.6%, 1.3% and 5.7%, respectively.
Fears of central banks turning more hawkish and rising geopolitical tensions dragged MSCI's equities world index to the brink of its worst January since 2008 but better U.S. corporate earnings helped recoup some losses.
Those earnings reports meant the Nasdaq ended January strongly after narrowly avoiding its worst ever start to the year, but the S&P 500 still recorded its weakest January since the global financial crisis.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is gearing up to raise interest rates in March. Other central banks have already started tightening or are set to follow the Fed after years of pandemic-related emergency stimulus.
""This is not a time to add risk, but to stick to the core convictions. Equity volatility is on the rise and will stay higher as markets reassess the inflation path and central banks' response .... Single-digit equity returns in 2022 is our base case,"" said Matteo Germano, head of multi-asset at Amundi.
The correction in asset prices last month came as inflation soared nearly everywhere.
""Higher inflation and higher rates will take a bite out of equity earnings. After decades on the back burner, the great inflation comeback will mean investors need to shift their mindset to real from nominal returns,"" Germano added.
""Playing ongoing market gyrations will be paramount for generating returns.""

Fund managers now see the top risks to their portfolio positions as sticky inflation and how aggressively the Fed hikes interest rates.
That is a move away from coronavirus and its variants, a risk they flagged consistently through most of the pandemic.

Investing.com –  Sony  stock (NYSE:SONY) traded up 1.2% in premarket Tuesday as it struck a deal to buy Bungie, a U.S. video game developer behind the popular Destiny and Halo franchises, for $3.6 billion.
Bungie will operate as an independent subsidiary of Sony once the transaction concludes.
Sony usually goes for small-ticket acquisitions in the videogame studios business but was forced to go for a big one after rivals clinched two large deals in January alone.
On January 10,  Take-Two Interactive  (NASDAQ:TTWO) agreed to acquire mobile game leader Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) at an enterprise value of close to $13 billion. Then on January 18, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the biggest deal in the gaming industry, acquiring ‘Candy Crush’-owner Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for nearly $69 billion.
The Bungie purchase gives Sony one of the most popular first-person shooter games to compete with the massive Call of Duty series, which is now in Microsoft’s hands after the Activision acquisition.
The long-term growth of videogaming has intensified with the pandemic, as stuck-at home consumers found new ways to entertain themselves. It is now also seen as an important element of in the still-nascent ‘metaverse’ – a virtual world that allows people to interact with friends, play video games, watch a movie, study or attend a concert online. Microsoft’s, and now Sony’s acquisitions, are directed at a play in metaverse.
Bungie was founded in 1991 and helped put Microsoft’s gaming console Xbox on the map. Microsoft paid about $30 million to acquire the studio when it was mostly a Mac game developer, and then spun it off in 2007. Bungie worked on ‘Destiny’ with Activision. That relationship ended in 2019."

(Reuters) - Debt-ladden Cineworld is in talks to delay payments to former ""dissenting"" shareholders of its U.S. division Regal, the British chain said on Tuesday, to bolster its available cash as cinemas reopen amid a long-drawn legal dispute with Cineplex.
The London-listed company said it had obtained undertakings to waive off any default arising from non-payment of dues to creditors, including certain holders of the company's guaranteed convertible bond due 2025.
Cineworld said in September it would pay $170 million to those shareholders, disgruntled with the 2017 price when it took over the U.S. chain and created the world's second-largest movie theatre operator.
Shares in Cineworld fell as much as 3%, before paring losses to trade 1% lower by 1006 GMT.
""Cineworld should be a beneficiary of cinema's revival... but whether the market will recognise this given the mess the company finds itself in is open to question,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
The company said it was ""hopeful"" a satisfactory agreement with Regal former shareholders could be reached within the period afforded by the waivers. 
SINGING IN THE RED
Although the success of the Marvel superhero film ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" boosted Cineworld's sales following a recent pickup, it has been struggling with debt of about $8.4 billion.
A large chunk of the group's debt comes from the Regal deal, and Cineworld even contemplated a U.S.-listing to bolster finances.
Cineworld's combined credit score - measuring how likely a company is to default in the next year on a scale of 100 (very unlikely) to 1 (highly likely) - was 1, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

The firm was also hit by possible damages of C$1.23 billion ($969.80 million) in December over a botched deal with Canada's Cineplex, a fine which some analysts said was bigger than Cineworld's available resources.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming service will launch in 15 European countries, including Poland, Portugal and Romania, on March 8, making it available in 61 territories across Europe and the Americas.
The service, owned by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), entered Europe in October by launching in the Nordics and Spain, with a host of promotional offers to grab customers from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.
In Eastern Europe and Portugal, apart from an attractive monthly price, customers signing up during the launch offer will get 33% off from the regular price for life, Johannes Larcher, head of HBO Max International, said in an interview. 
The monthly subscription for HBO Portugal was 4.99 euros ($5.59) per month and HBO Max will be priced at 5.99 euros, but existing subscribers and the ones who sign up in March will have to pay 3.99 euros a month.
Unlike the promotional launch offers in the Nordics and Spain, existing customers in the new markets will get the reduced price for life.
The company did not disclose prices for the Netherlands.
""We only started launching HBO Max in new markets in the middle of last year and added almost 8 million subscribers outside the U.S. in 2021,"" Larcher said. 
HBO ended the year with 73.8 million subscribers for its streaming service and namesake cable network. 
It plans to launch the service in another six European countries, including Greece and Turkey, later this year.
However, HBO Max will not be available in the UK, Germany and Italy for the next few years due to an existing deal with Sky.
While the company has plans to launch HBO Max in 190 countries by 2026, it has not announced any plans for Asia yet.

""We are working hard on preparing for a potential launch in Asia ... it's fair to expect that Southeast Asia would probably be the first market in Asia we would go in with HBO Max,"" Larcher said.

Investing.com –  NXP Semiconductors  stock (NASDAQ:NXPI) traded 0.8% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company gave robust guidance for the ongoing quarter, projecting its revenue will grow at least 18% year-on-year to $3.03 billion.
The outlook reflects sustained demand from a range of sectors, further evidence that the boom for semiconductors ushered in by the pandemic is taking longer to fade than many expected.
The company said it has designed processors for automotive, smart home, building and factory applications which automate system behavior based on user needs. Less than two months ago, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) picked NXP networking processors to go into its global fleet.  
Adjusted gross margin is seen at 57.3% at the midpoint of its guidance range, wider than 54.2% a year ago, and unchanged from the recent quarter. 
“We continue to see growing customer demand, outstripping supply, as inventory across all end markets remains very lean. Taken together, this underpins our continued confidence of robust growth throughout 2022,” a company statement quoted NXP President and Chief Executive Officer Kurt Sievers as saying.
NXP also said it will repurchase shares worth as much as $2 billion and increased its quarterly dividend by 50% to about 85 cents a share. The new share repurchase authorization is in addition to nearly $1.35 billion remaining under the previous exercise.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose more than 21% to top $3 billion. Adjusted profit per share was $4.45, well ahead of estimates.

Consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in almost 30 years, stoked by global supply chain problems and increases in the price of raw materials, forcing companies to increasingly pass higher costs on to customers.
Irn-Bru is regarded by many as a national symbol of Scotland and is known for its surreal and sometimes provocative advertising campaigns. Described as Scotland's other national drink, with whisky being the first, it secured another fan last year when U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tried it at the COP26 climate summit in Scotland.

The company, which also makes the Rubicon and Sun Exotic brands of fruit drinks, said it would seek opportunities to offset the impact of inflation on its business.
Its shares rose 2.7% on Tuesday as it raised its revenue outlook, outperforming the wider FTSE 350 index.
Cost pressures for British consumers look likely to intensify over the next few months, although some business surveys show tentative signs that input cost pressures for companies may have peaked.

British grocery inflation rose to 3.8% in the four weeks to Jan. 23, with the prices of savoury snacks, crisps and beef rising the most, market researcher Kantar said on Tuesday, underlining the growing cost-of-living squeeze facing many households.
The headline gauge of annual consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in December and the Bank of England thinks it will peak at around 6% in April.

1259,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 04:22AM ET</span>",European Stocks Surge Higher; Strong UBS Earnings Help,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded firmly higher Tuesday, starting the new month on a positive note, helped by a change in tone from Federal Reserve officials, even in the face of weak German retail sales.
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.1%, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 1.1%.
February has started brightly, rebounding from January’s sharp losses. The Stoxx 600 index dropped almost 4% in January, its worst month since October 2020. Reassuring comments about the pace of U.S. monetary tightening from two regional Fed presidents on Monday have calmed fears about a potential 'policy mistake'.
Helping the tone Tuesday were strong quarterly numbers from UBS (SIX:UBSG), continuing the largely encouraging earnings season for the European banking sector, with the Swiss banking giant increasing its share buyback program after reporting its best annual profit since the global financial crisis. Its stock soared over 6% to a four-year high.
Virgin Money (LON:VMUK) stock rose 0.4% after the British challenger bank increased its annual net interest margin outlook, as it benefits from rising interest rates and credit card spending recovery to pre-pandemic levels.
Additionally, Novozymes (CSE:NZYMb) stock rose 1.7% after the Danish enzymes maker said it expected sales to grow organically by between 3%-7% in the next financial year.
Still, despite these gains, the economic recovery within the Eurozone remains a cause for concern. German retail sales slumped 5.5% on the month in December as tighter coronavirus-related restrictions hurt trade, while French inflation slowed less than expected, rising 3.3% from a year earlier in January following December’s 3.4% increase, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to reassess its monetary policies.
Aside from these concerns, the fraught situation on the Russia-Ukraine border shows no signs of improving with the United States and the U.K. warning Russia on Monday that any invasion would trigger sanctions against companies and people close to the Kremlin.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, remaining close to the seven-year highs seen last week on expectations that the demand/supply balance will remain tight given a strong post-pandemic global recovery and limited output increases from the world’s top exporters.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is expected to stick with its plan to cautiously increase production when they meet on Wednesday.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $88.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $89.29. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since October 2014 on Friday, with the Nymex contract gaining over 17%, its biggest January gain in at least 30 years. The Brent contract also rose 15% in the month.  
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,802.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1254.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 03:55AM ET</span>","Marketmind: Betting on a ""very unlikely"" ECB rate move","A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe stood firm on Tuesday against markets pricing several interest rate rises this year, showing he was adamant that rates would not rise until inflation is ""sustainably"" within the target range.
That hasn't shaken markets' conviction any, with a RBA rate rise priced for as early as May. 
A similar drama may play out in Europe, where markets are wagering the European Central Bank will raise interest rates by 10 basis points, almost three times this year. Bets are starting to be placed in fact on a July move as well.
To quote ECB boss Christine Lagarde, a 2022 rate rise does seem ""very unlikely"". That's what she said last month but since then, she will have watched robust Q4 economic readings trickle in, including German annual inflation on Monday at 4.9%. 
Chances are euro area price growth will overrun the ECB's 3.2% average forecast for this year. 
GRAPHIC: When will euro zone inflation peak? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnjmkkpr/ECBFEB1.PNG With ECB rate rise bets piling up and four-five Fed rate hikes discounted already for 2022, the euro bounced off 19-month lows against the greenback and German bond yields rose to the highest since 2019.
If jobs data later on Tuesday shows wage pressures on the rise, Lagarde will, like Lowe, find herself battling markets at the Feb. 3 ECB meeting.
Meanwhile, is it time to call time on the equity selloff? On the last day of January, global stocks managed a 1.7% rebound, led by a 3.5% jump in the Nasdaq. 
For now, a firmer session appears to lie ahead. In Europe, good news continues to trickle in on the earnings front, with UBS the latest bank to post forecast-beating profits and a bumper buyback programme. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
- German retail sales dropped 5.5% in December as COVID curbs bit
-Russia’s Vladimir Putin meets Hungary’s Victor Orban
- India unveils higher infrastructure spending in budget 
-UK house prices post strongest start to year since 2005: Nationwide

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 03:40AM ET</span>",Spanish bank Ibercaja postpones IPO due to market volatility,"MADRID (Reuters) -Spanish bank Ibercaja has postponed an initial public offering (IPO) because of the volatility in international markets, the bank said on Tuesday in a filing to the Madrid market regulator.
Ibercaja's board ""agreed to wait until the markets return to a situation of normality before continuing with its IPO,"" the bank said.
A source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that the plan now was for Ibercaja bank to list its shares on the Madrid stock market in April, delaying it from initially mid-February. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Ibercaja just added that as part of its ongoing IPO preparations, it would move ahead with the presentation of its 2021 annual accounts in the coming weeks.
Spanish authorities gave former savings banks such as Ibercaja until the end of this year to go public or raise money to cut stakes held by foundations under the terms of a bank bailout after the 2012 financial crisis.
Earlier in January, Ibercaja had formally announced its intention to float. 
Ibercaja, which has total assets of 58 billion euros ($66 billion), said then the offering would be for existing shares held by the Ibercaja Foundation, which currently owns a little more than 88% of the bank.
Through the IPO, the foundation would cut its stake in the bank to about 46%.
As banks are struggling with pressure from ultra low interest rates, Ibercaja is aiming to lift its return on tangible equity ratio, a measure of profitability, of currently 7.2% to about 9% in the medium term through cost-cutting measures and fees from its more profitable business areas.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 03:26AM ET</span>",Japan's ANA surprises with small Q3 operating profit but keeps FY loss guidance,"By Maki Shiraki and Jamie Freed
TOKYO (Reuters) -ANA Holdings Inc surprised with a small third-quarter operating profit on Tuesday but Japan's biggest airline still expects a loss for the year, indicating a worse-than-expected fourth quarter as the Omicron variant spreads.
ANA's 100 million yen ($869,716) operating profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was its first in eight quarters and contrasted with the 16.5 billion yen loss forecast by five analysts polled by Refinitiv.
It also beat ANA's target of returning to an operating profit in the fourth quarter.
But the airline, which posted an operating loss of 115.8 billion yen for the first nine months of the financial year, maintained its October forecast for a 125 billion yen full-year loss, pointing to a return to the red in the fourth quarter.
Chief Financial Officer Ichiro Fukuzawa said it was difficult in January to meet its pre-Omicron target of reaching 80% of pre-pandemic domestic passenger numbers and 20% of pre-pandemic international passenger numbers.
""We expect that travel demand during spring vacation and international cargo demand are strong but we still need to take a hard look at the fourth quarter,"" he told reporters. ""This is the reason why we didn't change our forecast for the full year.""
Third quarter domestic passenger numbers rose to around 50% of pre-pandemic levels as Japan lifted a state of emergency, with international passengers at around 10% of pre-pandemic levels due to tight border controls.
ANA benefited from cost cuts and record air cargo revenue and Fukuzawa said it expects the freight market to remain strong in the current quarter.
In the fourth quarter, it faces headwinds from record COVID-19 case numbers.

Japan last week expanded regions subject to tighter coronavirus curbs to cover 70% of the country, as the government tried to counter a wave of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>",Science podcaster calls Spotify's support of Joe Rogan a 'slap in the face',"By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - The executive producer and host of Gimlet Media's Science Vs podcast said she would devote her fact-checking show exclusively to contradicting misinformation on other podcasts carried by parent company Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). 
The announcement by Wendy Zukerman builds on protests by Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and others against Spotify's Joe Rogan Experience Podcast. They say Spotify is not doing enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19 misinformation.
Zukerman posted a copy of an email she sent to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, in which she said she considered the platform's support of Rogan a ""slap in the face,"" after she spent months encouraging her listeners to move to the service because of its support for her fact-based science podcast. 
Spotify acquired Gimlet Media in 2019.
Zukerman wrote that Rogan's interview with Dr Robert Malone, an infectious disease specialist who has become well-known among anti-vaccine Americans, took vaccine information ""repeatedly out of context"" and lacked scientific evidence that contradicts his claims - a topic a forthcoming Science Vs episode will address.
She said that Spotify's platform rules do not go far enough to address the problem.
""Until Spotify implements stronger methods to prevent the spread of misinformation on the platform, we will no longer be making new Science Vs episodes, except those intended to contradict misinformation being spread on Spotify,"" Zukerman wrote in an email to Ek that she posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Rogan's interview with Malone prompted a protest by rock star Neil Young, who said he did not want his music on a platform that promoted ""false information about vaccines.""
He added, ""They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" Folk music star Joni Mitchell removed her music to support Young.
Rogan apologized in an Instagram video post on Sunday and pledged more balance on his show. Spotify said it would add a content advisory to any episode with discussion of COVID. 

Reuters could not immediately reach Gimlet or Spotify for comment. Zukerman's post appeared on her verified Twitter account.
Spotify acquired Gimlet as part of an investment in its podcast business, an expansion of audio content that was underscored with its subsequent deal in 2020 to bring Rogan exclusively to the platform in a reported $100 million deal.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nomura Holdings Inc, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, reported on Tuesday a 38.7% drop in third-quarter net profit as the pandemic-era trading boom waned.
But this is the first time in four quarters that Nomura had no major one-off losses overseas, after a turbulent year when it booked a $2.9 billion hit from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos and a $345 million charge related to legacy transactions. 
October-December profit came in at 60.3 billion yen ($524.70 million), down from 98.4 billion yen a year earlier.
The dismal third-quarter earnings reflected a slowdown in the global markets trading business, which in the previous year had benefited from high trading activity thanks to a massive injection of cash into capital markets by the Federal Reserve.
Partly offsetting the drop in trading revenue, Nomura's investment banking unit made a record quarterly profit, reaping the rewards of a global uptrend in mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
Nomura Greentech, a recently acquired boutique M&A advisor in clean tech, helped boost Nomura's presence in the U.S. market.
Pre-tax income for Nomura's wholesale division, which houses its trading and investment banking businesses, dropped 47% to 40.8 billion yen for the same period a year earlier.
Aiming to draw a line under a long troubled history in its attempts to expand overseas, Nomura is adopting a more stable earnings structure by increasing fees from M&A advisory and from managing clients' assets.
In addition to robust M&A advisory revenue, the quarter saw a 28.1 billion yen revenue from fees for managing clients' assets.
""We are making steady progress in our mid- and long-term strategy, with more stable and diversified revenue,"" Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said at a briefing.

Shares in Nomura have lost about 30% since it revealed the Archegos loss in March, just a few days before the end of its financial year.

""Following ING's decision to exit the French retail banking market, Societe Generale announces that Boursorama has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ING to offer ING's online banking customers in France the best alternative banking solution,"" SocGen and Boursorama said in a statement.
ING had already announced last December that it would leave the French retail banking business while continuing to operate in the country's whole banking business.
""The exact scope of the definitive agreement remains to be specified and would concern daily banking (current accounts and cards), savings and investment products (assurance vie & brokerage)"", ING said in a separate statement.

The two parties intend to reach a final agreement, which would have a very limited impact on SocGen's core equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio, by April 2022.
ING said that, for its workbase of around 460 employees at its French retail business, a plan had been agreed with unions and approved by the French Ministry of Labour.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - 2022 is off to a turbulent start for U.S. stocks.
Even as the market recouped some losses in the last two sessions of the month, the benchmark S&P 500 ended down 5.3% in January, its biggest monthly drop since the pandemic took hold in March 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is in a correction, while the small-cap Russell 2000 confirmed a bear market, dropping over 20% below its November record high.

“In a very simple way, I would call it the tightening tantrum,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""Even though they haven’t even started raising rates yet, I think it has led to investors just having some concern about what it means for the market.”
January's performance could bode poorly for the rest of the year. Since 1950, when the S&P 500 is positive in January, the index has climbed an average of 11.9% for the final 11 months of year, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). However, when January is negative, the S&P 500 historically rises an average of 2.7% in the last 11 months.

In January, investors in particular fled growth stocks, including tech and other names carrying high valuations that rest on future profit growth. The S&P 500 growth index fell 8.4% in January.
Value stocks, which have long underperformed growth, held up better with the S&P 500 value index down only 1.7%. Energy shares, which are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries in an inflationary environment, were standouts, with the energy sector gaining nearly 19% for the month, the only S&P 500 sector in positive territory.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 01:00AM ET</span>","U.S. oil refiners, workers agree to continue labor talks past strike deadline","By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Negotiators for the United Steelworkers union (USW) and U.S. oil and chemical companies late Monday agreed to continue talks on a new contract after a strike deadline passed, according to a message sent to workers and viewed by Reuters. 
The two sides temporarily halted negotiations ahead of the midnight deadline but plan to continue discussion on Tuesday. They agreed to a 24-hour rolling extension to give negotiators time to reach a final agreement, the USW message to workers said. That means the existing labor contract remains in place with a 24-hour notice required to end it. 
The union rejected a 9% pay raise over three years, the message said. The USW represents about 30,000 oil industry workers, many of whose contracts were due to expire shortly after 12 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Tuesday. 
Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)., which is the lead negotiator for oil refiners, pipeline and chemical companies, did not immediately respond to a request for comment after normal business hours on Monday. 
The talks have progressed slowly over the past 2-1/2 weeks but had made enough progress that both sides agreed to continue after the strike deadline, people familiar with the matter said. Company negotiators several times raised their pay offer to workers, the sources said. 
The last nationwide strike by oil workers was in 2015. 
At least four offers were exchanged on Monday, with the latest being a 9% pay raise over the three years of the proposed contract. The first pay offer, made last week, was for 3% over three years, the USW told members in a message last week. 
Marathon has said it is committed to negotiating in good faith with the USW to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement.
The current contract, negotiated in 2019, provided an 11% increase in pay for refinery workers over three years. 
If a strike is called, it likely will follow the pattern of the 2015 stoppage, which began on Feb. 1 of that year and expanded over time to 12 refineries, accounting for a fifth of U.S. crude oil processing capacity, and three chemical plants.

Strikes at several of the refineries continued for weeks after the nationwide strike ended in mid-March, with the longest at Marathon’s Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, ending in early July 2015.
During the 2015 strike, only one refinery shut down but others cut production to 50% of capacity.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 12:56AM ET</span>",U.S. FTC to review Microsoft's $68.7 billion deal for Activision - Bloomberg News,"(Reuters) -The U.S. antitrust review of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $68.7 billion proposed acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) will be handled by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Bloomberg News reported https://bloom.bg/3ALk2Fm late on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
The FTC, instead of the Justice Department, will investigate whether the takeover will harm competition, the report said. 
In a bid to toughen merger guidelines, the FTC and the Justice Department had last month jointly said that industries had become increasingly concentrated and a surge in merger filings in 2020 and 2021 signaled the situation will worsen.
Days later, the FTC voted unanimously to sue to block arms maker  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s proposed $4.4 billion purchase of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) over antitrust concerns.
Microsoft, Activision and FTC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The deal announced by Microsoft in January is its biggest-ever and is set to be the largest all-cash acquisition on record. It will bolster Microsoft's firepower in the booming videogaming market where it takes on leaders Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp.
Meanwhile, Sony said on Monday it will acquire Bungie Inc, the original creator of the ""Halo"" videogame and developer of ""Destiny"", in a deal valued at $3.6 billion, the latest in a wave of consolidations sweeping the gaming sector.
Microsoft has so far avoided the type of scrutiny faced by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Meta Platforms Inc, but this deal, which would make it the world's third largest gaming company, will put the Xbox maker on lawmakers' radars, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard LLC after the deal was announced.

Reuters previously reported that Microsoft would pay a $3 billion break-fee if the deal falls through, according to a source familiar with the matter, suggesting the company was confident of winning antitrust approval.

Automakers worldwide have been roiled by chip shortages, supply chain disruptions, COVID-19 restrictions and rising raw material prices after a short-lived recovery towards the end of 2020.
""Demand remains strong despite near-term concerns... the semiconductor supply situation is improving gradually whilst inflation worries persist,"" Tata Motors said in an exchange filing.
Shares of the company were trading 1.7% lower at 504.05 rupees, as of 0415 GMT. Before results landed on Monday, the stock had jumped more than 4% and settled at 517.75 rupees.
Brokerage Jefferies said in a note that it saw better times for JLR ahead as chip constraints eased, retaining its ""buy"" rating and raising the target price to 635 rupees from 625 rupees.
Tata Motors' consolidated net loss came in at 15.16 billion rupees ($203.23 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of 29.06 billion rupees a year earlier, when an easing of pandemic-related restrictions led to a pick-up in sales.
However, the recovery was short-lived as acute semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions delayed production, and Tata Motors slipped back to losses.
For the reported quarter, analysts had expected the Mumbai-based company to report a loss of 3.30 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Tata Motors' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation margin, a key measure of profitability, was 10.2% for the quarter, above estimates of 9.3%.
The company said it was engaging directly with chip manufacturers to secure longer-term supplies for JLR.

Total revenue from operations for the quarter fell 4.5% to 722.29 billion rupees, below estimates of 775.93 billion rupees.

Shares of the Australia-listed company rose 6.8% to A$6.27 in the biggest intraday percentage gain since June 2021.
The cash distribution will be in the form of a A$2.65 per share equal capital reduction and a A$0.07 per share dividend, Boral said on Tuesday. 
This would also mean that a big chunk of the return will go to its largest shareholder, billionaire media tycoon Kerry Stokes' Seven Group Holdings. 
Seven's shares were also up about 2% after the announcement. 
Seven Group owns nearly 70% of Boral, having built up its stake from nearly 20% in September last year. In July, Boral appointed Seven's boss Ryan Stokes as its chairman.
Boral has been selling its U.S. businesses since 2020 after a seven-year-long spree of offshore acquisitions led to a hefty writedown that year. It most recently sold its North American fly ash business for $755 million.
Its domestic business generates more than half of the revenue and has benefited from record low interest rates boosting property prices to record highs.
""Our reshaped portfolio allows us to focus on strengthening the performance and profitability of our core Australian construction materials business,"" Chief Executive Officer Zlatko Todorcevsk said. 

Boral is expected to report its half-year earnings on Feb. 14.

The plane was overflying Belarus on its way from Athens to Vilnius when Belarus controllers ordered it to land in Minsk, citing a bomb threat. Once it was on the ground, a Belarusian dissident journalist on board the plane was arrested along with his female companion.
Western powers responded with a wave of new sanctions and the United States this month charged four Belarus officials with aircraft piracy.
A United Nations report published on Jan. 17 found that the reported bomb threat had been invented, without identifying the source of the hoax. It said Belarus had withheld crucial information from the U.N. fact-finding team.
Ryanair Group head Michael O'Leary said the airline supported the U.S. action. He welcomed the U.N. report, though he said it ""could have gone further"".
""I think it is fundamental to the future of air travel that we do not have a repetition of what in my mind was the first case since the Chicago Convention (1944) of a state sponsored act of international piracy,"" O'Leary told an investor call. 
""There should be no overflight of Belarus unless appropriate guarantees are obtained that this won't recur.""
Belarus has said it acted legally and in accordance with all international norms, and accused the West of using the episode to try to undermine President Alexander Lukashenko.

The U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) council said on Monday that some members of its governing council expressed concern at gaps in information provided by Belarus and inconsistencies contained in the evidence available at the time of the investigation.
The council asked the ICAO investigation team to continue trying to establish missing facts and to report any further findings, the agency said in a release.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, at the end of a volatile month for Wall Street where the tech-heavy Nasdaq narrowly avoided its worst ever start to the year and the S&P 500 recorded its weakest January performance since 2009.
Valuations of growth and technology stocks have come under increasing scrutiny, as investors fretted about companies trading at lofty valuations at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to begin raising interest rates to combat inflation and withdraw its pandemic stimulus measures.
In early Monday trading, the Nasdaq was on course to surpass its worst opening-month performance on record, when it fell 9.89% in 2008. However, after its best one-day gain since March 2021, it closed out January down 8.99%.
""At the end of the day, interest rates are going to have to move higher, and companies with high multiples will have to trade lower,"" said Decio Nascimento, chief investment officer of Norbury Partners.
He added that, with costs such as wages rising, there will be increased investor focus on sectors that can better handle those inflationary pressures, with less latitude for companies which promise future growth but which currently generate negative cash flow.
All of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, led by a 3.8% rise in consumer discretionary stocks. The gain was led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which jumped 10.7% after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised the electric car maker's stock rating to ""outperform"".
For January though, consumer discretionary was the worst performing sector, slipping 9.7%. In all, only the energy sector ended the month in positive territory, aided by oil prices hitting their highest level since October 2014 on Friday. [O/R]
Overall, the bellwether S&P 500 had its worst overall month since the pandemic-led crash in March 2020.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last week signaled it intends to combat the four-decade high inflation by hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many market participants expected.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing in almost five rate increases by year-end, with some banks, such as the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) now eyeing seven hikes this year.
""What the Fed did last week was to widen the spectrum of possibility of what rates could be in a year or two, so when you do that, you are going to create volatility in equities"" said Norbury Partners' Nascimento.
Geopolitical tensions have added to market uncertainty, with the U.S. and its allies threatening Russia with new economic sanctions if it attacks Ukraine.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 406.39 points, or 1.17%, to 35,131.86, the S&P 500 gained 83.7 points, or 1.89%, to 4,515.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 469.31 points, or 3.41%, to 14,239.88.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 5.1%. The U.S. planemaker secured a launch order from Qatar Airways for a new freighter version of its 777X passenger jet and a provisional order for 737 MAX jets.
Citrix Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CTXS)'s shares fell 3.4% after the software company said it had agreed to be taken private for $16.5 billion including debt by affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.67 billion shares, compared with the 12.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 30 new highs and 45 new lows.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday disclosed a sweeping restructuring of its global operations that will combine its refining and chemicals businesses into one, and put its energy transition business on the same footing as its other operations. 
The broad restructuring marks its latest cost-cutting effort after activist investors seeking to boost returns and address the energy transition won three seats last spring on its board. Exxon vowed to cut $6 billion from operating costs by next year after suffering a historic $22.4 billion loss in 2020.
The changes were first considered around 2017, Exxon Senior Vice President Jack P. Williams told Reuters. Around that time, Exxon combined its fuels and lubricants division with supply and refining Three top businesses lines: Upstream, Products and Low Carbon. 
""It's an evolution,"" said Williams. ""We have been working on it now for a while."" 
Putting its low carbon business on the same level as its two major businesses allows Exxon more flexibility to redirect investments as the company adjusts to the energy transition, Williams said.
Exxon shares rose nearly 1% to $75.96 on Monday. 
NO JOB CUTS ANTICIPATED
The restructuring will not affect fourth quarter financial results, which the top U.S. producer reports on Tuesday. Exxon does not anticipate cutting any jobs as a result of the restructuring, said spokesperson Erin McGrath.
Among the changes: Karen McKee, head of Exxon Chemical, will run the combined refining and chemicals unit, called  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Product Solutions. Those businesses contributed about a fifth of operating profit in 2019.
Linda DuCharme, president of Exxon Mobil Upstream Integrated Solutions and Upstream Business Development, will lead Exxon Technology and Engineering, the company said. That unit will develop new technologies to support the oil and gas, petrochemicals and low carbon businesses. 
Exxon's largest business, its oil and gas production, will be consolidated into a global organization called Exxon Mobil Upstream. It will be led by Liam Mallon, former chief of its Upstream Oil and Gas unit. That business accounted for $14.42 billion of operating profit in 2019. 
Its energy transition business, called Low Carbon Solutions, shares equal stature with Exxon's oil and gas and petrochemical operations. That business was formed last March to commercialize biofuels and carbon storage. 
""Aligning our businesses along market-focused value chains and centralizing service delivery, provides the flexibility to ensure our most capable resources are applied to the highest corporate priorities,"" Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said. 
PROFIT REBOUND 
Past cost-cutting moves and higher oil prices are expected to deliver a quarterly per share profit of $1.93, up from an adjusted profit of three cents a share a year-ago. Profit for the full year could be the highest since 2014, analysts estimate. 

The restructuring also combines several technology and engineering operations which had been assigned to individual business units. The new, single technology organization will be called Exxon Mobil Technology and Engineering, Exxon said.
Exxon also will relocate its corporate headquarters from Irving, Texas, to its campus north of Houston. That move is expected to be completed in mid 2023.

(Reuters) -Sony Interactive Entertainment will acquire Bungie Inc, the original creator of the ""Halo"" videogame and developer of ""Destiny"", in a deal valued at $3.6 billion, making it the latest in a wave of consolidations sweeping the gaming sector.
Bungie will join  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation family, the U.S. company said in a blog post, as the Japanese conglomerate strengthens its network of in-house gaming studios behind hits such as ""Spider-Man"" to take on cash-rich rivals. 
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose XBox consoles have long lagged Sony's PlayStation in sales, pitched a whopping $69 billion for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) earlier in January. 
""While this is one of Sony's biggest-ever acquisitions, the amount paid by Microsoft puts into context the heavy competition faced in this sector,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis.
Bellevue, Washington-based Bungie, which was owned by Microsoft before going private in 2007, had worked on the ""Halo"" videogame series when it was under the software giant. It has also worked on titles including ""Marathon"" and ""Myth"". 
Bungie now plans to hire more talent across the studio for ""Destiny 2,"" a videogame previously published by Activision Blizzard. 
The video game space is consolidating rapidly to tap a surge in demand created by the pandemic, with new deals blurring the line between PC and mobile gaming companies as these firms hunt for new revenue streams.
The sector is on course for a new record of $150 billion in deals, financing and IPOs this year, according https://www.reuters.com/technology/red-hot-gaming-market-breach-150-billion-deals-fundraising-report-2022-01-31 to investment banking firm Drake Star Partners. 
In yet another mega deal in just the first month of the year, ""Grand Theft Auto"" maker Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) bid $11 billion for ""FarmVille"" maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). 
Big-name companies have also been trying to bring talent and intellectual property behind popular titles in-house rather than partnering with studios, giving them more access in a growing, high-value market. 
Sony has added a number of developers, including videogame development studio Valkyrie Entertainment and ""Returnal"" developer Housemarque, under its umbrella.

""This (Bungie deal) is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience,"" said Jim Ryan, head of the Sony Corp (T:6758) unit responsible for PlayStation.
Bungie will be an independent unit of Sony Interactive Entertainment, run by its board chaired by CEO Pete Parsons (NYSE:PSN).

WASHINGTON/LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States and Britain are prepared to punish Russian elites close to President Vladimir Putin with asset freezes and travel bans if Russia enters Ukraine, Washington and London said on Monday as tensions also spilled over at the United Nations.
Britain urged Putin to ""step back from the brink"" after the Russian build-up of troops near Ukraine stoked fears of war, and warned any incursion would trigger sanctions against companies and people close to the Kremlin.
""The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin's destabilizing behavior,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said planned legislation will give London new powers to target companies linked to the Russian state.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the British warning ""very disturbing,"" saying it made Britain less attractive to investors and would hurt British companies.
""An attack by a given country on Russian business implies retaliatory measures, and these measures will be formulated based on our interests if necessary,"" Peskov said.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, London has become the haven of choice for a river of money from Russia and other former Soviet republics. Transparency advocates have long called on Britain to be tougher about illicit financial flows.
PUBLIC FACE-OFF
Tensions between Russia and the United States were on display at the United Nations Security Council on Monday where the U.S.-requested meeting on Moscow's troop build-up allowed for a public face-off over the crisis.
Russia's U.N. ambassador said there was ""no proof"" Moscow was planning military action and that Russia had never confirmed the West's assertion that it had amassed 100,000 troops near its neighbor.
Vassily Nebenzia said U.S. talk of war was ""provocative,"" that Russia frequently deployed troops in its own territory, and that Ukraine's crisis was a domestic issue. 
""The provocation's from Russia, not from us or other members of this council,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 
China urged all parties to not aggravate the situation and said it did not view Russia's troops near the border as a threat.
Although Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs pro-Russian rebels fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, denies planning further incursion, it is demanding sweeping security guarantees including a promise NATO never admit Ukraine.
It sent a follow-up to a written proposal made by the United States last week, according to the State Department. Washington did not comment on Monday on the content of the response, saying ""it would be unproductive to negotiate in public.""
Meanwhile, leaders are continuing their diplomatic push with phone calls and meetings to try to defuse the situation.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set travel to Ukraine on Tuesday to meet with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
On a call between French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin, the pair said they wanted to maintain a dialogue on implementing the Minsk agreements regarding Donbass, a region of eastern Ukraine where Moscow has backed separatist fighters. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to speak by phone with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, a State Department spokesperson said. 
RUSSIAN MONEY ABROAD
Opponents of Putin have long urged the West to clamp down on Russian money, though oligarchs and Russian officials continue to flaunt wealth at Europe's most luxurious destinations.
""Putin's cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions,"" said a senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the West and attending elite Western universities."" 
Britain has already imposed sanctions on about 180 people and 48 entities since Russia annexed Crimea, including six people it says are close to Putin. The sanctions allow Britain to bar people from entering and to freeze their assets.
The European Union, many of whose members are in NATO, has also threatened ""strong political consequences and massive economic costs"" for Russia over any new incursion into Ukraine.
Some NATO countries, including the United States and Britain, have sent arms to Ukraine, although they have ruled out sending troops there to fight. 
Poland said it had offered neighboring Ukraine tens of thousands of munitions, and was awaiting a reply. The White House on Monday accused Russia of surging troops into Belarus, which is hosting Russian drills and borders both Poland and Ukraine.

Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies weakens the West's hand, and the United States has asked top gas producer Qatar and other major exporters to study whether they can supply more to Europe.
U.S. President Joe Biden met with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Monday at the Oval Office and said he planned to designate the Middle Eastern nation a major non-NATO ally.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Thirteen U.S. states and two Latin America and Caribbean nations on Monday threw their support behind a lawsuit from Mexico that accuses several major U.S. gun makers of facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels, leading to thousands of deaths.
The states and the countries of Antigua and Barbuda and Belize filed separate briefs urging a federal judge in Boston to not dismiss Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against companies including Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co.
The companies have argued Mexico has failed to establish its harms were attributable to them and that a U.S. law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, protected gun makers from lawsuits over their products' misuse.
Mexico's lawyers in a filing on Monday countered that the law only precludes lawsuits over injuries that occur in the United States and would not shield the companies from allegations over the trafficking of guns to Mexican criminals.
Democratic attorneys general from 13 states including Massachusetts, California and New York along with the District of Columbia agreed, saying even if that law applied extraterritorially, the statute would not bar Mexico's claims.
Representatives for the companies did not respond to requests for comment. Other defendants include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt's Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc.
In a lawsuit filed in August, Mexico claimed the companies undermined its strict gun laws by designing, marketing and distributing military-style assault weapons in ways they knew would arm drug cartels, fueling murders, extortions and kidnappings.

Mexico's lawsuit said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the manufacturers it sued.
Lawyers for Antigua and Barbuda and Belize argued countries in their region had likewise faced violent gun crimes and that U.S. gun manufacturers ""must not be permitted to hold hostage the law-abiding citizens of an entire region of the world.""

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) -Qatar Airways handed Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co a record launch order for 34 new 777X freighters and a surprise purchase of 737 MAX passenger jets on Monday, in a $30 billion-plus package as President Joe Biden hailed the Gulf state as a major U.S. ally.
The deal, signed at the White House during a visit to Washington by Qatar's ruling emir, boosted Boeing at a time when the U.S. planemaker faces chronic industrial and financial constraints. The order drove Boeing shares up to close 5.1% higher. 
The deal for 25 of the largest version of the MAX, the 737-10, plus 25 further options, widened the fallout from a dispute between Qatar Airways and Airbus . 
The European planemaker earlier this month revoked a contract with Qatar Airways for 50 competing A321neo jets as part of a spiraling dispute that began with disagreements over the severity of flaws on long-haul A350 jets.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said Qatari and U.S. aircraft and engine negotiators had ""lost a lot of sleep"" in the intervening two weeks to shape an alternative deal, and contrasted that with a recent plunge in relations with Airbus. 
""We like to build long-term relationships with trusted partners where both parties work together towards a common purpose,"" he told a White House signing ceremony attended by leaders from Boeing and engine maker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
Airbus declined comment.
The total order included 34 of a newly launched freighter version of the 777X passenger plane, plus 16 options, and two more of the current-generation freighter, the 777F. Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/qatar-airways-order-up-50-boeing-737-max-source-2022-01-31 the 737 MAX deal earlier on Monday.
The freight part of the deal represents the first order for a cargo spin-off of the 777X, the world's largest twin-engine passenger plane whose entry to service has been delayed more than three years to late 2023 or beyond. 
Boeing said the freighter would enter service in 2027.
It is banking on sales of the new twin-engined juggernaut to defend its dominance of the cargo market and head off a challenge from a new Airbus A350 freighter.
""(The 777X) will be an absolute world-beater,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said.
ORDER CONVERSIONS
To win the freighter order, Boeing agreed to convert a third of Qatar's existing order for 60 777X passenger planes, for which there is currently less demand, to the cargo version.
Al Baker played up support for the U.S. economy from Qatar Airways, which has faced trade complaints in the past from U.S. carriers over alleged subsidies - a practise it denies.
For Boeing, the deal marks a respite from a recent safety crisis over the MAX and delays with the 777X passenger jet and 787 Dreamliner, and a chance to win points for its own economic contribution after intense regulatory and political scrutiny.
Qatar Airways had criticized the MAX and urged Boeing to design an all-new jet after crashes led to a lengthy grounding, but sales have rebounded since it was re-cleared in late 2020. 
The Airbus A321neo continues to dominate sales in the part of the market served by the largest MAX variant, however.
Boeing said the freighter order would sustain more than 35,000 U.S. jobs with an annual economic impact of $2.6 billion.
Boeing has dominated air freight for years through its 767, 777 and 747 cargo jets, though it will be urgently pressing for more orders for the new freighter flagship.
About half of global cargo by value travels by air, and in turn half of that usually goes in the belly of passenger planes. 

During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to park unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space at a time when e-commerce has been a lifeline for many.
But economists warn the trends could start to unravel as the pandemic eases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -World stocks climbed higher on Monday as investors digested new optimism from the U.S. Treasury's top economist that inflationary pressures should ease in 2022 due to weaker demand for goods, easing supply bottlenecks and a receding coronavirus pandemic.
Wall Street closed higher on Monday, coupled with an earlier rise in European shares, that helped stabilize investor sentiment after a series of volatile sessions.
In a statement released alongside the Treasury's quarterly borrowing estimates, Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Ben Harris said he expects energy prices to stabilize in 2022, but geopolitical instability could push prices higher.
Still, investors said the backdrop for equities remains uncertain as other central banks tighten policy - the Bank of England is expected to hike rates again on Thursday - and another jolt higher in oil prices adds to inflationary worries.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.72%.
Lunar New Year holidays made for thin trading conditions in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.11% higher.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.89%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added 3.41%, but has borne the brunt of selling and is down 14% from a record peak last year.
The MSCI World index, while higher on Monday, remains down 6.2% in January - the worst start to the year since 2016. Before Friday's rebound, the index had been headed for its worst January since the global financial crisis in 2008. It last gained 1.8%
""This is not the classic selloff affecting lower quality underperforming companies. This selloff is driven not by fundamentals but by the action of central banks at a time when growth is very strong,"" said Flavio Carpenzano, investment director at Capital Group.
""For years you were like a spoiled child, you could get all the money you wanted and for free and you could buy what you wanted, you didn't care that much about quality. Now it's the other way round, you have to be more disciplined so you need to look carefully at valuation,"" Carpenzano added.
The standoff over Ukraine also remains a thorn in the markets' side, with concerns a Russian invasion would cut vital gas supplies to Western Europe. Moscow denies any plan to invade.
OIL STEADY
Oil prices ended January about 17% higher in their biggest monthly gain in a year, boosted by a supply shortage and political tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. [O/R]
The most-active Brent contract, for April delivery, traded 74 cents higher, or 0.8%, to settle at $89.26 per barrel. The front-month contract, for March delivery, which expired at the end of the session, rose $1.18, or 1.3%, to finish at $91.21.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.33, or 1.5%, to close at $88.15 a barrel. 
In economic news, data showed euro zone economic growth slowed quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2021, as expected.
Data out on Sunday showed China's factory activity slowed in January as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and tough lockdowns hit production and demand.
Yields of U.S. Treasuries that are most sensitive to inflation expectations hovered near their highest levels since February 2020 on Monday, capping a bond market selloff this month that by some measures is the worst in 13 years.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 0.9 basis points to 1.789%, while the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 0.5 basis points at 1.177%
""The bond market may have settled into a flattening yield curve, reflecting an outlook for several rate hikes over the course of this year and then at least a pause as the economy adjusts,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.
As well as the Bank of England, the European Central Bank meets this week but is expected to stick to its argument that inflation will recede over time.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 06:55PM ET</span>",Sacklers near deal to increase opioid settlement in Purdue bankruptcy,"By Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP are nearing an agreement to boost their more than $4 billion offer to resolve sprawling opioid litigation after negotiating with states that had objected to terms of the OxyContin maker's bankruptcy reorganization, according to a court filing.
Sackler family members and states objecting to terms of Purdue's bankruptcy reorganization are ""close to an agreement in principle"" to contribute additional cash beyond the $4.325 billion they had pledged to settle opioid litigation, according to a mediator's interim report filed on Monday.
An agreement involving members of the Sackler family and several state attorneys general could potentially end a legal challenge that has prevented Purdue from exiting bankruptcy, and clear the way for a plan aimed at helping to abate the opioid crisis. 
The mediation kicked off in January among Sackler family members and several states after a U.S. district judge overturned the original settlement, which was the cornerstone of Purdue's bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
The judge found the reorganization plan improperly shielded Sackler family members, who had not filed for Chapter 11 themselves, from opioid litigation. 
The mediator, former U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, said any additional contribution from the Sacklers would be solely for opioid abatement. She asked that talks be extended to Feb. 7, a request that could be considered at a bankruptcy-court hearing on Tuesday.
The report described marathon negotiating sessions held on Jan. 25-26 in New York that ran more than 12 hours each day and involved two unidentified state attorneys general who participated in person and another who joined by Zoom.
The settlement agreement had been opposed by at least eight state attorneys general, including Bob Ferguson in Washington state and William Tong in Connecticut. 
Purdue, the maker of the highly addictive OxyContin opioid painkiller, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sacklers of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing. The opioid abuse crisis has led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to U.S. data.

Sackler family members have denied wrongdoing. Purdue pleaded guilty in November 2020 to three felonies arising from its handling of OxyContin. 
Several members of the Sackler family testified during Purdue's bankruptcy trial that their contribution to the settlement was conditioned on receiving ""global peace"" from opioid litigation.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 06:35PM ET</span>",Melvin Capital's Plotkin eyes new cash after year of double-digit losses,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that lost nearly $7 billion early last year by betting stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) would tumble, wants to raise money for a new portfolio, according to a regulatory filing made on Monday.
The new fund will be called Melvin Capital Long Only LP and the filing did not say when fundraising will begin. The fund's name suggests that it will bet stocks will rise not fall and that the portfolio will not be hedged.
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
The new launch comes at a critical time for Gabriel Plotkin, Melvin's founder, who had established himself as one of Wall Street's most gifted traders before a band of retail investors ganged up on the firm last year to inflict heavy losses.
After losing 39% in 2021, Plotkin is trying to win back investors' trust but without employing a strategy Wall Street thought he was especially good at - selling stocks short.
""Launching a hedge fund strategy which doesn't (appear to) hedge is puzzling,"" said Max Gokhman, chief investment officer at hedge fund Alpha TrAI. Markets will likely be turbulent which will ""require nimbleness to tactically go long and short, not just to maximize alpha but to minimize risk as well.""
Markets, fueled by fears of rising interest rates and geopolitical turmoil between Russia and Ukraine, have already hurt Melvin and other hedge funds at the start of 2022. Melvin lost 17% in the first three weeks of January, according to a source familiar with the losses.
The sharp drop mirrors Melvin's performance last January when the fund lost about 54% and was not able to wipe the losses away by year's end.
Plotkin had been betting since 2014 that GameStop's shares would tumble as the world shifts away from the bricks and mortar video retailer's offerings.
But when retail investors banded together to support the stock, sending it surging more than 2,500% in January 2021, Melvin and others suffered. By the end of January Plotkin had closed the short position on GameStop.
He tried to wipe out the losses, which took a bite out of his record where he had posted average gains of 30% a year between 2014 and 2020.
Now investors worry Plotkin's new fund might signal that he has lost the nerve to short, the very thing that allows hedge funds to promise clients a way to ride out tumbling markets.
Additionally, investors worry it is a tough time to raise fresh cash for a fund with a tainted record even as investors signal to other managers that they may wish to rotate cash out of technology-oriented funds into ones that bet on forgotten and less expensive stocks.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 06:16PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Televisa, Univision to launch Spanish-language streaming platform in first half","By Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcast powerhouse Grupo Televisa and U.S. based Univision are preparing to launch what would be the biggest Spanish-language streaming platform in the world in the first half of 2022 after sealing a joint venture deal on Monday, the head of Televisa told Reuters.
The new firm, TelevisaUnivision, will combine content from both broadcasters to target the global Spanish-speaking audience of nearly 600 million people. 
An advertising-based version of the streaming platform will roll out in the first half and a subscription-based product will launch in the second half, Televisa Co-Chief Executive Alfonso de Angoitia said in an interview. 
The yet-to-be named streaming platform enters a crowded field of heavyweight competitors including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Plus and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which last year announced it would spend $300 million on original Mexican productions.
De Angoitia, who will be executive chairman of the TelevisaUnivision board, insisted the platform could break away from the pack, pointing to Televisa's massive content library and broadcast rights for sports. 
""We will be a fierce competitor,"" he said, adding that at least one ""high quality"" new movie or series will drop every week on the subscription service in the first year. 
Customers in Mexico and the United States will simultaneously have first access to the platform before it rolls out in other Latin American countries and Spain. 
A sort of turf war got underway after news of the TelevisaUnivision plan went public in April. Televisa snatched away executives from Netflix, Disney Plus and others. Competitors rushed to poach top stars, leading Televisa to make its contracts with talent more competitive and exclusive, De Angoitia said. 
U.S. singer and actor Selena Gomez, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, Spanish author Maria Duenas and Mexican comedian Eugenio Derbez are among those working on productions for the platform. 
The new firm will generate enough free cash flow to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in more content, De Angoitia said.
The finalization of the TelevisaUnivision deal comes on the heels of a tumultuous week in Mexico's telecoms sector. A highly anticipated vote by the country's Federal Telecommunications Institute left  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), the country's largest telecoms company, without a coveted license to enter the country's pay TV sector, a prospect that had rattled competitors including Televisa, the current industry leader. 
""In the telecommunications sector, we have not seen effective competition yet.... it's not the right time to grant that change to America Movil,"" De Angoitia said, adding that the IFT ""could do more"" to regulate competition.
A pay TV entrance by America Movil, already dominant in mobile and internet services, would make it ""increasingly difficult to compete,"" De Angoitia said.
The TelevisaUnivision deal is partially financed by a $1 billion Series C preferred investment led by the SoftBank Latin American Fund, with participation from ForgeLight, The Raine Group, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which also assisted with technology and engineers.

Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) last week announced the departure of its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, following a fallout over pay. Claure will retain his seat on Univision's board, De Angoitia said.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 05:40PM ET</span>","Elliott, Vista Equity take Citrix private in $16.5 billion deal","By Chavi Mehta and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -Software company Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) said on Monday it would be taken private for $16.5 billion including debt by affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners, which are seeking to tap the pandemic-driven boom in cloud computing.
The company said its shareholders would get $104 per share, implying an equity value of nearly $13 billion and confirming a Reuters report from Sunday about the joint bid.
The deal, expected to be completed by mid-2022, will combine Citrix with Vista's data analytics firm TIBCO Software. Vista will own about 65% of the combined company after closing, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Elliott and Vista believe the public market didn't fully recognize Citrix's annual recurring revenue growth and by combining the two players in the enterprise software space, it can cross-sell products to a highly overlapped customer base of 400,000 enterprise customers in 100 countries.
The deal represents a 24.3% premium to Citrix's close on Dec. 20, when talks of a deal were first reported, but is lower than its Friday close.
""Today's announcement is the culmination of a strategic review process conducted over five months,"" Citrix interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Calderoni said in a statement.
Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Citrix started focusing more on cloud computing only in recent years, providing remote work solutions and networking software for businesses.
Elliott's Jesse Cohn joined the company's board in 2015, when the hedge fund urged Citrix to spin off some units and buy back shares, before stepping down in 2020.
However, Citrix's failure to capitalize on the rise of virtual working during the COVID-19 pandemic lead to its stock plunging 23% last year.
""In the middle of a significant business model transformation, going private is often the best opportunity to have the runway to grow,"" said Daniel Newman, an analyst at Futurum Research. 
Private equity players have recently increased their stakes in the cloud-based software space. The deal also signals a strong market for leveraged buyouts as Elliott and Vista secured committed financing of $15 billion from a consortium of banks. 

Newman likened Citrix's deal to KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) and Clayton Dubilier & Rice taking Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) private for $4.7 billion last year, as the firm struggled to make money and grow.
Shares of Citrix were down 3.4% at $101.94 on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Lockheed Martin on Monday announced that a future U.S. Air Force midair refueling tanker would be made in Alabama and Georgia, potentially creating 1,300 new jobs between the two sites, if it wins the contract for the aircraft.
Expansion and hiring at existing sites in Mobile, Alabama, and Marietta, Georgia, for the next U.S. tanker is contingent upon the award, which is expected in late 2024 or in 2025, Larry Gallogly, director of the LMXT tanker program for  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Aeronautics, told reporters on Monday.
In June the Air Force began surveying the aircraft industry to determine whether another manufacturer had the capacity or interest to make the next installment of midair refueling tankers similar to the recently purchased KC-46.
Lockheed has teamed up with France's Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) in the contest, which uses an Airbus commercial plane as the basis for the tanker.
The plan is to first produce the LMXT as an A330 airliner at Airbus' current Mobile, Alabama, facility, which has 15,000 employees, then modify the jets at a Lockheed plant in Marietta that currently has 5,000 employees. It would be the first time that an Airbus wide-body jet has been assembled outside Europe. 
Lockheed said the 1,300 new jobs would be split between the two sites if it won the contract.
The Air Force has sought to replace hundreds of Eisenhower-era KC-135 tankers still in service in three lots. The first tranche was the Boeing-made KC-46 Pegasus, which has been plagued by performance challenges, including defects with an on-board video system and the boom that connects the tanker to aircraft seeking refueling. 

The Air Force's June announcement kicked off the competition for the second tranche of 140 to 160 jets which would follow the Boeing (NYSE:BA) contract to produce 179 KC-46 Pegasus planes. Boeing is competing for that second tranche as well. A third tranche is expected to be announced in the 2030s 
Airbus won a $35 billion contract in 2008 to build tankers for the Air Force. But the deal was overturned amid political pressure and the Air Force repeated the competition, which Boeing ultimately won for 179 of its 767-based tankers.

Investing.com — According to a report by CNBC on Monday,  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) has cut its sales forecasts for its apparel business.
The report said documents obtained by CNBC revealed momentum in the division is fading, following a doubling of revenue from 2020 to 2021.
While the apparel division of Peloton is just a small portion of the company's business, CNBC said it ""gives yet another glimpse into how the connected fitness company rode a wave of heightened demand in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.""
Citing a Peloton internal presentation, the article said Peloton's apparel unit recorded $41 million in revenue in the fiscal year 2020, while in the fiscal year 2021, Covid related comfort trends saw it achieve tremendous growth, with demand outpacing supply. As a result, in FY 2021, it is said to have achieved $107 million in revenue.
However, after initially forecasting apparel sales of $200 million for FY 2022, the company believes it will now be closer to $150 million due to ""macro factors"" such as supply chain constraints.
Peloton shares are up more than 6% Monday, with the latest news not seeming to have sparked a move to the downside. 
In contrast, on Jan. 20, Peloton shares plunged 23% on a report from CNBC that the company was temporarily halting production of its connected fitness products due to fading demand. However, the company quickly came out soon after stating the rumor was false and for the following two days, Peloton shares rose."

(NYSE:JPM) strategists led by Marko Kolanovic say it’s time to buy beaten-down stocks such as small caps after those companies priced in an economic recession that’s unlikely to come true.  
“Many market metrics such as recent performance of high vs. low beta stocks and valuations of small caps are already fully pricing in a recession -- something we do not see materializing,” Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients. “The equity market sell-off is overdone in our view, and we reiterate our call to buy the dip, particularly in cyclicals and small caps.”
Read: Bearish Bets on Small Caps Ease With Analysts Seeing More Gains
Stocks rebounded Monday, after concern over Federal Reserve tightening sent equity benchmarks to one of the worst starts of a year in decades. The Russell 2000 of smaller companies advanced more than 2%, extending a similar bounce from Friday. Last week, the index entered a bear market as a selloff from its record topped 20%.
Kolanovic, a steadfast equity bull who favors cheap, economically sensitive stocks, said investor fear of a Fed policy mistake is misplaced. While JPMorgan now anticipates the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates seven times through March 2023, he expects the backdrop of above-trend economic expansion and corporate earnings to help the market weather the hit from the valuation front. 
“While jitters around a Fed hiking cycle are understandable, this has been magnified by technical factors that can change quickly,” he wrote. “We could see a reversal of systematic outflows, pickup in buyback activity.”

ROME (Reuters) -Italy's Treasury is pushing for a change at the helm of Monte dei Paschi (MPS) of which it owns 64%, as the bailed-out lender prepares to tap markets for cash, three sources close to the matter said.
The Treasury late last year refused to meet https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/italy-unicredit-talks-monte-paschi-purchase-collapse-2021-10-24 terms set by Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit to agree to an acquisition of its ailing rival, in a setback for Rome's re-privatisation plans.
The collapse of talks with UniCredit has prompted the Treasury to seek an extension of an end-2021 deadline to return MPS into private hands.
Italy is discussing with European Union competition authorities a new restructuring plan for MPS and a new deadline that sources have told Reuters will be past 2023 https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/italy-talks-with-eu-delay-mps-privatisation-beyond-2023-sources-say-2021-12-01.
In the meantime, MPS must raise cash by selling new shares to bolster its capital reserves after emerging as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in last summer's industry stress tests run by European banking supervisors.
The sources said the Treasury had stepped up pressure on MPS CEO Guido Bastianini to quit after the failure of the UniCredit negotiations. 
The sources said Bastianini had been informed earlier this month of the Treasury's intentions, but was resisting pressure to step down. MPS declined to comment. The Treasury did not reply to requests for comment.
Among possible candidates to replace Bastianini, the Treasury favours former BPER CEO Alessandro Vandelli, two of the sources said.
MPS, which is Italy's fourth-largest bank, has said it has plans to raise 2.5 billion euros https://www.reuters.com/article/monte-dei-paschi-plan-idUSKBN2IW1YU from a share sale this year.

Italy, which rescued MPS in 2017 at a cost to taxpayers of 5.4 billion euros, will pump more money into it under the cash call, but EU rules on state aid for banks require MPS to also secure a contribution from private investors.
Deemed too big to be wound down by regulators, MPS has for years been at the fore of Italy's banking crisis.

The Moderna vaccine has been authorized for emergency use in the United States since December 2020, and will now be sold under the brand name Spikevax.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's COVID-19 shot using similar technology received full approval in the United States last year for people aged 16 and older after also first gaining emergency authorization.
Nearly 75 million people have already received Moderna's two-dose vaccine in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""The public can be assured that Spikevax meets the FDA’s high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality required of any vaccine approved for use in the United States,"" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a statement. 
Moderna's vaccine is cleared for use in more than 70 countries, including Canada and the European Union.
In June 2021, the company asked for its vaccine to be authorized for use in 12- to 17-year-olds, but the FDA has yet to respond.
Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis, particularly among young men.

Some studies have suggested https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-covid-19-shot-more-likely-cause-heart-inflammation-than-pfizers-study-2021-12-17 that Moderna's vaccine is more likely to cause the side effect than the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 12:17PM ET</span>",Union battle unfolds at GM in Mexico ahead of workers' vote,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - More than 6,000 General Motors (NYSE:GM) workers in Mexico will elect a new union this week as an upstart group supported by international activists aims to beat one of Mexico's biggest labor organizations that held the contract for 25 years. 
The vote is one of the first under a labor reform that underpins a new trade deal with Canada and the United States, and aims to help improve pay by breaking the grip of unions that critics say signed deals with companies behind workers' backs.
Also under the law, workers at state oil company Pemex elect a new union chief on Monday in their first ever direct vote. 
The GM vote, set for Tuesday and Wednesday at the pickup truck plant in the central city of Silao, comes after workers in August dissolved their contract with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). The vote was monitored by U.S. officials, who threatened to impose tariffs on GM exports under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal if the automaker did not protect worker rights.
The U.S. government is watching Silao again.
The vote by nearly 6,300 workers could set the tone for GM's other Mexican plants and throughout Mexico's auto industry, which is largely dominated by unions that experts say have reputations for protecting business interests and depressing wages.
GM said it is ""aware of the importance of this exercise for our workers"" and will work with the winning group.
Many workers want to push out CTM, which has held the Silao contract since the plant opened in 1995 and is aligned with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that ruled Mexico for decades.
The CTM union booted out last year has given way to a separate CTM faction that is asking workers to be open-minded.
""They satanize CTM because the last union didn't do things as they should have,"" said CTM member David Limon. 
The rival independent union, SINTTIA, which many workers want in place of CTM, grew out of a movement that urged workers to reject their contract last year, gaining a large following that has boosted its chances of victory.
Two other unions are also competing.
Mexico's labor reform calls for contract ratification votes to take place by May 2023 and open the door to new unions.
Yet out of more than 3,000 votes so far, workers have rejected only 25 contracts, underscoring the difficulty of changing an entrenched system, experts say.
The Washington-based Solidarity Center, which is allied with the U.S. AFL-CIO labor federation, and Canadian union Unifor are supporting SINTTIA, which has visited worker neighborhoods, pasted flyers on telephone poles and circulated text messages.
""CTM only looks out for its own personal interests,"" SINTTIA told supporters via WhatsApp.
UNION BATTLE
That argument resonates with employee German, 49, who wants his retirement pension a decade from now to reflect what will amount to 36 years of service at GM.
""If we go back to CTM, it will be the same, all this work will have been for nothing,"" said German, who, like other employees, asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation.
Many workers who backed the prior CTM contract formed La Coalicion, or The Coalition, which critics say has ties to CTM. Last week dozens of supporters gathered outside the plant, chanting ""Beat it, SINTTIA!""
CTM and a final contender, the Carrillo Puerto union, have also criticized SINTTIA, as rumors circulate that workers could lose their jobs if they support the rival group – an oft-used tactic in Mexico to discourage organizing.
Each group vows to push for raises in a country where wages have stagnated for years, and where inflation is now biting.
""We feel very squeezed ... our salary isn't enough with these prices,"" said Juan Ramon Gasca, 33.
Manufacturing workers in Mexico make one-tenth of their U.S. peers, noted Catherine Feingold, AFL-CIO International Director.
""This creates poverty for workers in Mexico and unfair competition that hurts workers in the U.S.,"" she said.
U.S. lawmakers have echoed those concerns, urging GM and Mexican officials to guarantee a fair vote.
Worker attitudes are shifting.

Juan, 38, is backing SINTTIA but will push back if the union fails to deliver.
""We have the right to raise our hand and say, 'you know what, this union didn't work for us',"" he said.

The vaccine has been available under Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. since December 2020. Under this, the vaccine is applied in an emergency scenario when alternatives are available.
Moderna is also working on mRNA vaccines to treat tuberculosis, cardiac as well as other serious health ailments.
The company declared its third-quarter numbers in November. July to September revenue jumped nearly 32 times to $5 billion. It swung to a net profit of $3.33 billion from a loss of $233 million in the same quarter a year ago.
It has guided for 2022 sales to come in between $17 billion and $22 billion with 2021 product sales seen at $15 billion-$18 billion. Deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine in the year through December 2021 are seen between 700 million and 800 million doses at 100 µg dose level."

The Justice Department said that Cardinal Health since 2013 had made payments to physician practices in advance of them buying any drugs that failed to comply with government restrictions on upfront discount arrangements.
Under the Anti-Kickback Statute, drug distributors are prohibited from offering or paying any compensation to convince doctors to purchase medications for use on patients covered by the government's Medicare health insurance program.

The Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said distributors may legally offer commercially available discounts to customers under certain circumstances.
But the department said Cardinal's payments did not meet those requirements because they were not attributable to identifiable sales of pharmaceutical products or purported rebates that the customers had not actually earned.

Investing.com —  Groupon Inc  (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares rose more than 8% on Monday after investment research firm Prescience Point Capital raised its price target on the stock to $88.17, representing a potential 225% upside.
Prescience pointed to Groupon's stake in mobile payments company SumUp, saying that Groupon's ""windfall could be greater than $1B,"" exceeding Groupon's current market value. 
""We believe the recent news of SumUp's proposed funding round, which confirms the significant value of Groupon's SumUp stake, will be the spark that sets off a series of positive catalysts that will drive Groupon shares significantly higher in short order,"" Prescience said in their report.
The research firm urged Groupon to reveal its percentage stake in SumUp, while also revealing that a significant shareholder told them Groupon's former interim CEO, Aaron Cooper, said the company's ownership share in SumUp was in the ""mid-single digits.""
""Based on the new SumUp information, we are significantly raising our estimates for Groupon's fair market value. We value Groupon's core business at 6.0x (above current levels, well below the historical average,"" said Prescience."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair expects huge pent-up demand to lead to record summer passenger numbers and higher ticket prices if the recovery is not thrown off course by a new COVID variant, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Monday. 
But he said the budget carrier's outlook remained uncertain and it was currently cutting fares aggressively to try to restore passenger numbers to pre-pandemic levels by March. The airline's shares were 3.6% lower at 1540 GMT.
O'Leary was speaking to investors after Ryanair reported a loss of 96 million euros ($107 million) for the final three months of 2021, broadly in line with a consensus estimate of a 101 million euros loss in a company poll of analysts.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, reiterated its forecast for a loss of between 250 million and 450 million euros for its full financial year ending March 31.
Ryanair has seen a ""very strong bounce back"" in bookings in recent weeks, O'Leary said, which should help passenger numbers recover rapidly from 6-7 million in January to 8-9 million in February and 11-12 million in March - reaching pre-COVID levels for that month.
Investors' focus on the ""very short term, slightly cautious commentary"" led shares to fall by as much as 6% after O'Leary's comments, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said, even as they did not include anything that undermined the view of a summer recovery. 
O'Leary said Ryanair's aircraft should be almost 90% full by April and above that level in the summer. The airline has said it is profitable when occupancy reaches 80%.
Ryanair is unlikely, however, to return this year to filling 95% of seats as it did before the pandemic, he added. 
Ryanair expects to fly 14% more capacity this summer than in the same season of 2019, and will carry a record 165 million passengers in the year to March 2023 up from just under 100 million in the current year and a pre-COVID record of 149 million. 
The Easter holidays in April are critical, O'Leary said. If they pass without a major COVID setback, ""we think we will be set fair for a very strong summer recovery,"" he said. 
While it was too soon to forecast summer fare levels, O'Leary said they should be helped by the likelihood of around 10% less short-haul capacity in Europe than in the summer of 2019 due to airline failures and cuts by rivals. 
""With the combination of less capacity short-haul and higher oil prices, I struggle to see why ... there won't be a strong pricing recovery - certainly into the peak summer months"" absent negative COVID developments, he said.

Rivals easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Wizz have both said in recent days they expect strong demand for summer holidays, but Wizz said excess capacity could weigh on pricing. Their shares were down 0.9% and 3%, respectively on Monday. 
A higher level of fuel hedging than many rivals will give Ryanair the option of being ""aggressive on pricing"" to fill planes if necessary, O'Leary said.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 11:16AM ET</span>",Canada's Wealthsimple aims for real-world cryptocurrency use as it looks beyond trading,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian online brokerage Wealthsimple wants to chart a future enabling the real-world use of cryptocurrencies rather than simply facilitating trading, but is likely to face unexpected costs and uncertain regulatory terrain along the way.
Launched in 2014 as a stock-trading platform, Wealthsimple currently has C$15 billion ($11.9 billion) in assets. It added cryptocurrency trading in August 2020 with Bitcoin and Ethereum, and has since added more coins, hosted wallets and inward transfer capabilities, and has said it intends to enable withdrawals.
Wealthsimple's first-mover advantage in crypto has helped it to break into a narrow slice of Canada's financial industry not dominated by the 'Big Six' banks. 
""We understand that part of the appeal of this asset class (is) to use the asset, not simply invest in them or speculate on them, so we're going to support that,"" Wealthsimple's Chief Legal Officer Blair Wiley said in an interview. ""We’re looking at ... how we can become more nimble, more connected to public blockchains as a key strategic priority."" 
He declined to provide a timeframe for achieving this, or the investment needed to expand the crypto capabilities of Wealthsimple, 43% owned by Power Corp of Canada.
Cryptocurrencies' uses include as alternatives to fiat currencies; for funds transfers without intermediaries or transfer fees; and the use of smart contracts, which self-execute when stated terms are met. 
Companies from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Holdings have started accepting them, but speculation and trading remains by far their most popular use.
Wealthsimple would have an edge when they eventually offer real-world use as ""they already have a captured market of people interested in trading,"" said Anne Connelly, a lecturer at Boston University focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
Canada had four other cryptocurrency companies registered with securities regulators as of Jan. 11, all focused only on the digital assets, in contrast with Wealthsimple, which is familiar to users who trade other assets. Canada has focused on regulating cryptocurrencies primarily as securities.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
The recent downtrend in cryptocurrencies highlights the benefits of reducing reliance on trading, said Katrin Tinn, assistant finance professor at McGill University, adding that Wealthsimple's familiarity and ease of use is a big draw for new cryptocurrency users over other sites.
But that could challenge the addition of more complex capabilities. 
For instance, ""if the corporation is still holding on to (users') private keys for them or preventing them from sending their cryptocurrency anywhere else, then they're selling the vision of cryptocurrency without providing the true benefits,"" Connelly said. 
Wealthsimple's plan to enable cryptocurrency withdrawals gets it closer to its goal, said Andreas Park, finance professor and co-founder of the University of Toronto's blockchain research lab LedgerHub.
But as regulations evolve, Wealthsimple will ""have to continue to devote considerable resources to build up their cryptocurrency presence and to deal with regulatory compliance,"" said Matthew Burgoyne, cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused partner at McLeod Law.
While institutions including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), as well as trading platforms including U.S.-based  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) have embraced cryptocurrencies, Canadian banks have mostly prohibited the use of credit cards for cryptocurrency purchases and avoided dealing with related businesses.
While this limits the use of cryptocurrencies, it allows Wealthsimple to gain a foothold. Clients registering for Wealthsimple's Trade product, which includes cryptocurrencies, tripled in 2021, according to company data. 

""The focus should be on what crypto/blockchain can do, not whether these tokens are good investments,"" Park said. That is a ""much better, forward-looking strategy.""

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 11:08AM ET</span>",Britain warns Russia of sanctions on oligarchs if Ukraine is invaded,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Dmitry Antonov
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Britain urged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to ""step back from the brink"" over Ukraine, warning that any incursion would trigger sanctions against companies and people with close links to the Kremlin.
The United States and Britain are trying to signal to Putin that Russia's richest men, who have huge assets abroad, will face punishment if he orders troops to invade Ukraine, though Moscow has repeatedly denied that it wants a war with its fellow former Soviet neighbour. 
The United States and its allies have prepared a list of Russian elites in or near Putin's inner circle to hit with economic sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine, a senior administration official said on Monday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat of such measures would amount to an attack on Russian businesses that would backfire because it would end up hurting British companies and Western shareholders.
""It's not often you see or hear such direct threats to attack business,"" Peskov said. ""An attack by a given country on Russian business implies retaliatory measures, and these measures will be formulated based on our interests if necessary.""
Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, London has become the pre-eminent global centre for a vast outflow of money from former Soviet republics.
Opponents of Putin have repeatedly called on the West to get tough How Western economic sanctions might target Russia on Russian money, though oligarchs and Russian officials continue to flaunt their wealth at Europe's most luxurious destinations.
Ukraine welcomed Britain's tough talk on sanctions, saying it was an important way of deterring rash decisions by Russia's elite.
""When Russian dignitaries realize that they are talking about their assets, real estate and money abroad, where they - the patriots of Russia - keep them, the hotheads in the Kremlin will cool down,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. 
Still, sanctions lists show that Europe's biggest military powers, Britain and France, continue to take a softer line on Russia's business elite than the United States.
In 2014, for example, the United States slapped sanctions on Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer. The EU and Britain have not sanctioned Sechin, one of the most powerful men in Putin's Russia. 
'STEP BACK'
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is grappling with a domestic outcry over Downing Street parties during COVID lockdowns, is due to travel to Ukraine this week and will also speak to Putin by telephone later on Monday. 
""What I will say to President Putin, as I've said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink, and I think Russia needs to step back from the brink,"" Johnson told reporters.
The United States, the European Union and Britain have said Russia may try to attack Ukraine after gathering tens of thousands of troops near the border.
Russia denies any such plan and is demanding security guarantees including a promise by NATO never to let Kyiv join the alliance. Russian officials say the West is gripped by Russophobia and has no right to lecture Moscow on how to act after NATO's intake of central and eastern European countries as members, closer to Russia, since the Cold War ended.
The United States has developed specific sanctions packages for both Russian elites who meet the criteria and their family members, and these efforts are being pursued in coordination with U.S. allies and partners, the senior U.S. official said.
""The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin's destabilizing behavior,"" said the senior administration official, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
The British government will change sanctions regulations to broaden the scope of measures it can apply to Russia to try to deter aggression towards Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Sunday.
She said London should be able to target ""any company of interest to the Kremlin and the regime in Russia"" and that ""there would be nowhere to hide for Putin's oligarchs"". Truss will outline her approach later on Monday. 
Britain has imposed sanctions on about 180 people and 48 entities since Russia annexed Crimea form Ukraine in 2014. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list

On the sanctions list are six people Britain says are close to Putin: businessmen Yuri Kovalchuk, Arkady Rotenberg and Nikolai Shamalov, former KGB officer Sergei Chemezov, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and Federal Security Service (FSB) chief Alexander Bortnikov.
The sanctions allow Britain to freeze individual assets and ban individual from entering the United Kingdom.

The total value of Debswana's diamond exports stood at $3.466 billion in 2021 compared with $2.120 billion in 2020, the central bank data showed.
Debswana, a joint venture between  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) unit De Beers and Botswana's government, sells 75% of its output to De Beers with the balance taken up by the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company.
Debswana sales fell by 30% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic hit demand while global travel restrictions impacted trading. Since mid-2020 De Beers has shifted some of its rough diamond viewings to international diamond centres such as Antwerp to cater for customers unable to travel to Gaborone.
""Demand for rough diamonds remained robust, with positive midstream sentiment and strong demand for diamond jewellery continuing over the holiday period, particularly in the key U.S. consumer market,"" Anglo American said in a production update last Thursday.
Debswana accounts for almost all Botswana's diamond exports, with Lucara Diamond Corp's Karowe mine being the only other operating diamond mine in the country. 
Botswana gets about 30% of its revenues and 70% of its foreign exchange earnings from diamonds. The southern African country expects its economy to have grown by 9.7% in 2021, after an 8.5% contraction in 2020.

Debswana's production increased by 35% to 22.326 million carats in 2021 from 16.559 million carats in 2020, mostly due to higher-grade ore being treated at its flagship Jwaneng mine, Anglo American said.
Russia's Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds and a competitor of De Beers, reported revenue jumped by 49% to $4.2 billion last year as demand exceeded supply.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) surged 11% Monday after it said it won a contract from the Israel government for its proposed Covid-19 vaccine.
Under the advance purchase agreement, Novavax will provide an initial 5 million doses of its protein-based vaccine with an option for Israel to purchase an additional 5 million. The company will work with the Ministry of Health to obtain the necessary authorizations and finalize plans for distribution in the country pending regulatory approval.
Israel was among the first few countries to have approved a booster following two shots of the vaccine. The country is also offering anyone over 60 a chance to get a fourth shot.
The contract marks a big win for Novavax which is late to the market with its Covid vaccine because of manufacturing issues, all of which it resolved. The vaccine has approvals from the E.U., the WHO, and in several countries. It expects to submit its application for emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in some time.
India’s Serum Institute is the contracted party to make the vaccines. Serum is also making AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 shots.
The protein-based vaccine by Novavax has shown to be more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning coronavirus variants. The company plans to begin commercial manufacturing of a vaccine tailored to the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant this month, according to a previous report by Reuters.

Outlining the reasons for the upgrade, Levy said they ""expect both further volume growth and sustained margin strength."" In addition, Credit Suisse also expects ""positive EPS revisions in the coming years - we are on average ~25% above consensus on 2022-24 EPS.”
“Tesla remains the leader of the multi-decade secular transition to EVs. With less question around demand and much more question around supply of EVs, Tesla should be a key beneficiary - it has a product lead vs. others, and has taken the most holistic approach on EV supply,” the analyst explained.
“We believe legacy OEMs are taking clear steps to transitioning to an EV world, yet we expect Tesla to maintain a lead for the foreseeable future."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Education group Pearson has agreed to buy the certification company Credly to expand its offering to businesses looking to train and retain workers at a time of tight labour markets and rapid technological innovation.
The global learning company said on Monday it had agreed to buy Credly in a deal that valued it at $200 million, in its latest move to respond to the demand for workforce training in areas like IT. Pearson already owned 20%.
The UK-listed firm, a major supplier of courseware and assessments in schools and colleges in the United States, Britain and around the world, will have around 1,000 enterprise clients when it adds Credly to its Workforce Skills division. 
Pearson CEO Andy Bird told Reuters that verified credentials were becoming more important as technology adapts, leaving many companies with a skills gap where staff need training on how to work with processes such as artificial intelligence.
""Showing the world in this new form of digital resumes .. what credentials you have can make you ultimately either a better employee or more employable,"" he said. 
Pearson, which has been buffeted by the shift from physical courseware to online learning, bought AI and analytics group Faethm in 2021, which spots skills gaps for organisations. 
Credly partners with organisations such as  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services to provide certifications, or digital credentials, to workers both inside their firms and out who have attained a certain level with their product. Based in the United States, half of the people earning credentials on the platform are outside America, with India one of its biggest markets. 
Pearson will now be able to combine the diagnostic tools of Faethm with its own digital learning programmes and Credly's certification capabilities to offer a full service to companies. 

Jonathan Finkelstein, founder and CEO of Credly, said the demand for training and certification had been growing for several years but it had been accelerated by the pandemic, with the process now helping to retain and attract workers. 
More than 2,000 organisations use the platform and it has issued more than 50 million credentials to 25 million people. Its 2021 revenue rose 47% to $13.3 million. The deal will be funded by cash and available liquidity.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, with lingering fears about interest rate hikes and negative pandemic-related newsflow both weighing on sentiment. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 135 points, or 0.4%, at 34,590 points, but the S&P 500 was down less than 0.1% and the NASDAQ Composite, after a rough month, was up 0.9% on bargain-hunting in names seen as oversold.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts David Mericle and Jan Hatzius said in a note on Friday that they now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates five times this year, a view that is fast becoming consensus. That's due not least to the risk that the supply side disruptions that have squeezed prices higher for the last year may yet hang around for longer. A report by Danish scientists suggests that a new subvariant of the Omicron-version of Covid-19 has started to spread, and is at least 1.5 times as infectious as the original Omicron variant. That was in turn more infectious than Delta, the previously dominant variant. 
New infection numbers have been falling across the U.S. for the last two weeks, but the emergence of a new and more infectious strain could prolong the wave of absenteeism seen during January.
On a relatively quiet morning for corporate news, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock stood out with a gain of 7.5% after analysts at Citi upgraded it, saying it had oversold in the wake of its disappointing fourth-quarter numbers and first-quarter guidance last week. The stock had fallen to its lowest since March 2020 after warning of a sharp slowdown in subscriber acquisition and higher costs for new content.
The importance of constant new content releases was underlined earlier in a Wall Street Journal analysis showing that nearly half of the subscribers who joined HBO, Disney+ and Peacock ahead of specific content releases had let their memberships lapse within six months. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, which is exposed to trends in both streaming and Covid-19, rose 1.2%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, another to have sold off heavily last week after postponing new product launches until at least 2023, also attracted dip-buyers, rising 5.5% to $893. At that level, the stock still trades at over 12 times expected sales this year, and an eye-watering 173 times trailing earnings. 
Another stock rebounding sharply was Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), which rose 9.7% after the audio streaming company said it would attach health warnings to podcasts that challenged broadly-accepted science on issues such as the pandemic. In related developments, comedian Joe Rogan apologised for platforming speakers who had cast doubt on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, leading to a boycott of Spotify by a handful of prominent artists.
Elsewhere, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) stock fell 3.0% after reports indicating that the buyout price for the company offered by Elliott Management and Vista will be below previous expectations. Otis (NYSE:OTIS) stock rose 1.6%, shrugging off a warning about weak sales growth this year due to the ongoing real estate crisis in China that is weighing on orders for elevators."
1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 09:25AM ET</span>",Analysts eye UPS automation efforts to offset increased wage costs,"By Arriana McLymore
NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - Higher labor costs during the pandemic-plagued holiday season may erode the profits of  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), the world's biggest package delivery firm, which is set to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday. 
Investors will be watching for the margin impact from the company's mostly unionized delivery workforce. UPS hired nearly 100,000 people for the holiday season and plans to keep a portion of those workers on board. 
The company increased worker pay in certain regions to an average of $18 per hour from $15, it said in June. 
Union pay and benefits for UPS drivers, sort center workers and package loaders generally exceed those at non-union shops like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), UPS's largest customer and a growing delivery rival. 
Analysts estimate an 8.7% year-over-year revenue increase to $27.1 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting higher delivery volumes and surcharges as a surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant pushed more customers to online holiday shopping. They expect earnings per share of $3.10, up %16.5 from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. 
From FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to DHL to the United States Postal Service, delivery companies ""are having to cough up money"" to hire and keep workers, said Cathy Morrow Roberson, president of consultancy Logistics Trends & Insights. 
""UPS has had to raise pay in certain areas of the country to attract some workers, but not on the same level as perhaps FedEx or a post office,"" she said.
When turnover and a lack of workers in the Ground unit at rival FedEx last year resulted in delivery delays, inefficient work flows and hundreds of millions of dollars in extra costs, UPS executives said they weren't feeling such severe strain. 
UPS has had more predictable labor costs tied to the stability of its unionized workforce. FedEx uses less well-compensated contractors in its Ground operations that handle many e-commerce deliveries. 
COVID-19 union protections have also helped UPS attract more workers compared to its competitors, Roberson said. 
Still, investors are keen to hear more about how the company will use automation to boost efficiency and reduce costs. 
UPS has invested in more automation tools since 2020 to increase efficiencies in its fulfillment process. The 114-year-old carrier beat FedEx and USPS with nearly 97% of on-time deliveries during the holiday season, helped by ample staffing, mild weather and a longer shopping season that spread ""peak"" holiday deliveries over more days, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a report. 

Now, analysts are eyeing how these technologies, wage hikes and price increases are impacting profit margins.
""I think we will see leadership put more of a focus on automation capabilities within sorting facilities,"" said Donnelly, senior analyst at Third Bridge Group. ""That will, over time, insulate them more and more from near-term labor dynamics.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. public charging network for electric vehicles is becoming more robust, but significant differences in reliability and performance remain between providers, an industry ranking by engineering consulting firm umlaut found.
The group tested chargers by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Electrify America, ChargePoint, EVgo, Blink Charging, EVconnect, Greenlots and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Superchargers across seven U.S. states in September.
Electrify America reached the highest score in the ranking, followed by Tesla's Supercharger and ChargePoint, said umlaut, which was acquired by Accenture (NYSE:ACN) in October. 
(Graphic: U.S. EV charging network performance: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRICCARS/CHARGING/gdpzynqagvw/chart.png)
The ranking considered the technical performance of chargers, as well as the charging station environment, such as lighting, roofing and nearby amenities. It also took into account the performance of charging networks' apps, which car owners use to look for nearby chargers and make payments.
""Across all categories we see the system becoming more mature and stable"", said Hakan Ekman, one of the study's authors. umlaut conducted a similar ranking in 2020 in California.
The group used a Tesla Model 3 and a Ford Mach-E for its 2021 tests, but did not consider the vehicles' performance in their rankings.

The build-out of public charging stations is seen as crucial to support a growing fleet of EVs on U.S. roads. While 80% of current U.S. EV owners charge their car at home, a robust charging network is considered a prerequisite to making consumers comfortable with EVs and increasing their share.
Last year, EVs accounted for around 2% of all new car sales, a share carmakers vow to increase to at least 40% by 2030.

Investing.com – Otis stock (NYSE:OTIS) slipped 5.6% in Monday’s premarket trading after  the company gave disappointing guidance for the coming year, overshadowed by weakness in the key Chinese real estate market.
The elevator manufacturer said organic sales will grow only 2.5%-4.5% this year, thanks to the slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, where an ongoing debt crisis is holding back fresh investment by developers of high-rise office and residential space. 
Business from China comprised a fifth of its 2021 net sales. Otis said it is taking steps to contain any fallout due to its exposure to troubled developers, including requiring them to make cash pre-payments. It said around 10 customers had breached “2 or 3 red lines” which would amount to less than 0.5% of its total sales.
Net sales for the year are seen at $14.55 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up only 2%. They grew 12% in the year through December. Profit per share for the year is expected to be a tad higher at $3.25 center of its guidance range compared to $3.01 in 2021.
Otis' fourth-quarter sales already slowed to a mere 2% rise to $1.6 billion, while organic sales rose only 1.2%. The company attributed this to tougher comparisons in the Americas, and the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, as business recovered from the impact of Covid-19 in the same period a year ago.
Fourth-quarter new equipment orders were up 7.3% while order backlogs rose 1%.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 08:33AM ET</span>",Explainer-How does Merck's COVID-19 pill compare to Pfizer's?,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Rival antiviral pills from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co that demonstrated efficacy in trials of adults with COVID-19 who are at high risk of serious illness are now both in use. The drugs are being studied to see if they can prevent infection in people exposed to the virus.
Here is an explanation of the differences in the two pills.
Which of the new pills works better? 
Trial data provided by the two companies suggest that Pfizer has the more effective pill.
Pfizer in December said final trial results showed that its treatment reduced the chance of hospitalization or death by 89% in COVID-19 patients at risk of severe illness given the treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms, and by 88% when given within five days of onset.
Merck in November said its full trial results showed that molnupiravir lowered the chance of hospitalization or death by about 30% in patients at risk of severe COVID who were given the treatment within five days of developing symptoms.
An earlier, interim look at Merck's trial on Oct. 1 had suggested that molnupiravir halved the risk of hospitalization or death. Merck did not provide figures regarding patients getting the pill within three days of onset. 
Pfizer's two-drug regimen is being sold under the brand name Paxlovid. Merck's drug has the brand name Lagevrio.
Why are these drugs important?
While a number of vaccines are available worldwide to help prevent infection and serious illness, including one made by Pfizer, there are limited treatment options for people infected with COVID-19. 
Currently, COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized but are at risk of serious illness can be treated with antibody drugs, though they have to be given intravenously at hospitals or infusion centers.
Antibodies developed early in the pandemic have not held up against the now dominant Omicron coronavirus variant. Sotrovimab, from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), which in trials reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 85%, has shown to be effective against the highly-transmissable variant. 
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s intravenous antiviral drug remdesivir, sold as Veklury, was recently given emergency approval by U.S. regulators as a three-day infusion for at-risk COVID patients after it was shown to reduce their risk of hospitalization by 87%.
How do they work? 
Both oral regimens are given for five days. Pfizer's regimen is three pills in the morning and three pills at night. Merck's drug is taken as four pills in the morning and four at night.
Pfizer's drug is part of a class known as protease inhibitors designed to block an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to multiply. It is given in combination with ritonavir, an older antiviral that boosts the activity of protease inhibitors but can cause gastrointestinal side effects and interfere with certain other medications.
Merck's pill, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is a nucleoside analogue with a mechanism of action that aims to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. 
Both companies have said laboratory studies show that their pills are active against coronavirus infections caused by the Omicron variant.
What do we know about safety?
Both companies have released only limited data on the treatments, but expressed confidence in their safety.
Pfizer said about 20% of patients who received either the pill or a placebo in trials experienced adverse events, mostly mild. Serious side effects were reported by 1.7% of patients receiving the drug and 6.6% of placebo patients.
Since the ritonavir component of Paxlovid can interfere with other medications, physicians emphasize that patients need to share an accurate list of any other drugs they are taking before being prescribed the Pfizer drug.
Merck said 12% of patients receiving its drug and 11% of placebo patients experienced drug-related adverse events.
Drugs in the same class as Merck's pill have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck has said similar studies of molnupiravir - for longer and at higher doses than used in humans - show that it does not cause birth defects or cancer.
Molnupiravir is not authorized for U.S. patients younger than 18 years of age because it could affect bone and cartilage growth. It is also not recommended for use during pregnancy.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises that both men and women of child-bearing age be on reliable birth control while taking the Merck drug, and that it cannot be used by pregnant women. 
What do we know about supplies?
Pfizer and Merck have said they are making efforts to expand global access to the drugs, including allowing generic drugmakers to sell lower-cost versions in low-income countries. 
Pfizer has said it expects to have capacity to produce up to 120 million courses of its therapy this year.
Merck has said it could produce at least 20 million courses of its drug this year.
Which costs more?

The U.S. government provides vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 for free to U.S. residents. Countries around the world are negotiating prices with Pfizer and Merck.
The United States is paying around $530 for each course of Paxlovid and $700 for each course of molnupiravir.

Ryanair has repeatedly said it considers Ukraine as potentially a major growth market and O'Leary said that while the airline was monitoring tensions with Russia it had not changed its plans to boost capacity there.
""We remain committed to Ukraine. As long as Ukraine is looking westward there are huge ... flows of people travelling to and from Ukraine working in central and eastern Europe,"" he said. 
""If it is not invaded by Russia, it is a country where we would expect to open a couple of bases .. some time in the next two or three years subject to agreements on costs,"" he said.
Ryanair's new routes team made their third or fourth visit to Ukraine in January, he said, but Ukrainian authorities were not in a position to discuss new routes and bases ""as they were somewhat otherwise distracted.""
""We hope the situation in Ukraine gets resolved diplomatically. And if it is, it remains a very exciting growth opportunity for us,"" he said. 
If the offers are good enough, Ryanair could deploy 15-20 aircraft across up to five airport bases over the next two or three years, O'Leary said. 

Ryanair is relatively agnostic about where it bases its planes so long as it gets the best prices, he added. 
""Our growth will always be opportunistic. It's not some Napoleonic invasion of Russia here. Whoever comes up with the best deals will get the next four or five aircraft.""

BlackBerry said the transaction with the vehicle, Catapult IP Innovations Inc, will not impact customers' use of its products or services.
The move comes weeks after BlackBerry pulled the plug on service for its once ubiquitous business smartphones, which were toted by executives, politicians and legions of fans in the early 2000s.
U.S-listed shares of BlackBerry were down 3.6% in premarket trading. One of the so-called ""meme stocks"", such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), that witnessed a surge in early 2021, BlackBerry rose 41% last year.

At the closing of the deal, the company will receive $450 million in cash and a promissory note for $150 million. 
Once known for its phones with a tiny QWERTY physical keyboard and the BBM instant messaging service, BlackBerry's core businesses today are cybersecurity and software used by automakers.

Investing.com – Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) traded 2.5% higher in premarket Monday after Citi upgraded the stock to a ‘buy’ with a target of $450, 17% higher than its Friday close of $384.36.
According to reports, analyst Jason B Bazine cited attractive valuation for his optimism on the stock. Netflix shares have lost almost a quarter of their value since the company’s January 20 guidance that disappointed traders and other stakeholders.
The company is projecting it will add 2.5 million users by March, substantially lower than the 4 million it added in the first quarter of 2021. It closed December at nearly 222 million users.  
Netflix faces increasing headwinds after nearly two years of scorching growth fueled by the pandemic. Competition in the form of Disney+ and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) is increasing while competition for content is also driving costs higher. 
Bazine said cash flow remains high at Netflix and “the prevailing equity value offers a compelling entry point”. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter doubled from a year ago to $569 million.
In other news, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings last week bought 51,440 shares of the company for around $20 million. Hastings now owns about 5.16 million shares through a Trust following the purchase. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital has bought over 3.1 million Netflix shares.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 07:46AM ET</span>","Merck's COVID pill is last choice for U.S. patients, global use varies","By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Merck & Co's new antiviral pill, once touted as a potential game changer for treating COVID-19, is the last choice among four available options for at-risk patients given its relatively low efficacy and potential safety issues, U.S. doctors, healthcare systems and pharmacies told Reuters. 
A rival oral treatment from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Paxlovid, is in high demand, followed by an intravenous antibody therapy made by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR). 
With supplies of those products tight, doctors facing a surge of cases caused by the Omicron variant are also turning to  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s remdesivir, an antiviral that needs to be given as three daily infusions to help high-risk COVID patients avoid hospitalization.
When Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced initial data late last year showing their drug, molnupiravir, halved the risk of hospitalization, it was hailed as a potential breakthrough, the first COVID treatment that could be taken at home.
Enthusiasm for the drug waned some when full data showed about 30% efficacy. That was further eroded when Paxlovid was shown to cut hospitalization risk by 90%. GSK's sotrovimab and Gilead's remdesivir - sold as Veklury - cut hospitalization risk by 85% and 87%, respectively.
So far, 265,000 courses of Paxlovid and 1.1 million courses of molnupiravir have been distributed, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) data show. That early data also shows hundreds of thousands of courses of Merck's drug sitting on the shelves of pharmacies and hospitals around the country.
""The Merck product is only 30% effective so we're not dispensing it,"" said Jim Mangia, president of St. John’s Well Child and Family Center, a network of public health centers in South and Central Los Angeles.
He said the center has stockpiled 200 molnupiravir courses received from the federal government, and is requesting new deliveries only of Paxlovid, which it has been prescribing.
Reuters talked to over a dozen healthcare providers in more than half a dozen countries, most of whom said they are prescribing molnupiravir on a limited basis and primarily if more effective options cannot be used or are not available.
Asked about molnupiravir's last-choice status among U.S. doctors, Merck said demand will strengthen as more real-world and clinical trial data emerges.
""There is a lot of education that will need to be done over the next few weeks and months to get people up to speed,"" said Eliav Barr, head of global medical affairs at Merck.
The Merck and Pfizer regimens - both taken for five days early after onset of symptoms - were heralded as an important advance, allowing at-home treatment instead of cumbersome intravenous therapies given in infusion centers or hospitals.
Dozens of generic drugmakers are lined up to produce Merck's drug for low-income countries, but future demand is unclear. 
    Sales of molnupiravir, under the brand name Lagevrio, are expected to top $5 billion this year, while Pfizer's Paxlovid is expected to rake in nearly $23 billion, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
'CAN'T GIVE MOLNUPIRAVIR AWAY'
    The U.S. government, which has spent around $2.2 billion on molnupiravir and $5.3 billion on Paxlovid, has offered about 85% of the supplies to states and sent the remaining 15% directly to community-based health centers.
    ""I can't give molnupiravir away,"" said Steve Moore, pharmacist and owner of Condo Pharmacy in Plattsburgh, N.Y.
""Paxlovid flies off the shelves even with drug interactions,"" he said, referring to Paxlovid's potential to interfere with the body's ability to clear certain other medications.
Of the 80 courses of molnupiravir he received, 70 remain in stock, Moore said, while all 40 courses of Paxlovid quickly sold out. He has a waiting list for his next shipment.
The two oral treatments work differently.
Molnupiravir introduces errors into the genetic code of the coronavirus and both men and women taking it are instructed to use effective birth control due to potential safety issues. Paxlovid - a two-drug regimen that includes the older antiviral ritonavir which boosts effectiveness but can affect other medicines a patient is taking - blocks production of an enzyme called protease that the virus needs to reproduce.
Outside the United States, governments are managing molnupiravir's use closely. 
    In the UK, high-risk patients can volunteer for a clinical trial to receive the Merck medication but it has not rolled out broadly. France is not using it at all, having rescinded its order for the pills.
    In Italy, each region has its own rules but often a general practitioner must first refer patients to COVID health groups that can prescribe molnupiravir. 
In some low-income countries, generic versions of molnupiravir are available at affordable prices.
In Bangladesh, molnupiravir is far cheaper than its rivals and is being widely used for the general population while generic Paxlovid is being prescribed by large corporate hospitals that have bought it for their patients, according to Dr. Sayedur Rahman, chairman, Department of Pharmacology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.
    In India, the national health agency does not recommend molnupiravir. The drug is available in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, but its use has been narrowed to unvaccinated people with severe health problems, according to Dr. Ambrish Mithal, chairman, endocrinology and diabetes, Max HealthCare hospital in New Delhi.
    In the Philippines, versions of molnupiravir are widely prescribed through hospital pharmacies. Doctors said they have seen patients improve on it within two to three days.
RANKING THE OPTIONS
The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends Paxlovid as the top choice for at-risk patients. GSK's sotrovimab is ranked second, followed by remdesivir, which has been used since early in the pandemic for hospitalized patients and recently received emergency authorization to help high-risk COVID patients stave off severe illness.
Drugs in the same class as Merck's pill, known as nucleoside analogues, have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck has said animal studies of its drug - for longer and at higher doses than used in humans - show that it does not cause birth defects or cancer.
    Infectious disease specialist Dr. Rajesh Gandhi said his hospital, Boston's Massachusetts General, is just beginning to use the new oral antivirals. He expects to prescribe Paxlovid for most patients who are eligible.
""As far as molnupiravir, I would use it in a person who is at high risk for severe COVID but only if other options – like Paxlovid, sotrovimab or remdesivir – are not available or cannot be given,"" he said.
Dr. Tara Vijayan, infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health, said Los Angeles County authorities have prioritized underserved communities for the pills, limiting the hospital’s access.
Last weekend, the over 400,000-member health system temporarily ran out of sotrovimab and started scaling up to use remdesivir for outpatients.
""We found one pharmacy in all of L.A. County that had Paxlovid. The rest had molnupiravir, which for us we consider not as effective,"" she said.

Northwell Health, New York State's largest healthcare provider, is waiting for supplies of molnupiravir and Paxlovid, Chief Pharmacy Officer Onisis Stefas told Reuters.
For high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID, he said Northwell recommends that physicians hew to NIH’s recommendations. “On the very bottom is the molnupiravir.""

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>","Analysis-Inflation fears, Biden antitrust efforts could doom Sanderson, Wayne chicken deal","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A plan hatched by Cargill Inc and Continental Grain Co to combine two big chicken processors -  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) and Wayne Farms - flies in the face of the Biden administration's efforts to fight not just consolidation in the sector, but inflation.
The deal is being considered even as the U.S. Labor Department said in early January that inflation was at a nearly 40-year high. Chicken prices rose 10.4% in the previous year.
President Joe Biden's administration, concerned about price hikes in general and especially in the meat sector, announced earlier this month that it would spend $1 billion and issue new rules as a way to address a lack of ""meaningful competition"" in meat processing.
The Justice Department, if it decides to fight the deal in court, will be able to argue that there has already been price-fixing in the sector.
Still, the market shares of the two companies are not as big as is often seen in merger challenges, experts said. Wayne and Sanderson combined would have a market share of 13.5%, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Commodities trader Cargill and agricultural investor Continental Grain said in August they planned to buy Sanderson Farms Inc - the third largest U.S. chicken producer - for $4.53 billion. In a sign regulators are taking a serious look at the deal, the companies got a second request for more information in December.
Meanwhile there has been concern about the deal from both sides of the political aisle. Senators Chuck Grassley, a Republican, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, both urged the Justice Department to take a hard look at the proposed transaction because it might raise prices.
The Minnesota attorney general's office also has reached out to other states to aid in the federal investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Minnesota state attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
The plan is to merge Sanderson Farms with smaller rival Wayne Farms, owned by Continental Grain.
    Tyson Foods Inc leads the U.S. chicken market at 21%, Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp is second at 17% and Sanderson third at 10%. Perdue and Koch Foods are fourth and fifth at 7% and 6%, respectively, according to a Tyson investor fact book from the 2019 fiscal year published in 2020.
Another argument against trying to scuttle the deal is that the two companies serve different sectors of the chicken market with Sanderson focused on retail and Wayne on supplying restaurants.
But Pilgrim's Pride pleaded guilty in February 2021 to conspiring to fix chicken prices and pass on the costs to consumers and other purchasers. Tyson said in June 2020 that it had self-reported price-fixing to the Justice Department.
Antitrust experts agreed the price-fixing - even if Sanderson and Wayne were not involved - would be cited as evidence of a concentrated market.
""That's a factor that weighs against the merger even if you don't have high market shares, said William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission.

Scott Gant, a partner with the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who represents food distributors U.S. Foods and Sysco (NYSE:SYY), in a 2018 lawsuit alleging chicken price fixing against Sanderson and others, said tough talk from the White House along with rising prices and price fixing allegations does not bode well for approval of the proposed transaction.
""It has an uphill battle,"" he said.

HONG KONG/DANZHOU, China (Reuters) - The opening last year of the world's largest artificial resort island, developed by China Evergrande Group for nearly $13 billion, was the realisation of the ambitions of founder Hui Ka Yan, who sketched a design for the project himself.
Now Evergrande is in default to global bondholders, the former Communist Party secretary of the small Hainan island city where Ocean Flower Island was built is serving a life sentence for bribery, and officials in Danzhou city have ordered 39 of the project's towers - roughly 3,900 of the island's 65,000 homes - to be demolished over environmental and construction violations. 
The demolition of part of the 2,000-acre, flower-shaped project would add to the woes of what was once China's top-selling developer, which is now reeling under more than $300 billion in debt, struggling to revive sales and repay creditors and suppliers.
Government documents related to the project and details provided by two sources with direct knowledge of the island's development show how the work skirted environmental and zoning regulations during nearly a decade of development, eventually drawing scrutiny from regulatory authorities.
The two sources, who were close to the project and Hui's thinking, declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Reuters couldn't determine when or whether the demolition would be carried out. Evergrande did not respond to Reuters requests for comment or to queries for Hui.
Hainan province officials and local authorities in Danzhou, which has direct oversight of the project, did not respond to requests for comment.
The saga is a cautionary tale for China's property giants as the country under Xi Jinping undertakes a sweeping regulatory crackdown that is reining in the most free-wheeling segments of the private sector economy. 
""What is happening in Hainan suggests local governments are tightening their grip on irregularities of property developers,"" said Li Gen, CEO of Beijing BG Capital Management Ltd, a firm specialising in credit investment.
During a Reuters visit in January, workers had blocked off the 39 buildings with blue metal sheets. As of Monday, Ocean Flower's 39 under-construction residential buildings were still standing. Evergrande has said the rest of the project would be unaffected.
The local government issued the demolition order in December, citing illegal construction and environmental violations, according to local media.
GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY
Situated in what had been a largely rural corner of China's southernmost Hainan province and, the sources say, inspired by Dubai's famous palm-shaped artificial islands, Ocean Flower Island consists of theme parks, five-star hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants, shopping malls, museums and spas, and residential towers.
During the early days of its construction, workers sent Hui, 63, weekly drone footage to review progress, one of the sources said. 
In 2017, Hui was Asia's richest man. As recently as July 2021, the former steel technician could be found mingling with power brokers in Beijing at a celebration to mark the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Chinese authorities have been scrutinising the firm and Hui's assets since late last year to determine whether anything was hidden, and the central bank has blamed mismanagement and breakneck expansion for Evergrande's problems.
As Evergrande, now at the centre of China's property sector liquidity squeeze, pushed ahead with the resort island, it ran into environmental issues, in particular over land reclamation that damaged the local ecology, the two sources said.
DREAM PROJECT
Evergrande had been hit with environmental penalties from the Danzhou city government since as early as 2017 over reclaiming land from the sea in areas where it is not allowed, according to a Dec. 23, 2020, document posted on the city's website. 
The Danzhou government document also said that Evergrande built the 39 residential buildings using a tourism infrastructure plan, which could not be used for residential development without government approval. 
Evergrande was asked by the Danzhou authorities to ""improve"" the plan, with no specific requirements cited, according to the document. In 2021, the Hainan provincial government said the company had made a plan to transform the 39 buildings into hotels, office buildings and dormitories for employees.
Reuters could not establish whether that plan was approved by any regulator before December's demolition order by the Danzhou authorities.
The Danzhou government document from 2020 said local authorities allowed construction to continue despite environmental violations without elaborating on the reasons.
A Hainan provincial government document issued in early 2019 and posted on the government's website showed Danzhou had levied $34 million worth of fines against the project. These fines were paid, the document shows. Reuters could not determine whether additional fines had been imposed.
Although Evergrande has never commented publicly on the fines, the developer said in a Jan. 3 WeChat post from the official Ocean Flower Island account responding to the demolition order that it had been ""firmly and actively"" rectifying the environmental issues since 2017. 
The 2019 Hainan provincial government document also said the city of Danzhou illegally divided land parcels to make them easier to pass land reclamation review, approving 36 related projects in two working days for Ocean Flower Island. 
Danzhou city government did not respond to requests for comment.
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
As Evergrande's worsening financial troubles came into public view in 2020, the Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment began to take a closer look at Ocean Flower Island, provincial and central government documents show. 
China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond Reuters requests for comment. CCDI could not be reached for comment through the number listed on its website. There is no listed email address for the agency.
The former party secretary for Danzhou, Zhang Qi, was sentenced in late 2020 to life in prison for taking bribes from unidentified business owners and helping them illegally acquire environmentally protected land, according to an article the CCDI published in early 2021.
The CCDI article identified Ocean Flower Island as an example of a project Zhang facilitated illegally to ""gain political capital"", saying he ""used islands to get rich"", but did not say whether he accepted bribes in relation to it.
Zhang pleaded guilty to the corruption charges and surrendered all bribes to authorities, state news agency Xinhua reported in late 2020.

Chinese courts do not typically release judgment papers on corrupt officials to the public, and his lawyer was not identified. Zhang could not be reached for comment.
The CCDI also found that the construction of Ocean Flower had caused permanent large-scale damage to coral reefs and white lip shells.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in a cautious fashion Monday at the start of a week that includes the key monthly jobs report and earnings from the likes of tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 175 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 45 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices on Wall Street have sold off heavily in January as the potential for as many as six Federal Reserve rate hikes this year prompted investors to take some money off the table. 
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 4.4% this month, heading for its worst month since March 2020, while the broad-based S&P 500 is down 7%, its biggest monthly selloff since March 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stands in correction territory, down 12% in January and is on track for its worst month since October 2008.
More selling looks likely, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson. Last week’s wild swings were “classic bear market action.” he wrote in a note Monday, and “we remain sellers of rallies and of the view that S&P 500 fair value remains closer to 4,000 tactically,” The index closed Friday at 4431.85.
The earnings season continues this week, with reports from tech heavyweights Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, as well as the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).
Ahead of this, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is likely to be in the spotlight Monday following a report in The Wall Street Journal stating Elliott Management’s private-equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, and tech-focused Vista Equity Partners are set to take the software company private.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) will also be in focus following accusations that it was being used as a platform to promote false information about Covid-19 vaccines, specifically via comedian Joe Rogan's podcasts. 
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, with most focus centering on the January nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday. Economists are forecasting that the economy added 155,000 jobs, slowing from 199,000 in December as the Omicron variant hit.
Oil prices traded higher, remaining near seven-year peaks, as tensions remain fraught surrounding Russia and its plans for Ukraine.
Traders are also looking ahead to Wednesday’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to discuss future output.
U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded 0.4% higher at $87.17 a barrel, while the Brent Oil Futures contract rose 0.5% to $88.92. The benchmarks recorded their highest levels since October 2014 on Friday, and their sixth straight weekly gain.

Investing.com – Spotify stock (NYSE:SPOT) traded 1.8% higher in premarket Monday as it attempted to calm the backlsh over comedian Joe Rogan's podcasts.
The company said it will begin to tag Covid-related content with an advisory, prompting users to check out the service’s new “hub for data-driven facts and up-to-date information” from the health and scientific communities.
The streaming platform made public its content policy Sunday, without making changes to it. The action follows accusation that Rogan and the platform promoted false information about Covid-19 vaccines.  
Last week, Spotify had to drop singer Neil Young’s music after he called upon the company to choose between him and Rogan, alleging it is spreading fake information about Covid-19 vaccines through Rogan’s show. Musician Joni Mitchell and rocker Nils Lofgren followed suit in seeking to remove their music in support of Young.
Earlier this month, a group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter accusing the podcast of promoting “baseless conspiracy theories” and asked the service to take action against mass-misinformation on its platform.
“We know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users,” said Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in a blog post Sunday.
The company has removed over 20,000 Covid-19-related podcast episodes since the start of the pandemic, a Spotify spokesman told The Wall Street Journal last week.
“If I pissed you off, I’m sorry,” Rogan posted on his Instagram account Sunday, referring to the furore.

The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) indicted the bank in December 2020 after an investigation into the activities of a Bulgarian crime ring involving top-level wrestlers accused of laundering profits from cocaine trafficking.
""The OAG has stated that it is seeking compensation of around 34.8 million Swiss francs as well as additional compensation of around 7.6 million francs from Credit Suisse AG,"" an FCC spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Credit Suisse said it ""unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent"". The bank told Reuters that it would defend itself vigorously in court.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank, which is trying to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals and the abrupt departure of its chairman, issued a profit warning last week due to legal costs and a slowdown in its trading and wealth management divisions.
A summary on the FCC's website shows Credit Suisse is accused of failing to take all necessary measures to prevent an employee from laundering money.
The employee, a former Credit Suisse manager who was also indicted, is charged with having processed transactions worth several million Swiss francs between 2004 and 2008 despite indications the money could be of criminal origin. 

Credit Suisse denied any wrongdoing by the employee.

The tech-heavy index was down 12% in January as of Friday’s close, worse than the 10% drop in 2008 when the global financial crisis rocked markets worldwide. The selloff comes on the back of a surge in U.S. Treasury yields, hurting pricier tech stocks that are valued on future growth expectations.
Futures tracking the elite Nasdaq 100 Index -- an indication of what’s to come at open on the last day of the month -- showed a 0.7% rise, extending their rebound from Friday as earnings beats helped somewhat lessen the Fed blow. But even if the Composite index rises by 1%, it would still be on track for the grim milestone.
And strategists say it might be too soon to say the worst is over. For Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, the volatility and intraday swings resemble “classic bear market action.” Indeed, gyrations in futures contracts were a common sight last week with four-plus percentage point moves on average as nervous growth-stock investors hunted for the bottom after one of the most brutal selloffs since March 2020.
What’s more, Bank of America Corp. highlighted on Friday that 2,648 out of 3,682 Nasdaq stocks were now in a bear market and nearly half of them were down more than 50% from their 52-week highs.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 05:10AM ET</span>",Facebook owner Meta to lift veil off its metaverse business,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Since October, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has renamed the company, articulated a vision of the internet where people can digitally connect through virtual-reality avatars or teleport to see places like ancient Rome, and helped trigger the metaverse investment craze.
When the company, now Meta Platforms Inc, reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, investors will get a new window into the financial impact of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's current passion.
Meta plans to break out the results of its augmented and virtual-reality hardware unit, Reality Labs, for the first time, an investment the company previously warned would cause a $10 billion hit to 2021 profit and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future."" 
The company is hiring engineers and buying up multiple virtual reality gaming studios to build toward the metaverse, which is a broad futuristic idea of shared virtual realms that can be accessed via different devices and which Zuckerberg is betting will be the successor to the mobile internet. 
Analysts said they would be keen to see indicators about the Reality Labs division's profitability, how long it might be a drag on the advertising side, and evidence around the strength of VR headset sales. 
""It's going to be huge for me as an analyst, not having to surgically dig through Facebook earnings ... and just see a lens into the Reality Labs,"" said VR market analyst Stephanie Llamas of VoxPop.
Meta has said it expects non-advertising revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as it compares unfavorably with the ""strong launch"" of its VR Quest 2 headsets during the previous year's holiday shopping season.
The company has not released sales numbers for Quest headsets, but a July recall notice for the Quest 2's facial foam liners said it affected about 4 million units in the United States. In a sign of strong sales for the headsets during the recent holiday period, its Oculus app hit the top spot on the U.S. App Store for free iPhone apps on Christmas Day.
'SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY'
Front-of-mind for investors, though, will be how Meta's core digital advertising business is faring, after the tech giant said in October it faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter.
The company, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, warned it could face continued hits from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Meta's social media services Facebook and Instagram. Analysts said Meta had set the bar low for its coming earnings, but questions remained about these effects and about issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The Apple tracking change clearly had a negative impact on Facebook in the September quarter,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney. ""The question is, were they able to further mitigate that risk ... or did it become bigger?""
Pedro Palandrani, a research analyst at Global X, said the metaverse was the ""long-term story"" but in the near term investors would look for how Meta navigates Apple's policy as well as e-commerce updates and ways to monetize messaging or features like its short video offering, Reels. 

Meta, which reported 2020 revenue of about $86 billion, has yet to explain in detail how it will make money in the metaverse. In November, it pointed to potential opportunities for brands, from immersive shops to running paid mixed-reality events. The company has invited a group of ad execs to discuss its brand change and its plans for the metaverse at a virtual roundtable next month.
Meta is expected to report revenue of $33.38 billion, according to Wall Street estimates, up 18.9% year over year, and is expected to post quarterly earnings per share of $3.84, a slight decline. The company has said it expects total 2021 expenses to come in at $70 billion-$71 billion and full-year 2022 expenses to reach $91 billion-$97 billion.

Investing.com – Vodafone stock (NASDAQ:VOD) traded 4% higher in London on reports of activist investor Cevian Capital coming to own a stake in the telecom company.
The Nasdaq-listed ADRs were up 0.4%. 
Cevian has been in talks with Vodafone officials in recent months, pushing the carrier to improve performance, according to various reports.
The report said choices before the Swedish investment firm include pushing the British firm to consolidate its presence in key markets, selling some operations or pursuing stock buybacks.
The mobile services firm is present in the U.K., Germany, Italy, Spain and sub-Saharan Africa. It also has a joint venture in India but marked down the value of that business to zero more than two years back due to repeated losses and years of legal disputes that are now over.
At the time of its half-year results in November, Chief Executive Officer Nick Read talked up the company’s hunt to consolidate in its “major European markets”. Vodafone expressed interest late last year in acquiring CK Hutchison’s Three UK unit, Bloomberg reported this month.  Separately, it has also held discussions with Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) for a potential merger of their tower businesses.
According to Bloomberg, Cevian avoids public fights to begin with, preferring to build up a stake large enough to ensure that managements are forced to listen. It goes public only in the scenario of behind-the-scenes lobbying not having the desired outcome.
In the first half, Vodafone’s total revenue rose 5% to 22.5 billion euro ($25.2 billion) but profit fell more than 13% to 1.3 billion euro, mostly due to a one-time gain in the previous year.  
Vodafone joins the growing list of British companies witnessing heightened activity from activist investors pushing for changes. Others include Shell (LON:RDSa) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Macau Legend,, which owns and operates a casino resort in Macau, said its chief executive resigned on Monday after he was arrested and detained by police in the world's biggest gambling hub, sending shares down 19% to a record low.
CEO Chan Weng Lin's arrest https://www.reuters.com/world/china/police-arrest-macaus-no-2-junket-boss-crackdown-media-2022-01-30 comes as authorities have stepped up a crackdown on illicit capital outflows from the Chinese mainland, where all forms of gambling are illegal, and after the high-profile arrest of Suncity boss Alvin Chau https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/gambling-group-suncitys-shares-set-rise-61-after-arrested-chairman-resigns-2021-12-02 in November. 
Macau Legend said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that Chan resigned ""to avoid distraction"" to the company and for the interest of shareholders. It said it did not expect any adverse impact on its daily operations.
Police in the former Portuguese colony said in a statement on Monday that they had arrested two other people on charges of illegal gambling. They have arrested 15 people, including Chan and Chau, since November, on illegal gambling and money laundering charges. Six have been detained, they said.
Chan owns about a third of Macau Legend, which runs three casinos under a service agreement with SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF) and owns the Fishermans Wharf, an entertainment complex near the Macau ferry terminal. He is also chairman of Tak Chun Group, Macau's second-biggest operator of junkets - cross-border trips to Macau's casinos for high-spending gamblers - after Suncity. 
Tak Chun did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to reach Chan.
Analysts say the arrests herald a new era of zero tolerance of the promotion of gambling in China, in which the government supports development of the ""mass market"" segment, not high rollers.
Junket operators have traditionally offered easy credit to mainland Chinese VIPs, who play in Beijing-ruled Macau's casinos and handle their debts using underground financing channels.
Now nearly non-existent, the opaque VIP industry made up more than two-thirds of Macau's gambling revenue until just a few years ago.
Police said the latest arrests were linked to the Suncity case in November as the two groups - Suncity and Tak Chun -worked together, engaging in ""illicit and criminal activities"".

Suncity and Tak Chun have been the top two junket firms in Macau, employing thousands, but data from Macau's gambling regulator shows the number of licensed junkets has shrunk 46% over the past 12 months.
Shares in Macau Legend closed down 19% to a record low and fell as much as 29.8% to HK$0.40 during trading.

Investing.com – Citrix stock (NASDAQ:CTXS) fell 2.9% in premarket trading Monday on reports the firm could go private at a price below its Friday close of $105.55.  
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Elliott Management’s private-equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, and tech-focused Vista Equity Partners are likely to pay $104 apiece to take the software company private, valuing it at around $13 billion.
Bloomberg had in September reported that Citrix was working with advisers to explore a potential sale. The talks followed Elliott taking a 10% stake in the company. Elliott is known to chase companies to take steps to increase shareholder returns. This includes moves like reshuffling top management, forcing buybacks, and demands for better capital allocation.
Citrix specializes in remote access software solutions. That skill was in high demand during the pandemic and looks likely to remain so as more corporates integrate work-from-home into their overall business model.
After the initial dispapointment over its slow adoption of Cloud, the market is taking note of its transition to a more predictable subscription model. Annualized recurring revenue in its third quarter grew 13% from a year earlier. Citrix shares are down nearly 21% in last one year but are up about 30% in last five months.

1352,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 04:14AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Vodafone Rises on Cevian Interest; German CPI Eyed,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, ending a difficult month on a positive note while investors keep a wary eye on political developments between Russia and Ukraine.
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%.
Global stock markets have been hit hard in January, with the DAX, for example,  down over 3.5% as investors worried about rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat soaring inflation. 
There was a more positive tone Monday, helped by an easing of manufacturing bottlenecks for German companies in January, according to the Ifo economic institute.
The number of German manufacturers reporting problems procuring intermediate products and raw materials eased to 67.3% in January from 81.9% in December, Ifo said. 
While this release suggests problems still exist, any reduction will be welcomed as these disruptions translated into a contraction of 0.7% in the fourth quarter in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
Still, any gains are likely to be limited as investors focus on a meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss Russia's troop build-up on the border with Ukraine. 
Western countries are currently preparing sanctions to levy on Russia should it invade its former Soviet-bloc neighbor, something Britain called “highly likely” over the weekend. Such a move could have severe repercussions for Europe’s energy supplies if Russia decides to limit its natural gas output to the region. 
This turmoil has helped oil prices climb to near seven-year peaks, ahead of Wednesday’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to discuss future output.
U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded 1.1% higher at $87.75 a barrel, while the Brent Oil Futures contract rose 1% to $89.40. The benchmarks recorded their highest levels since October 2014 on Friday, and their sixth straight weekly gain. 
Staying in the oil sector, energy giant Shell (LON:RDSb) said it would begin trading with a single line of shares on Monday, ditching its A and B shares as part of plans to simplify its dual share structure.
Elsewhere,  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) stock rose 3.2% after news emerged over the weekend that activist investor Cevian had built up holdings in the telecoms giant, looking to improve its global business. 
KPN (AS:KPN) stock rose 1.5% after the Dutch telecom company reported a rise in core profit of 4% in the fourth quarter, as revenues from mobile services to consumers and companies grew.
Spanish inflation slowed to 6% year-on-year in January from 6.5% in December, mainly thanks to lower electricity costs, but the major economic data release will be the preliminary fourth-quarter gross domestic product for the Eurozone, which is expected to rise 0.3% on the quarter, a gain of 4.7% on the year. More importantly for the Eurozone, German CPI data later are also likely to show a fall in the annual rate of inflation, as the previous year's increase in VAT passes out of the calculations.
Additionally, Gold Futures rose 0.3% to $1,789.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1171.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 04:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Walk on the wild side,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni. 
The days of wild swings aren't over. And with bears and bulls still fiercely wrestling for control, investors could see their nerves tested again this week as geopolitical tensions build up and policy tightening remains centre stage.
So while the Bank of England is set to raise rates for the second time in a row and the Fed's Bostic said a supersized rate hike may be needed, the U.K. warned it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was looking to invade Ukraine and NATO voiced concern over Europe's energy security.
And if it weren't enough, North Korea tested an intermediate-range nuclear-capable missile for the first time since 2017. The U.S. said the test was part of an ""increasingly destabilizing"" pattern and urged Pyongyang to join direct talks.
With Chinese markets closed, European stock futures were up 1.5% ahead of the cash market open, powered by Friday's late rally on Wall Street to its best day this year following a frantic week of topsy-turvy trading. 
World shares have erased nearly $5 trillion of market cap this year and are set for their worst month since April 2020, in a downtrend partly cushioned by positive soundings from the earning season.
Weekend political events also brought some relief. 
The re-election of outgoing 80-year-old Italian President Mattarella means former ECB boss Draghi will carry on as prime minister. And in Portugal the Socialists won an outright parliamentary majority in a snap election, defying all odds. 

As a result, Italy's 10-year bond yields saw a chunky drop of over 6 basis points, narrowing the spread against the safer German equivalent.

MALAGA, Spain (Reuters) -Vodafone has teamed up with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and other silicon vendors to design its own chip architecture for nascent OpenRAN network technology, aiming to weaken the grip of traditional telecoms equipment suppliers. 
OpenRAN allows operators to mix and match suppliers in their radio networks, posing a challenge to the likes of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) that dominate the global telecoms equipment market with their proprietary technologies.
Development of OpenRAN has taken on greater prominence since some governments either banned or discouraged the use of China's Huawei in national networks. 
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s initiative, based at its digital innovation and R&D centre in Malaga, will also contribute to the European Union's efforts to bolster its chip industry and double its share of global production to 20% after it lost ground to Asian and U.S. suppliers.
Vodafone's director of network architecture Santiago Tenorio told Reuters that OpenRAN would enable the mobile operator to quickly add new digital services and to optimise networks using artificial intelligence (AI). 
""It will bring disruptive innovation back to the network,"" he said. 
OpenRAN creates interoperability between the software and hardware components of the radio access network, widening the pool of suppliers and lowering the barrier of entry. 
Vodafone switched on Britain's first 5G OpenRAN site carrying live customer traffic in Bath, western England, earlier this month, kicking off a deployment that will number 2,500 sites by 2027. 
The R&D centre - the first dedicated to advancing OpenRAN chip architecture - will bring 50 people dedicated to OpenRAN together with 650 software engineers, architects and technicians in the Spanish city, where the British company is investing 225 million euros ($251 million) over five years. It opens on Monday. 
Tenorio said Vodafone would design silicon for ARM and RISC-V instruction sets as well as Intel x86, although he added that Intel was up to three years ahead of rivals and had already played a key role in OpenRAN's development.

About 20 other vendors have joined the project, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), ARM and Lime Microsystems, with half of the total coming from Europe, the company said.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 04:00AM ET</span>","Shell begins trading under simpler, single-line share structure","(Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) began trading with a single line of shares on Monday after the British oil major confirmed the assimilation of its A and B shares over the weekend as part of plans to simplify its two-tier structure.
The group, which ditched ""Royal Dutch"" from its name earlier this month after moving its headquarters to Britain from the Netherlands, said its shares would start their dealings on the Euronext Amsterdam, the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.
""The assimilation has not altered the total number of shares held by any shareholder or ADSs (American Depositary Shares) held by any ADS holder,"" Shell said in its statement.
Its London-listed shares were up nearly 1% in early trade.

The oil company had floated plans of a simpler share structure in November and relocated its head office to London from The Hague, pushed away by Dutch taxes and climate pressure faced in court as the energy giant shifts from oil and gas.
Shell, which held its first board meeting in London on Dec. 31, introduced the two-class share structure in 2005 after a previous corporate overhaul.

The largest telecom provider in the Netherlands said it would buy back 300 million euros ($335 million) worth of its own shares this year, while it expected to increase its dividend by 5% over this year.
""Although cost savings were moderate, productivity increased considerably and improving service revenues supported growth in EBITDA, while free cash flow exceeded our guidance"", Chief Executive Joost Farwerck commented on KPN's 2021 results in a statement.
KPN's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the fourth quarter of last year increased 4%, to 584 million euros, in line with analysts' expectations. 
KPN said it expected core earnings to grow slightly again this year, as total revenues from corporate customers are set to stabilize toward the end of 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA is seen to rise to around 2.4 billion euros in 2022, from 2.35 billion euros last year.

KPN in recent years sold its international activities and now mainly sells bundles of telephone, internet and TV services on the Dutch market.

The disposals come after Shimao put up its assets worth 77 billion yuan ($12.11 billion) for sale to raise cash to repay its debts, offloading two other assets in the past two weeks for 3 billion yuan. 
The Shanghai-based developer said late on Friday it sold Hyatt on the Bund to state-owned Shanghai Land (Group) Co for 4.5 billion yuan.
Its chairman Hui Wing Mau also sold his 40% stake in a Hong Kong high-end residential development to Hong Kong investors CSI Properties and C C Land Holdings for HK$1.05 billion ($134.68 million), according to separate statements from the buyers late on Friday. 
Chinese state-owned property firms are expected to acquire more assets from private developers facing tight liquidity, analysts said, as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over a crisis-hit sector that accounts for a quarter of its economy.

1361,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 09:22PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, but Slowdown in Chinese Economic Recovery Continues","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning. However, Chinese data signaled a further slowdown in the country’s economic recovery, and the high probability of U.S. Federal Reserve interest-rate increases also weighed on investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% by 9:11 PM ET (2:11 AM GMT). December’s industrial production contracted 1% month-on-month, while retail sales grew 1.4% year-on-year.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.26%, with private sector credit growing 0.8% month-on-month in December.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.35% and will close early at 11 PM ET. Chinese and South Korean markets are closed for a holiday.
Chinese data released on Sunday showed that the  manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.1, and the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.1, in January. Both indexes were above the 50-mark indicating growth, but manufacturing output fell, and consumer spending was hit by COVID-19 outbreaks in the country.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 49.1. 
The Fed’s turn towards a more hawkish policy in its latest policy decision handed down during the previous week, alongside uneven corporate earnings, contributed to the recent market volatility.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that a 50 basis-point interest rate hike, or hikes at each policy meeting in 2022, is possible. But he added three quarter-point hikes starting March 2022 is the most likely scenario. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will speak later in the day.
Policy decisions from the European Central Bank and Bank of England are due on Thursday, while the Reserve Bank of Australia hands down its policy decision on Tuesday.
Companies including Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Exxon Mobil  Corp. (NYSE:XOM),  Ford Motor Co  . (NYSE:F), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB),  Qualcomm Inc  . (NASDAQ:QCOM),  Sony  Group Corp. (NYSE:SONY),  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), and UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) will also release their earnings throughout the week. U.S. data including the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing PMI, is due on Thursday.
Some investors remained cautiously positive that global stocks will see less volatility, even if only temporarily, after tumbling more than 6% in January.
The equity selloff “marks a long-overdue correction rather than the start of a bear market,” BCA Research Inc. analysts including Peter Berezin and Melanie Kermadjian said in a note.
“Stocks often suffer a period of indigestion when bond yields rise suddenly, but usually bounce back as long as yields do not move into economically restrictive territory,” the note added.
Other investors also took a positive view, with various speculative bubbles deflating without significantly affecting financial-market functioning or adversely impacting the economy, Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni said in a note.
This reduces “the chances of a recession and a bear market in the S&P 500,” the note added."
1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 06:35PM ET</span>","China home builders, suppliers issue spate of profit warnings as Evergrande woes bite","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -A growing number of Chinese construction and decoration companies are writing off assets or issuing profit warnings as debt woes at China Evergrande Group and other property developers debilitate their suppliers.
More such disclosures are expected during the upcoming earnings season, putting pressure on Chinese authorities to do more to limit the contagion from developers' financial crisis and avert job losses.
Guangzhou Holike Creative Home Co, a furniture maker, became the latest company to disclose losses linked to Evergrande, which has racked up over $300 billion in debt, including 200 billion yuan ($31.44 billion) owed to suppliers via commercial paper.
Holike said in an exchange filing on Wednesday it expects 2021 net profit to slump as much as 60% from a year earlier, hurt by receivables to Evergrande that are unlikely to be collected.
In addition, China's property market downturn has dented the value of a company it acquired in 2020, resulting in impairment losses, Holike said, adding it has slashed business with Evergrande and is seeking claims.
Beijing Jiayu Door, Window and Curtain Wall Co also flagged risks this week, saying it turned in a loss of up to 1.4 billion yuan last year, thanks to receivables from Evergrande that are likely to go sour. 
Earlier this month, Guangdong Pak Corp, a maker of lighting fixtures, said it forecast a 85%-90% drop in 2021 earnings, thanks to a jump in Evergrande-related impairment losses. And Shenzhen Wenke Landscape Co said it fell into the red last year due to Evergrande defaults. 
Most China-listed companies will start reporting annual results next month, with more such disclosures expected, as dozens of Chinese suppliers have disclosed debts owed by developers like Evergrande. Some have already set aside provisions.
And despite some easing measures taken by the government to ease developers' liquidity stress and support the cooling economy, recent data suggests the problem will get worse. 
Units of Shimao Group Holdings, Kaisa Group Holdings and Greenland Group were named and shamed this month in a list of Chinese companies ""consistently overdue"" on commercial paper payments.
And the total number of such delinquent firms jumped 26% in December from the previous month, according to the list compiler, the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange. [L1N2TS06Q]
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, is seeking a debt restructuring as it struggles to pay creditors, suppliers and investors in wealth management products. 
Shanghai Trendzone Holdings Group, a residential decoration company, said recently it had filed 333 lawsuits against Evergrande and its subsidiaries, and the impact on earnings is unclear before legal rulings.

(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp and Vista Equity Partners are close to buying Citrix Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CTXS) in a deal that values the U.S. cloud computing company at about $13 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The deal, which could be announced as soon as early this week, came after Elliott and Vista jointly tapped the loan market to fund their cash bid for Citrix at $104 per share. Once taking Citrix private, Vista plans to merge it with Tibco, another data analytics software firm it owns. 
The cash bid comes lower than where Citrix stock closed at $105.55 on Friday. Still, the price represents a premium to its lows in December. 
Citrix's products allow employees of companies to access their network remotely. However, it failed to capitalize on the rise of remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic because it spent too much on its salesforce and too little on its distribution partners, Citrix interim Chief Executive Robert Calderoni said on the company's most recent quarterly earnings call.
Citrix, Elliott and Vista did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Elliott, the hedge fund that has amassed a stake in Citrix, has been looking for partners to take the company private since last October, sources said.
While Citrix has struggled to transition to a subscription-based business, demand for its cloud services soared during the pandemic as companies shifted to remote working models.

Still, the company reported operating income of $84.5 million in the third quarter, down from $128.3 million a year ago, as higher operational expenses weighed. 
Calderoni took over on an interim basis from David Henshall, who stepped down last month, having served as Citrix CEO since 2017. Elliott managing partner Jesse Cohn joined the Citrix board of directors in 2015 and stepped down last year.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc will fire corporate employees who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by April 2, according to an internal company memo posted on the blog The T-MO Report.
The blog said T-Mobile's new policy was announced on Friday in an email from its human resource chief to all staff. It follows a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Jan. 13 that blocked President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccination-or-testing mandate for large businesses. 
""Employees who have not yet taken action to receive their first dose and upload proof by February 21 will be placed on unpaid leave,"" the blog quoted the memo as saying. ""Affected employees who do not become fully vaccinated ... by April 2 will be separated from T-Mobile."" 

The memo, addressed to ""all employees (excluding international),"" stated that the vaccine rules do not apply to field technicians and most in-store retail roles. 
In a statement on Saturday, T-Mobile said ""we are requiring office workers (with limited exception for certain roles, locations and legally mandated accommodations and exemptions) to be fully vaccinated by April 2."" It added that ""badge-controlled offices continue to be accessible only to those who are vaccinated against COVID-19.""

The company appointed the current non-executive chairman, Philippe Charrier, as new chief executive officer, it said in a statement.
Orpea's shares lost about half of their value last week after the publication of extracts of a book accusing the company of mistreatment on the elderly were published in a newspaper. The company has denied the accusations.
""Mr. Charrier's mission will be to ensure, under the Board’s control, that the best practices are applied throughout the company and to shed full light on the allegations made,"" the company said in a statement. 
The book ""Les Fossoyeurs"" (The Gravediggers) by journalist Victor Castenet, which went on sale on Wednesday, said food and care products in an Orpea home in a wealthy neighbourhood close to Paris were being rationed although the residents paid monthly fees of several thousand euros.
The company, under massive pressure from both the French government and shareholders, said last week it would hire two firms to look into mistreatment claims. These were still in the process of being designated, it said.

The strikes at branches in Berlin, Dortmund and Cologne as well as at the bank's call centre follow days of separate wage negotiations for the broader banking industry in Germany.
For months, unions and management at Germany's private and public sector banks have held multiple rounds of wage talks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wage-dispute-deepens-german-public-banks-inflation-fears-persist-2021-10-20 that would affect 200,000 workers. The outcome so far has been deadlock, punctuated by brief labour stoppages.
In Germany's private sector bank wage negotiations, including for Postbank employees, unions have wanted a 4.5% increase for the 140,000 staff represented in the talks.
Management rejected those demands and offered a one-off 500-euro payment.

Inflation in Europe's largest economy has gathered pace. In December, the national consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.3% year-on-year https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-inflation-eases-december-first-time-six-months-2022-01-06, the highest since June 1992 and an acceleration in price pressures after 5.2% in November.
Unions are using inflation as an argument for higher wages when German banks, faced with stiff competition, are trying to cut costs and reduce headcount. Central banks worry that higher wages could further entrench inflation.

A source with direct knowledge said the creditor is Oaktree. However Evergrande did not mention the name in the statement.
The assets are charged as security for a financing transaction for $520 million advanced to the group in January 2021, Evergrande said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
""The company is seeking legal advice to protect the legal rights of the company. At the same time, the company is in active discussions with the lender on resolving the matter with a view of reaching a resolution thereby maximising the return to the group.""
If there is residual value on the assets after the secured obligations have been discharged, Evergrande said it would give priority to offshore affairs.
It said the appointment of receivers for the subsidiaries and the potential sale of the relevant secured assets ""would not have material impact on the operations or financial position of the group, nor affect the group’s ongoing debt restructuring exercise."" 

Evergrande said on Wednesday it aims to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months as it scrambles to reassure creditors spooked by defaults since its finances began to unravel last year.

Malaysian factories, which include major suppliers of palm oil and medical gloves, have been under increased scrutiny over allegations of abuse of migrant workers, who make up a significant part of the country's manufacturing workforce.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said on Friday it would bar imports from disposable glove maker YTY Group based on information indicating that the firm used forced labour, the seventh such ban on a Malaysian company in two years. 
The agency also determined that Malaysian palm oil producer Sime Darby Plantation Bhd uses forced labour in its operations and that the company's goods were subject to seizure.
Malaysian Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan said on Sunday he would meet with all firms facing import bans in the United States, along with two glove makers - WRP Asia Pacific and Top Glove Corp. - that had seen their bans lifted by the CBP. 
""The approaches implemented by these two companies can be used as guidelines and improvements for other firms,"" Saravanan said in a statement. 
Saravanan said he had also ordered an immediate inquiry into the allegations by the Ministry of Human Resources and Department of Labour, and warned of stern action against companies that failed to improve their practices. 

The minister had acknowledged that forced labour allegations against Malaysian firms had affected investors' confidence in the country.

The action follows November's regulatory guidelines to stamp out monopolies in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). China leads the world in making and exporting these products. 

In a statement, the ministry of industry and information technology said it would ""strengthen law enforcement against unfair competition, and resolutely investigate unfair competitive acts, such as commercial bribery"". 
It will also stiffen enforcement of anti-monopoly laws in the areas of drug shortages and APIs, prepare and adopt antitrust guidelines in the API market and investigate monopolistic pacts, it added.

Mitchell acted in the aftermath of Wednesday's announcement by Spotify and Young that the platform would remove his music following the singer-songwriter's objection to his songs playing on the same service that offers a podcast by prominent vaccine skeptic Joe Rogan.
""I've decided to remove all my music from Spotify,"" Mitchell said in statement published on her website. ""Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.""
Young earlier in the week posted a letter on his website addressed to his manager and his record label demanding that Spotify no longer carry his music, writing, ""They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" The letter was later deleted from the site.

Rogan is the host of the top-rated podcast on Spotify.
Rogan, who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has long stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic, government mandates and COVID-19 vaccines. Rogan has questioned the need for these vaccines on his show and said he used ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug that has no proven benefit against COVID-19.

LONDON (Reuters) -CVC Capital Partners co-Chairman Steve Koltes will step down this year as Europe's biggest buyout firm prepares for a stock market listing that a source familiar with the matter told Reuters could value it at more than 20 billion euros ($22 billion). 
Koltes, who co-founded CVC in 1993 as a spinout from Citibank, will leave in October ""to focus on his private interests,"" the firm said in a statement. He will remain on CVC's board in a non-executive capacity.
CVC recently lined up banks to work on an initial public offering (IPO), following in the footsteps of rival funds including Bridgepoint Group and TPG which recently floated after decades in private hands.
In preparation for the IPO, CVC brought in outside capital in September when it sold a stake of roughly 10% to investment firm Blue Owl Capital Inc in a deal that valued the company at 15 billion euros ($16.7 billion).
That valuation could surge beyond 20 billion euros in the upcoming listing, considering the strong market debuts of rival firms, the source said.
CVC is looking to go public in the second half of the year with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) working on the plan. It may opt to float on the London Stock Exchange, although a final decision on the listing venue has yet to be made, the source said.
After Kotles's departure, co-Chairmen Donald Mackenzie and Rolly van Rappard - who worked closely with him in the early 1990s to establish CVC when it was still known as Citicorp Venture Capital London - will continue with the firm.
The pair praised Koltes for his ""wisdom and determination"" in transforming the firm into a global private equity powerhouse invested in more than 100 companies worldwide.
CVC, with $125 billion of assets under management, has been one of the most active investors during the pandemic, buying Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s tea business for 4.5 billion euros in November and then clinching a 1.9 billion euro deal to invest in Spain's top soccer league in December.
The firm is well known in the world of sports having backed both Formula One and the Six Nations rugby tournament. 

It is also one of the bidders in talks for a stake worth some 1.5 billion euros in the French soccer league's media rights business, four sources told Reuters in December.

The regulator of the state medical insurance fund said authorities ordered the arrest of all suspects, but did not give details of the suspected violations or the size of funds involved.
It demanded that AstraZeneca China close loopholes in supervision of marketing activities, the NHSA added. 
In a statement on Friday, the company said some employees in the southern city of Shenzhen had altered or participated in altering patients' testing reports, and were suspected of medical insurance fraud.
The NHSA and public security ministry held a meeting with company officials in December to brief them on the investigation, it added.
""AstraZeneca China takes such employee misconduct seriously and welcomes the recommendations by the NHSA and MOPS,"" it said. 
An AstraZeneca spokesperson said all employees involved in the Shenzhen case were Chinese nationals. 

The company has taken disciplinary action against those employees and has reported their violations to the authorities, the statement said. 
Authorities will launch nationwide campaigns to stamp out fraud that involves altering genetic test results, the NHSA added, urging those responsible for such violations to turn themselves in.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2022 06:10AM ET</span>",Analysis-Aerospace firms brace for turbulence in Russian titanium supplies,"By Mike Stone and Tim Hepher
WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Western aerospace companies have increased stocks of titanium and are scrambling to shore up supply chains in case the metal used widely in planemaking is thrust into a potential trade war between Russia and the West. 
Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's border as it presses demands for a new security arrangement in Europe, prompting U.S. and European officials to threaten a barrage of sanctions if it invades.
As a result, Western industrial companies are auditing their supply chains for Russian components in case Moscow retaliates.
Titanium, much of it supplied by Russia, has been used in commercial jet engines and other parts for decades. 
But its use has soared in recent years with the latest lightweight jets, such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus A350, reaching 14-15% of an empty jetliner by weight.
Neil Mitchill, chief financial officer of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), the world's largest aerospace contractor, told Reuters it was ""monitoring the developments"" and working to ensure its supply chain was secure for the coming 12 months.
The maker of Pratt and Whitney jet engines said it had two or more sources of titanium and other key raw materials, but did not give further details.
Boeing, which relies heavily on Russian titanium giant VSMPO-AVISMA, is ""protected for quite a while, but not forever,"" Chief Executive David Calhoun said on Wednesday.
Industry sources said Western aerospace firms have been increasing inventory or diversifying sources of supply since 2014 when Russia was sanctioned for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, even though titanium was not directly targeted. 
Their situation has been made easier by the fact that fewer jets are being assembled as a result of the pandemic, giving them opportunities to stockpile reserves.
""During the Crimea crisis, everybody created safety stocks and second sources of titanium but eventually nothing happened (on sanctions),"" a senior European industry source said.
No aerospace company contacted by Reuters would disclose its level of titanium stocks. 
STRATEGIC ASSET
Once a Cold War material used to build spy planes and submarines, titanium is widely seen as a test case for economic interdependence in strategic sectors like civil aerospace.
At the Dubai Airshow in November, Boeing provisionally renewed a two-decade partnership with VSMPO-AVISMA, agreeing to maintain it as its largest titanium supplier.
The world's biggest producer supplies 25% of global demand for titanium, a light but strong and corrosion-resistant metal also used in nuclear energy.
The same two companies also agreed to increase the use of a joint venture in Russia's Titanium Valley in the Urals.
Airbus and Brazil's Embraer also have long-term deals with VSMPO-AVISMA. 
Airbus said it was ""following the situation closely"".
VSMPO-AVISMA and Embraer said they had no immediate comment.
Airbus has said it relies on Russia for half its titanium needs, while a U.S. industry source said VSMPO-AVISMA provided a third of Boeing's requirements. 
For its part, VSMPO-AVISMA makes around three quarters of its sales from aerospace despite efforts to diversify.
In 2018, a draft law in Russia's parliament proposed restricting titanium exports in response to tightening Western sanctions. But the country's trade minister was reported saying the idea was blocked to prevent losing stable foreign buyers.
Even so, the outcome of a possible trade war if tensions boil over is difficult to predict, with stakes increasing as the United States threatens to target a key Russian gas pipeline.
S&P said last year Russia might limit exports of strategic materials due to tensions, but this was not the likeliest case.
The West is also unlikely to halt trade as it takes years to certify alternative suppliers, it said in a report.
The U.S. Commerce Department imposed restrictions on VSMPO-AVISMA in December 2020 only to reverse them three weeks later.
Targeting VSMPO-AVISMA would single out a strategic asset with close ties to Russia's defense industry, but quickly backfire on Western aerospace companies, industry sources said.
However, planemakers could still face higher titanium costs.
""Rather than iron-clad sanctions, it is more likely that supply constraints would raise prices broadly,"" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said.
Coming on top of inflation fears, the burden could fall most heavily on commercial jets where it is harder to pass on costs. ""The military side of the house can outbid anyone,"" he added.

In the United States, defense firms are shielded from any direct supply impact because the Pentagon generally dissuades contractors from using Russian raw materials. 
""Most seasoned government contractors are well aware of the perils of doing business with Russia,"" said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 08:30PM ET</span>","Wall Street rallies, capping frenetic week with best day of the year","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Friday, notching its best day so far in 2022 after another zigzag session, ending a tumultuous week marked by mixed corporate earnings, geopolitical turmoil and an increasingly aggressive Federal Reserve.
All three major U.S. stock indexes began the day in the red, but turned increasingly green as the session progressed, with tech shares doing the heaviest lifting.
The S&P 500 and the Dow posted gains from last Friday's close, but the Nasdaq was essentially flat on the week, capping five days of topsy-turvy trading.
Still, the bar for ""best daily gains of the year"" was rather low. Even with Friday's jump, the S&P 500 is down 7% so far in 2022, with the Nasdaq and the Dow suffering respective drops of 12% and 4.4% over the same time period.
""Investors are trying to adjust to the impact of this higher rate cycle,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""For some of them, stocks still remain more attractive than bonds in a rising rate environment, and they have been fishing around for where a bottom might be."" 
""You're seeing bargain-hunting in a number of stocks, particularly in the Nasdaq,"" Meckler added.
Economic data released on Friday showed a drop in consumer spending coupled with the lowest consumer sentiment reading in a decade, and year-on-year Core PCE prices - the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation yardstick - came in at 4.9%, slightly hotter than expected.
The graphic below shows how far core PCE and other major indicators have risen above the Fed's average annual 2% target. 
(Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gdvzynqmopw/inflation.png) 
The Fed made it clear at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday that they intend to take off their gloves and combat stubbornly persistent inflation by hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many market participants expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 564.69 points, or 1.65%, to 34,725.47, the S&P 500 gained 105.34 points, or 2.43%, to 4,431.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 417.79 points, or 3.13%, to 13,770.57.
Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but energy ended green. Tech stocks were the clear winners, gaining 4.3%, the biggest one-day jump for the sector since April 6, 2020.
Fourth-quarter reporting season was firing on all cylinders, with 168 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 77% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv data.
But investors have been increasingly focused on guidance, and the extent to which companies expect ongoing global supply challenges to affect their bottom line going forward.
""As we move into 2022, and as Omicron peaks and the weather improves, I expect supply-chain pressures to ease,"" Said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""(They) will probably peak sometime this quarter, and ease throughout the year.""
Data storage equipment maker  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) cited supply-chain headwinds after it reported lower than expected revenue and provided a disappointing forecast, sending its shares sliding 7.3%.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) fell 5.2% following the equipment maker's warning that higher production and labor costs will pressure its profit margin.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) dropped 3.5% on downbeat fourth-quarter profit.
However, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 7.0% jump gave the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq their biggest boost, the day after the company posted record iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.
 Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) surged 10.6% following its quarterly earnings beat driven by increased spending on international travel and e-commerce.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.92-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 753 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.80 billion shares, compared with the 12.10 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Friday it is considering alternatives to facial-recognition technology by commercial provider ID.me to verify identities for online taxpayer accounts after some lawmakers raised privacy concerns.
The Internal Revenue Service announced in November that it will transition this year to identity verification using ID.me technology for accessing online services including tax records and Child Tax Credit information.
The process involves uploading a ""selfie"" photograph to create an ID.me account and gained more attention this week as the IRS kicked off its annual tax return filing season.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that he was ""very disturbed"" by the prospect of taxpayers submitting to facial recognition.
Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, called the move a ""very, very bad idea,"" adding that facial recognition is less accurate with dark skin tones.
The American Civil Liberties Union called the ID.me facial recognition technology ""biased"" and ""glitchy."" 
A U.S. Treasury official said on Friday that Treasury and IRS are looking into alternatives to ID.me.
""The IRS is consistently looking for ways to make the filing process more secure but to be clear, no American is required to take a selfie in order to file their tax return,"" the department said in a statement. 
A spokesperson for ID.me could not immediately be reached for comment.
The company said in a statement on Monday that its technology complies with National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines to offer three ways to verify identity. 

The firm said it provides digital identity services to 10 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans affairs, and 30 U.S. states.
Treasury said in its statement that a lack of funding for modernization of IRS information technology systems has forced it to rely on ID.me and other third-party service.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -The United Steelworkers union (USW) rejected a pay increase offered by lead oil company negotiator Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) in talks for a new three-year agreement covering U.S. refinery workers, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The offer was for a 4% pay increase over three years for 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers represented by the union, the three sources said. 
Under the current contract, which expires Feb. 1, workers received pay increases of 3.5% in each of the contract's first two years and 4% in the third and last year.
Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said talks with the union were continuing.
""We’re in active discussions on various topics,"" Kheiry said. ""We are committed to bargaining in good faith and working toward a mutually satisfactory agreement.""
In a message to members on Friday afternoon that was seen by Reuters, the USW said Marathon was ignoring issues the union has raised in the talks that began on Jan. 13.
""Their wage proposals to date are paltry,"" the USW message said. ""In light of their earnings & dividends to shareholders, they are offensive. It's time for the companies to quit screwing around, recognize the seriousness of the approaching deadline and move towards a settlement.""
On Wednesday, the USW said in a message to members that Marathon had offered a 3% pay increase over three years. 
Going into talks, the union was seeking ""significant"" pay increases and improvements in health insurance, according to sources within the union.

Refiners and chemical producers began recovering in 2021 from large losses in 2020 when lockdowns and work-from-home policies drove down motor fuel demand.
In 2015, negotiations between the USW and then-lead company Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc broke down leading to a series of strikes nationwide. This is the first year Marathon is the lead negotiator.

That is double the $17.5 million he received for 2020. The board had then slashed $10 million from his $27.5 million pay to settle legal costs related to the bank's role in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd corruption scandal.
Solomon's total pay for 2021 includes an annual base salary of $2 million and a variable compensation of $33 million, 70% of which is in the form of goal-based stock compensation or restricted stock units. 
Other major Wall Street banks have also handsomely rewarded their chief executive officers as annual profits bounced back in 2021 thanks to pandemic-related loan loss provisions that did not materialize.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised CEO James Gorman's annual pay to $35 million, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) lifted Jamie Dimon's to $34.5 million.

Since taking over the reins from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018, Solomon, 60, has looked to diversify revenue, focusing more on predictable streams including consumer banking and wealth and asset management while reducing reliance on capital markets-focused businesses.
The bank reported a net income of $21.64 billion in 2021, compared with $9.46 billion a year earlier. It reported a 23% increase in fourth-quarter operating expenses, mainly due to higher compensation and benefits costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge found on Friday that tech tycoon Mike Lynch had masterminded an elaborate fraud to inflate the value of his company Autonomy before it was bought by Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion in 2011 in one of the UK's biggest tech deals. 
Lynch received a further blow later on Friday when Britain's interior ministry ordered his extradition to the United States to face criminal charges over the deal that carry a maximum prison term of 20 years. 
Lynch intends to appeal both the judge's finding and the extradition order, his lawyers said.
Finding in HP (NYSE:HPQ)'s favour following a near decade-long battle, Justice Robert Hildyard said the Silicon Valley company had won the majority of its civil case against Lynch although the damages to be announced at a later date would be significantly smaller than the $5 billion demanded. 
""The claimants have substantially succeeded in their claims,"" Hildyard told the High Court, in a one hour summary of his much longer judgment, following a nine-month trial and a two-year wait for his decision.
The judge said Lynch was aware that practices Autonomy engaged in were dishonest, its revenue recognition was improper and its accounts were false.
The court's decision coincided with a Friday deadline for Britain to decide whether or not to extradite Lynch.
Britain's interior ministry said that it had to sign the extradition order if there were no grounds to prohibit the order being made. The criminal charges in the United States include wire fraud and securities fraud.
""On 28 January, following consideration by the courts, the extradition of Dr Michael Lynch to the US was ordered,"" a Home Office spokesperson said. 
Lynch's lawyers said that as he is a British citizen who ran a British company, the case should not be resolved in the United States.
""Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the U.S. and will continue to fight to establish his innocence,"" lawyer Chris Morvillo said.
""This is not the end of the battle — far from it. Dr Lynch will now file an appeal to the High Court in London.""
FALL FROM GRACE
It is a dramatic fall from grace for Britain's most successful tech leader. 
The 56-year-old turned ground-breaking research at Cambridge University into the foundation of Autonomy, which became Britain's biggest software company and a member of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index.
He was lauded by academics and scientists, and asked to advise the government on technology and innovation.
Autonomy's ""almost magical"" capability, as it was once described by HP, was to search and organise unstructured information for clients, a killer application in a world of unlimited data and artificial intelligence. 
It was bought by HP, described by the judge as being in the doldrums at the time, in a move that was designed to transform the computer and printer maker into a more profitable business focused on software.
The acquisition turned sour almost immediately. 
HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion within a year and sought damages from Lynch and his finance director Sushovan Hussain. Hussain was convicted of fraud in the United States and sentenced to five years in prison in 2019. 
Lynch said HP did not know what it was doing, and was out of its depth in understanding his technology.
He spent 20 days on the stand during the case. 
Giving his verdict on Friday, Judge Hildyard found that Lynch and Hussain had fraudulently concealed a ""fire sale"" of hardware and engaged in convoluted reselling schemes to mask a shortfall in sales of Autonomy's software, the business HP coveted.
That had enabled Autonomy to meet quarterly financial forecasts and maintain its high share price before the acquisition. 
""HPE is pleased that the judge has held them accountable,"" a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) said after the London court ruling.

Lynch was also central to the creation of DarkTrace, a cyber security firm that listed on the stock market last year with a current value around $3.6 billion. Lynch and his wife Angela Bacares own nearly 16% of DarkTrace, according to Refinitiv data. 
HP sold the remnants of Autonomy along with other assets to British company Micro Focus in 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. lawmakers on Friday urged General Motors (NYSE:GM) and the Mexican government to safeguard worker rights ahead of a union vote next week of Mexican autoworkers at a pick-up truck plant in central Mexico. 
Representative Earl Blumenauer, who chairs a House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, along with Representatives Bill Pascrell and Dan Kildee raised concerns on Friday about reports of worker intimidation ahead of next week's union election at GM's Silao plant in Guanajuato, where it builds the Silverado. 
""It is imperative that GM and Mexico's labor authority ensure that every single worker may cast a secret ballot freely and without intimidation,"" the lawmakers said.
GM said Friday it has ""been absolutely committed to working with the Mexican authorities, the work force, vote observers and all partners, including the (Biden) Administration and U.S. Congress to provide the environment for a free and fair election.""
GM added it looks forward ""to working with whichever union leadership is selected by our work force,"" and addressing any worker concerns in a subsequent negotiation process.
Mexico's Federal Center for Conciliation and Labor Registration, which is organizing the vote, said on Friday it has inspected the plant to ensure access for voters and this week set up an email account to receive worker complaints, although none so far have been submitted.
For decades, workers across Mexico have often faced intimidation tied to contentious union votes.
The Center added that nearly 6,300 workers are eligible to cast ballots on Feb. 1-2 at five different areas of the plant, and that transportation will be provided to workers whose shifts fall on other days.
The United Auto Workers (UAW), which represents GM workers in the United States and last week also called for tighter scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/uaw-union-urges-gm-ensure-fair-workers-vote-mexico-2022-01-22 over the election, previously said as many as 7,000 people would be voting.
Workers will choose among four unions in line with a Mexican labor reform aimed at ensuring freedom of association, a key tenet of a new trade deal with the United States and Canada.
A vote last year on the collective contract was initially marred by irregularities, prompting the U.S. government to demand ramped-up scrutiny in a formal complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Workers eventually voted to dissolve the contract, opening the door to elect a new union.
U.S. officials in September closed https://www.reuters.com/business/us-trade-office-says-gm-mexico-labor-case-concluded-tariff-threat-lifted-2021-09-22 the GM complaint about last year's vote, but are still tracking the issue, a U.S. government labor committee report said last week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union aims to invest tens of billions of euros to bolster its chip industry and double its share of global production to 20%, the bloc's industry chief said on Friday, after a global shortage showed the risks of relying on Asian and U.S. suppliers.
The EU's ambitious plan comes after the United States last year announced its $52 billion CHIPS for America Act to better compete with Chinese technology.
""I do not want to give you today the level of investment, but it will be commensurate to what the U.S. wants to put in,"" European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists.
""We are working with all the different payments, especially national, European, regional, but of course I confirm that when you add all this we will have what we need and it will be commensurate,"" he said.
The EU Chips Act, announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last September and which the EU executive plans to flesh out on Feb. 8, will cover investments for the next 20-30 years.
The EU chip push includes setting up a programme financed by EU states targeting the production of cutting-edge chips and a design platform for producers, software companies and users to test new applications. 
Looser state aid rules will apply for European 'first of a kind' production facilities.

""We do whatever it takes to attract strategic investment. We set our conditions, first of a kind in Europe, security of supply, no state aid for catch-up technologies,"" Breton said.
""I want the EU to be a net exporter in semi-conductors like we are in vaccines. In geo-strategic industries like batteries or pharmaceuticals we do the same -- not do everything yourself but have the capacity if needed so that EU cannot be held hostage.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late on Thursday approved the country's 17th stock exchange, a subsidiary of Boston-based BOX Exchange, which will incorporate blockchain technology. 
The new exchange, named BSTX, aims to launch in the second quarter, said Jay Fraser, a director. It will initially trade securities, such as stocks or exchange-traded funds, first listed on its exchange, but those securities would be tradable on rival bourses.
BSTX ultimately aims to expand trading to all U.S. stocks and potentially tokenized securities, Fraser said. Stock tokens are digital versions of equities pegged to the underlying share, usually traded in fractional units.
Fraser said the aim is for BSTX to look ""more like"" crypto exchanges such as Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) as opposed to traditional exchanges like Nasdaq. 
In addition to traditional pricing data feeds, BSTX plans to offer a market data feed that will operate on a private blockchain. That feed will allow exchange members to see their own activity, as well as the activity of other BSTX participants on an anonymized, delayed basis, the exchange filing said.
The exchange plans to expand its use of blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, over time to support products like tokenized securities, Fraser said.
BSTX was originally going to be called the Boston Security Token Exchange and planned to exclusively trade tokenized securities, but the SEC rejected that plan in December of 2020.
The exchange will also give members the option to settle trades as quickly as the same day, as opposed to the current two-day standard settlement time, which would free up cash counterparties have to pledge against trades while also reducing the risk of either party defaulting. 
The securities industry as a whole is currently debating moving to single-day settlement.
In its Thursday notice, the SEC said https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/box/2022/34-94092.pdf that notwithstanding the blockchain feed and faster settlement times, BSTX's revised rules was ""substantively similar"" to the rules of other stock exchanges.

BSTX is a joint venture between BOX and tZero, which is providing the blockchain technology.
BOX is an options exchange jointly owned by Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX Group, Citadel Securities Principal Investments LLC, and brokers including arms of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and UBS.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 06:06PM ET</span>",Aeromexico reorganization plan confirmed after creditor deal,"By Maria Chutchian
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aeromexico on Friday won court approval of its restructuring plan after the airline struck a deal with the remaining holdouts among its creditors, clearing the way for it to emerge from bankruptcy with new controlling shareholders.
""I could not be more pleased to tell you the plan of reorganization is confirmed,"" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman said soon after the agreement to pay a settlement to the creditors was announced during a court hearing.
Her approval of the plan allows Aeromexico, one of three major Latin American airlines to seek court protection from creditors during the pandemic, to complete the bankruptcy process, which has been ongoing since June 2020.
Aeromexico shares were up 17% on Friday, although those gains did not appear to reflect the creditor deal and final approval, which came as the market was about to close.
The plan provides for new infusions of capital into Aeromexico. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), a frequent investor in distressed companies, will be the largest shareholder. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), an existing equity holder, is expected to have a 20% stake in the company once the plan is implemented.
The deals struck on Friday brought in support from a group of junior creditors who had opposed what they argued was overly beneficial treatment for Delta and four Mexican individual investors.
To resolve remaining issues with its most vocal plan opponent, Invictus Global Management, Aeromexico agreed to pay $1.1 million in cash. The airline also said it would provide a group of junior creditors $800,000 to cover legal fees.
Timothy Graulich of Davis Polk & Wardwell, who represents Aeromexico, said during Friday's hearing before Chapman that the company was ""truly grateful"" for the successful outcome.

""When we filed, we were literally almost out of money,"" he said.
The settlement came a day after Aeromexico announced another deal with the official committee representing unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares rallied nearly 7% on Friday in its biggest one-day percentage jump in a year and a half after the iPhone maker reported blockbuster results and teased its metaverse ambitions.
The Cupertino, California company's gain reduced some of the losses it has suffered in recent weeks during a broad selloff in growth and technology stocks. 
The world's largest company by market value raked in sales of nearly $124 billion and profit of $34 billion, showcasing its ability to navigate a global supply crunch during the crucial holiday quarter.
""Apple is known for its supply-chain prowess and many wonder about the actions Apple has taken and will take to better position itself for this calendar year,"" Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler said.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 04:41PM ET</span>",Easier to produce COVID vaccine shows promise in trials; nasal spray vaccine booster works in mice,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
New COVID-19 vaccine could be manufactured like flu shots
A COVID-19 vaccine that can be produced locally in low- and middle-income countries is yielding promising results in early clinical trials, researchers say.
The NDV-HXP-S vaccine, developed at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, uses an engineered version of the harmless Newcastle disease virus studded with coronavirus spike proteins to teach the immune system to recognize and attack the virus that causes COVID. Using blood samples from trial participants, researchers found that NDV-HXP-S induces proportionally more antibodies that can neutralize the virus and fewer non-neutralizing antibodies than the current mRNA vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech, they reported on Friday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
""The NDV-HXP-S vaccine induced neutralizing antibody responses against wild type (the original) SARS-CoV-2 that matched what we see after mRNA vaccination, but the proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the response was higher for NDV-HXP-S,"" said Mount Sinai's Florian Krammer. The vaccine can be manufactured like flu vaccines at low cost in chicken eggs at influenza vaccine manufacturing plants around the world, his team said. Early clinical trials with a live version are underway in Mexico and the United States, while an inactivated version is being tested in Vietnam, Thailand and Brazil, a spokesperson said. Mid-stage trials of the inactivated vaccine have also been completed and pivotal randomized trials are being planned. 
Intranasal booster uses virus spike to enhance immunity
Once the body has been ""primed"" by mRNA vaccines to recognize and attack the coronavirus, a booster containing purified versions of virus' spike protein that could be given intranasally would have many advantages, researchers believe.
Their ""Prime and Spike"" strategy employs a booster vaccine currently being tested in animals. In mice with waning immunity after two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, the purified spike protein vaccine strongly boosted first- and second-line immune responses to the virus in the nose, lungs and blood and protected against lethal doses of the virus, researchers reported on Wednesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Furthermore, the mice had lower-than-expected viral loads, which would likely reduce transmission. In mice whose immune systems had not been ""primed"" with the mRNA vaccine, the spike protein vaccine had no effect, however, because it takes advantage of the body's adaptive immunity, building on what the immune system has learned from the mRNA vaccine.
""This strategy is likely to confer long-lasting and cross-reactive memory that can be quickly restimulated to prevent viral spread,"" study leader Akiko Iwasaki of Yale University explained on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""The intranasal spike protein booster will also be much easier to administer (via nasal spray) ... and is much more likely to be accepted by people who are hesitant of mRNA or those with needle phobia.""
Lung transplants can help sickest COVID-19 survivors
People who need lung transplants as a result of COVID-19 do just as well afterward as those who get new lungs for other reasons, early data suggest.
The findings are reassuring, researchers say, because poor outcomes might rule out these patients' transplant eligibility even if their lungs were completely destroyed, given the shortage of available organs. From August 2020 through September 2021, 3,039 lung transplants were performed in the United States, 7% of which were done in COVID-19 survivors whose lungs had been irreparably damaged by the virus, researchers reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Overall, 197 COVID survivors received two lungs and 17 received single lungs. Some patients also required new hearts or kidneys. The survival rate at three months post-transplant was 95.6%, which ""approached that among patients who underwent lung transplantation for reasons other than Covid-19,"" the researchers said.

It is unclear how well these patients will do in the long term, but it appears ""that lung transplantation may be an acceptable treatment for selected patients with irreversible respiratory failure due to COVID-19,"" they concluded.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 04:41PM ET</span>",Chevron kicks off oil industry's Q4 results with a miss,"By Sabrina Valle
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Friday reported a fourth quarter profit that missed Wall Street estimates and offered a weak outlook for this year's oil and gas production, sending its shares lower.
The first major oil company to report fourth quarter results posted earnings of $5.1 billion, or $2.65 a share. Analysts had forecast a $3.12 per share profit, Refinitiv showed, expecting a bigger boost from rebounding prices. 
The below-par profit came despite higher oil and gas prices that were expected to lift results for the top energy companies.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) reports fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday and Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc on Thursday. 
""The miss was driven by international upstream primarily,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, deputy head of European research at RBC Capital Markets. ""Downstream earnings also disappointed, with weakness across both refining and chemicals.""
Chevron's oil and gas production fell 5% to 3.12 million barrels per day (bpd) with the largest drop coming from the loss of Indonesian and Thai production licenses. It also took a $575 million hit from timing of bookings in its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business after production declines in Australia and impairments.
Full-year earnings of $15.6 billion were the best since 2014 and compare with a $5.5 billion loss in 2020. Chevron, as other major oil producers, deeply cut spending as the COVID-19 pandemic slashed oil demand. It cut capital investments by about half since 2019, to $11.7 billion last year.
Investors had this week pushed Chevron shares to an all-time high on expectations that rising oil prices would drive earnings. Shares on Friday fell 3.5% to $130.67, the biggest once-day drop since August. 
(Graphic: Down from a record high, https://graphics.reuters.com/CHEVRON-RESULTS/zgvomjbzgvd/chart.png) 
""A weak performance across the board,"" Jefferies analysts wrote, adding that a forecast for dim production this year would disappoint investors.
Chevron projected oil and gas production would be flat to 3% less this year due contract expirations in Indonesia and Thailand that it no longer viewed as competitive. It expects production to increase this year in the Permian shale basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and in Australia.
""I expect 2022 will be even better for cash returns to shareholders,"" Chief Executive Michael Wirth said in a conference call. ""We’re more capital and cost efficient."" 
Quarterly operating results were, however, below analyst forecasts in its oil and gas production and refining businesses. Operating profit was $5.2 billion, up from $501 million in the same period a year ago, but below analyst expectations for about $6.6 billion operating profit.
Fourth quarter earnings from downstream and chemicals were $760 million, down from the $1.31 billion in the third quarter but up from a loss of $338 million year-on-year. The business suffered lower chemical margins and volumes, Chevron said. 
But better results than a year ago has enabled Chevron to increase shareholder returns and pay down debt. 

There was ""an impressive $6 billion reduction"" in outstanding debt, said Peter Speer, senior vice-president at credit-rating firm Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The company said it will buy back about $1.25 billion in shares during the first quarter, at the higher end of its guidance. Chevron this week raised its dividend by 6% to $1.42 per share.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 04:36PM ET</span>","Caterpillar sales soar, warns of margin pressure","By Bianca Flowers and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) topped Wall Street estimates with a fourth quarter revenue increase of more than 20 percent, but the heavy-equipment maker warned operating margins in the current quarter could be hit by higher production and labor costs. 
Shares of the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker fell 6 percent in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Factory shutdowns, clogged ports and labor shortages triggered by the pandemic have hammered companies across industries over the last year, causing manufacturing costs to soar and production lines to freeze.
“Supply chain has been a wild card for all of us in 2021,” Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told Reuters in an interview. 
Caterpillar said it expects to raise prices again this year, after hiking rates twice last year, to help mitigate some of the soaring costs.
Public spending, like U.S. President Joe Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure law, are giving Caterpillar's customers the confidence to buy new equipment, Bonfield told investors on a call. 
Higher demand and Caterpillar's ongoing cost-control measures have helped anchor the company’s bottom line, but supply chain constraints are weighing on operating margins.
""The broad-based strength in demand was overshadowed by higher-than-expected manufacturing costs due to production inefficiencies,"" said Rene Lipsch, Senior Credit Officer for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Corp. 
The company said it expects headwinds to its adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter versus a year earlier, but sees improvement throughout the rest of the year.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled an imminent rise in short-term interest rates could come as early as March. With rates being near zero since the onset of the pandemic, the Fed anticipates tighter monetary policy and strong job growth could help tame inflation, though some analysts predict it will do little to relieve supply-chain snags.
""Given the overall demand outlook that's strong, I don't think a rise in interest rates will have an impact on the supply chain in the near term,"" said Chad Dillard, senior analyst at Bernstein.
Total revenue rose 23% to $13.80 billion in the fourth quarter as construction demand across most of its regions saw unprecedented public spending.
Analysts, on average, had estimated revenue of $13.15 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company reported a profit of $2.12 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $780 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Caterpillar earned $2.69 per share, topping analysts estimates for $2.26 a share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 delivered a weekly win Friday, as an Apple-led resurgence in tech helped the broader market recover losses from earlier this week when the Federal Reserve signaled a steeper pace of rate hikes. 
The S&P 500 rose 2.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7%, or 565 points, the Nasdaq jumped 3.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 7% after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates following better-than-expected iPhone sales despite a drag from supply-chain issues.
The tech giant also said it expected supply-chain problems to improve, boosting sentiment on broader tech stocks.
“[Tim] Cook is calling out some supply chain improvement for the March quarter which are ‘calming words heard around the tech world’ and much needed good news in what has been a market storm to start 2022,” Wedbush said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the day up more than 1%. 
As well as bullish earnings, tech was also helped by a fall in U.S. bond yields following economic data showing inflation continues to gather steam at a time when the consumer has pulled back on spending.
Consumer spending fell 0.6% in December, representing the largest monthly decline since February. The slowdown in spending, however, was largely attributed to the impact of the Omicron variant.
“Spending was hit hard by a combination of the Omicron hit to discretionary services and people’s willingness to visit malls, alongside a void left by earlier-than-usual holiday shopping, triggered by fears of shortages of popular items,” according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, rose by 4.9% the fastest pace since 1983.
Visa (NYSE:V) was also a big gainer on the day, up above 10%, after delivering fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates as stronger cross border payment volumes bolstered growth.
“After sentiment shifted away from established payment companies, Visa’s relative valuation/growth presents a significant buying opportunity for investors focused on sustainable growth,” Oppenheimer said in a note.
 Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD), meanwhile, delivered disappointing guidance on revenue for its fiscal first-quarter after users fell in the fourth quarter, but the shares of the trading platform pared losses to close more than 9% higher.  
Energy proved an exception to the rally, weighed down by a more than 3% decline in  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) after the oil major reported quarterly results that missed on the bottom line.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a Dow index bellwether, was also nursing losses of more than 6% as better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by a fall in margins as supply-chain woes drove up costs."

(Reuters) -Union Pacific Corp plans to buy 10 battery locomotives from  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said on Friday, as the rail company moves away from diesel fuel to meet a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.
The announcement was made as customers of the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker are trying to reduce their carbon emissions by relying less on gas and diesel for transportation.
 Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) later said it will be adding 20 electric battery locomotives to its railroads for more than $100 million. In addition to its deal with Caterpillar, the company will acquire the other half of rail vehicles from Wabtec Corporation.
""We have other transactions in the transportation space around locomotives,"" Bonfield said in an interview with Reuters to discuss Caterpillar's fourth-quarter results https://www.reuters.com/business/caterpillar-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2022-01-28, which showed it topping Wall Street estimates with a revenue increase of more than 20%.
""All of those (sustainability) efforts are helping other parts of our business.""
Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said during the company's earnings call that Union Pacific, the largest U.S. railroad operator by market value, is the fourth customer for Caterpillar's rail battery electric locomotive technology. 

Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz said in a statement that the purchases would help the company reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rallied Friday, as blowout quarterly results from Apple put tech back into the driving seat following a recent rout amid jitters about a faster pace of U.S. Fed rate hikes. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.56%, or 189 points, the Nasdaq jumped 1.6%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose more than 5% after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates following better-than-expected iPhone sales despite a drag from supply-chain issues.
The tech giant also said it expected supply-chain problems to improve, boosting sentiment on broader tech stocks.
“[Tim] Cook is calling out some supply chain improvement for the March quarter which are ‘calming words heard around the tech world’ and much needed good news in what has been a market storm to start 2022,” Wedbush said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were in the green. 
As well as bullish earnings, tech was also helped by a fall in U.S. bond yields following economic data showing inflation continues to gather steam at a time when the consumer has pulled back on spending.
Consumer spending fell 0.6% in December, representing the largest monthly decline since February. The slowdown in spending, however, was largely attributed to the impact of the omicron variant.
“Spending was hit hard by a combination of the Omicron hit to discretionary services and people’s willingness to visit malls, alongside a void left by earlier-than-usual holiday shopping, triggered by fears of shortages of popular items,” according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, rose by 4.9% the fastest pace since 1983.
Visa (NYSE:V) was also a big gainer on the day, up 9%, after delivering fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates as stronger cross border payment volumes bolstered growth.
“After sentiment shifted away from established payment companies, Visa’s relative valuation/growth presents a significant buying opportunity for investors focused on sustainable growth,” Oppenheimer said in a note.
 Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD), meanwhile, delivered disappointing guidance on revenue for its fiscal first-quarter after users fell in the fourth quarter, but the shares of the trading platform pared losses to trade more than 7% higher.  
Energy proved an exception to the rally, weighed down by a more than 4% decline in  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) after the oil major reported quarterly results that missed on the bottom line.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a Dow index bellwether, was also nursing losses of more than 6% as better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by a fall in margins as supply-chain woes drove up costs."
1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 03:16PM ET</span>",U.S. corporate bond spreads widen as investors de-risk on hawkish Fed,"By Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sold U.S. corporate high-yield and investment-grade bonds on Friday, moving in step with weakness in equity markets and in a sign of risk aversion amid worries about a series of interest rate hikes.
The Markit North American High-Yield CDX Index, which tracks the cost to insure high-yield corporate debt and is a proxy for the junk market, fell in price to a low of 105.947%, the lowest since Nov. 2020, as investors sold the contract betting on credit deterioration. 
That was down around 1 percentage point from Wednesday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted at multiple interest rate increases this year.
Spreads on Markit's North American Investment Grade CDX Index rose to 62.5 basis points, hitting their highest since Nov. 2020, as investors hedged bets on a deterioration in credit quality.
Investors pulled out of U.S. corporate bonds in tandem with weakness across the U.S. major stock indexes after the Fed signalled in a policy update this week that an interest rate hike could be coming soon and that it would push forward with policy tightening measures to fight unabated inflation.
""People are expecting a bunch of rate hikes, they're expecting the (Fed) balance sheet runoff to be faster and sooner than people had expected even a couple months ago"", said Ryan O'Malley, a fixed income portfolio manager at Sage Advisory in Austin, Texas.
Spreads, which refer to the interest rate premium investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer U.S. Treasury bonds, narrowed last year as government debt yields dropped, driving money into securities with lower credit ratings than Treasuries.
""Money has been pushed out to the far ends of the risk spectrum, because you couldn't get anything out of the front end in Treasuries or investment grade ... Now that the tide is kind of going back out, people don't want to own the riskier stuff anymore"", said O'Malley.
The yield spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, rose to 346 basis points on Thursday from 325 bps on Wednesday, after the Fed update.
Still, while rising spreads are consistent with a decline in risk appetite, some investors expect them to only rise a little due to a still strong economic background.
""I don't think spreads should widen in the corporate sector ... corporates are in strong financial positions, they have benefited from two years of easy money,"" said Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global.

For research firm Capital Economics, unless equity market weakness triggers a broader loss of investor confidence, spreads are likely to rise only marginally in the next few years.
""This is underpinned by our view that, while global economic growth will slow, the economic backdrop is still likely to be fairly positive; we are not anticipating anything that would significantly challenge firms’ ability, in general, to service their debts,"" it said in a report on Friday.

Investing.com — Shares of  Calix Inc  (NYSE:CALX), the cloud and software services provider, rose 12% Friday after analyst Christian Schwab at Craig-Hallum upgraded them to buy from hold with a price target of $55.
The firm upgraded the stock after the company reported its fourth quarter results on Wednesday, with revenue and earnings coming in above consensus estimates. 
Schwab referenced the recent slide in Calix shares, believing it provides a good entry opportunity.
""With shares down ~50% in the last month, we are upgrading CALX to a Buy rating and maintaining our $55 price target. Our price target is based on 5.0x EV/S on our FY22 revenue estimate of $740 million,"" he said. 
""We are encouraged by the fact the company's All Platforms products continue to ramp with Platform's revenue crossing over 50% vs. legacy product revenue for the first time in Q4.

He added that ""combined with Affirm's own amazing retail traction plus Amazon, we see material upside into results."" Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has Affirm as a buy now pay later option.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, said on Friday its workforce has grown by about 12,000, recovering some jobs it lost earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company said its dozens of businesses now have about 372,000 employees, up from 360,174 at the end of 2020.
Berkshire had shed more than 31,000 jobs in 2020 as economies slumped and demand for many goods and services fell. The decline included about 13,400 jobs at Berkshire's Precision Castparts aircraft parts unit and 5,600 at the BNSF railroad.
Jobs were added last year as the U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace since 1984, according to Commerce Department data.
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett's assistant.
Other Berkshire units with large workforces include auto insurer Geico, Fruit of the Loom underwear, McLane food delivery, several energy businesses, and Clayton Homes.
Berkshire disclosed its recent job count in a registration statement for the sale of bonds.

Buffett, 91, is expected to discuss Berkshire's performance in his annual shareholder letter on Feb. 26, when the company will also release year-end results.
Analysts on average expect full-year operating profit to exceed the previous $24.8 billion high set in 2018. Operating profit totaled $21.9 billion in 2020.

Two sources close to the matter said Caltagirone's move did not stem from disagreements with fellow pact members but was intended to prevent regulators from saying the pact was not a mere consultation accord. 
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are, respectively, Generali's second- and third-largest investor. Their agreement, which was later joined by a third smaller Generali investor, related to a combined stake of over 16% in Italy's leading insurer.
Caltagirone, a construction and newspaper magnate, on Thursday informed other members he had decided to leave the consultation accord, the letter showed.
He said in the document he would present a slate of candidates for Generali's board, which comes up for renewal in April, adding a joint list of board nominees had never been among the pact's commitments. 
Generali shareholders will be called to appoint a new board on April 29.

The insurer's outgoing board is drawing up a list of nominees for its renewal with the backing of Mediobanca, which owns 12.8% of Generali but has secured a temporary 17.2% voting stake for the April meeting by borrowing shares.
The Generali board's list includes current CEO Philippe Donnet, which Caltagirone and Del Vecchio want to replace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Friday it has agreed that  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) can safely turn on more towers for C-Band 5G deployment.
The FAA said it and the wireless carriers ""have agreed on steps that will enable more aircraft to safely use key airports while also enabling more towers to deploy 5G service."" The FAA said more precise data about the exact location of wireless transmitters allowed it ""to determine that it is possible to safely and more precisely map the size and shape of the areas around airports where 5G signals are mitigated, shrinking the areas where wireless operators are deferring their antenna activations.""
AT&T and Verizon on agreed on Jan. 18 to temporarily not turn on about 510 towers near airports over the FAA's concerns about interference with airplane radio altimeters averting what major airlines had said would be a ""catastrophic"" impact on U.S. aviation.
The FAA plans to issue updated documents as soon as later on Friday to allow for more operations in poor weather ""with new runways that previously were unavailable. We're getting them to the operators as quickly as possible so they can make scheduling decisions.""
CTIA, an industry trade group representing wireless carriers, said called the FAA announcement ""a positive development that highlights the considerable progress the wireless industry, aviation industry, FAA and (Federal Communications Commission) are making to ensure robust 5G service and safe flights.""

The FAA added that ""5G signals from some existing towers that were inside the old protected areas but are outside the new protected areas do not pose unacceptable safety risks to aircraft approaching airports in low-visibility conditions. Therefore, the FAA was able to newly approve certain aircraft – specifically Airbus and Embraer 170/190s – for low-visibility approaches at airports where they couldn’t previously make them.""
Airline industry officials say the FAA plans to further refine the zones around airports at a later date that will allow Verizon and AT&T to use additional towers near airports. About 500 of the towers that were not turned on last week are Verizon towers, officials told Reuters.

Like its peers, Colgate has started to charge more to deal with elevated raw materials and logistics costs, and it’s now watching for shoppers’ reaction. Given the magnitude of the price hikes, “you will see a fall off in volume,” Chief Executive Officer Noel Wallace said Friday during the company’s fourth-quarter conference call. 
Since price increases are broad-based across the industry, Colgate expects the reaction won’t be as sharp as it normally would be. The company’s organic sales, which strips out currency swings, grew 3% in the fourth quarter -- but the volume of products sold was flat compared to a year earlier.
U.S. consumer spending, after adjusting for inflation, declined last month by the most since February. This suggests Americans are pulling back amid a renewed Covid-19 spike and the highest inflation in nearly 40 years. Companies are likely to still see revenue climb -- but the growth will come from higher prices instead of more units being sold.  
 Church & Dwight  (NYSE:CHD) reported a similar trend, saying Friday that while its fourth-quarter organic sales growth exceeded its outlook, that was due to higher prices. Volume dipped 1.7%. 
Colgate plans on spending as much as $240 million before taxes to streamline its supply chain and reduce costs. It’s expected to save as much as $110 million annually, with the benefits starting to be observed in the second half of the year. The company will also try to retain consumers by making its products more appealing and introducing new ones. 
Colgate shares fell 0.7% at 12:52 p.m. in New York trading. The stock had climbed 6% in the 12 months through Thursday, below the 16% gain for the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Church & Dwight shares rose 3.5% Friday; the stock had gained 12% in the year through Thursday.

Investing.com — Shares of insulin pump technology firm Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) surged more than 15% Friday after it said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared its Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System for type 1 diabetics age six and older.
The Omnipod 5 is said to be the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that works with the Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) G6 continuous blood glucose monitoring system and a smartphone to automatically adjust insulin according to the user's need to protect against highs and lows.
The product is designed so that users no longer have to take daily insulin injections and take regular blood glucose tests. Currently, type 1 diabetics either have an insulin pump that administers insulin via a tube or take injections around four or five times a day. 
The Omnipod 5 represents Insulet's first foray into the automated insulin dosing market.
""Omnipod 5 is a life-changing technology that we believe will revolutionize the market and the lives of people with diabetes,"" said Shacey Petrovic, president and CEO of Insulet.
Piper Sandler analysts said the announcement is a ""clear positive"" for Insulet after previous delays in getting the product cleared. 
However, Piper expects the revenue impact in 2022 will be somewhat muted as the product will roll out slowly."

The 145-year old family-owned company unveiled the new pasta this week, packaged in bright red cartons, which will distinguish it from Barilla's traditional pasta packaged in dark blue boxes. Both the blue and red boxes will carry a new Barilla logo.
Barilla said the new pasta will be sold in eight European countries, including Italy, and in Australia this year. It did not disclose any sales targets.

The new pasta range is made by pushing the pasta dough through bronze dies which produces a more intense taste and a rougher surface for the sauce.
The blue boxes for Barilla's classic pasta will no longer have a plastic window, which the company expects will cut its plastic consumption by 126 tonnes a year.

The warning by Monica Aspe, chief executive of AT&T Mexico, comes days after Mexican regulators withheld a pay TV permit from America Movil amid complaints from rivals the move would further enhance its dominance.
Aspe said Mexican regulators needed to maintain an even playing field to keep companies such as AT&T in the country. 
""Our wish is to be able to continue to grow in the country in the coming years. However, like the future of any global company, the presence in a particular market is periodically analysed,"" Aspe said in a statement, which an AT&T spokesperson sent to Reuters in full.
America Movil dominates the Mexican telecom market, controlling 70% of mobile internet services and more than 62% of mobile phone services, according to data from Mexico's regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT).
Controlled by the family of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, America Movil has been barred from entering the pay-TV market in its home country since the 1990s.
""We don't ask for special privileges. We ask that (America Movil) is obliged to comply with regulatory and legal requirements... If that happens, we'll continue to compete here,"" Aspe added.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co are expected to report next week they turned solid profits for the last quarter of 2021, but rarely has past performance mattered less to investors.
The two Detroit automakers are in mid-leap between a combustion-powered present, and a future they have promised will be defined by electric vehicles and software-powered services.
Both companies have mapped out multibillion-dollar investments in new North American electric vehicle and battery factories, aimed at challenging Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and a flock of smaller EV startups in the still-tiny market. But those new factories will not be at full speed until the middle of this decade.
Though GM and Ford were once giants of the global auto sector, their market capitalizations have been dwarfed by EV maker Tesla. Tesla on Wednesday reported stronger than expected revenue and profit for the fourth quarter of 2021, but warned that supply-chain bottlenecks would continue through 2022 and likely prevent its factories from running at full capacity.
GM last year sold fewer vehicles in the United States than  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, the first time in 91 years that GM was not the No. 1-selling automaker in its home market.
GM and Ford's profits in 2021 were lifted by consumers willing to pay record-high prices for petroleum-powered pickup trucks and SUVs. In 2022, analysts are concerned the Detroit manufacturers will face a more uncertain economic environment, including rising interest rates, high oil prices and continuing supply-chain bottlenecks that could curtail production. 
Analysts expect both companies to be cautious in their outlooks for 2022. Shortages of semiconductors are expected to weigh on production into the second half of the year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) wrote in a note.
""While automakers will enjoy production recovery and inventory restocking, (those) could be coupled with price declines, mix deterioration, rising input costs,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Ford told investors in its third-quarter report that it expected $1.5 billion in higher commodity costs, and saw inflationary pressures across a broad range of expenses. 

Wall Street has shown more confidence over the last several months in efforts by Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, to accelerate the company's electric pickup truck and van programs. Ford's market value hit $100 billion in mid-January, exceeding GM's value for the first time in more than five years. But the market value of Ford, whose quarterly results are expected on Thursday afternoon, has since dropped by 20% after the company issued a complicated reworking of its 2021 profit guidance. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is expected to have a more straightforward story to tell on Tuesday about fourth-quarter and full-year results. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors in December the company expected adjusted pretax profit for 2021 to reach $14 billion, higher than previous forecasts.

Investing.com — Shares of apparel and footwear company VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) hit lows of $62.12 Friday despite reporting a top and bottom-line beat in its earnings report.
The shares were down 5% as of midday.
The company announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 on revenue of $3.62 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.21 on revenue of $3.61 billion.
The company told investors that the spread of the Omicron variant is affecting global sales. However, the company's president was upbeat in his comments.
""We delivered strong double-digit top and bottom-line results and returned about $500 million in cash to shareholders in the third quarter, all of which has been achieved amidst continuing macro headwinds,"" said Steve Rendle, VF's chairman, president and CEO.
The company has been facing labor and manufacturing shortages and cut its revenue forecast for full-year 2022 to approximately $11.85 billion from $12 billion, reflecting growth of around 28%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be about $3.20, above the $3.17 consensus.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Hotels and restaurants in China's big cities are bracing for a rush of guests over the Lunar New Year as people forced by COVID-19 curbs to give up plans to go home for family re-unions opt instead to stay put and celebrate in other ways.
The week-long holiday, which begins on Monday, is a peak travel period in China with millions heading home from the cities they work in to celebrate with families. 
But local governments are advising people not to go anywhere because of a spate of new COVID-19 clusters, with some authorities making people arriving in their hometowns go into quarantine.
Authorities have estimated that, based on numbers from 36 cities, that 48 million people who travelled during the Lunar New Year last year will stay put this time.
This has meant that many restaurants in big cities, which usually close for the holiday as all their staff head home, are staying open.
Hotels are seeing an increase in bookings, travel agencies and hotel companies said, especially from customers keen to treat themselves to a little luxury.
""The more expensive the room is, the quicker it's booked out,"" said travel search engine Qunar.com, adding that it had seen hotel bookings for the Lunar New Year period triple compared with last year. 
Occupancy for the InterContinental Hotels Group is also up across China compared with the holiday last year, the company's Greater China Chief Operating Officer Jerome Qiu told Reuters. 
""The third and fourth days of the holiday period are normally peak demand,"" Qiu said. ""Based on the current pattern, this year's strong performance may cover a longer period starting from the New Year's Eve."" 
MONEY TO SPEND
Over the Lunar New Year holiday last year, from Feb. 11 to Feb. 17, Chinese consumers spent 821 billion yuan on retail and catering, up 28.7% from the holiday in COVID-ravaged 2020 and up 4.9% from 2019.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said she was expecting a 10% increase in spending from last year, saying that the COVID situation was not severe enough to stop people from getting their wallets out.
""Even if people can't travel, they still have money to spend if they don't spend it on transport,"" she said. 
""Some people are saving their December spending for the Chinese New Year, so spending may surprise on the upside,"" Pang said.
A spending surge would give a short-term boost to consumption, which has been flagging in recent months as the economy slowed. In December, retail sales rose 1.7% from a year earlier, the slowest monthly pace in 2021, according to official data.
Media worker, Pan Lei, 47, is among Beijing residents staying put and planning to splash out a little.
Instead of the usual trip to the southern city of Guangzhou to spend the holiday with his parents-in-law, he has booked a boutique hotel in the mountains to the west of Beijing at a cost of nearly 5,000 yuan ($788). 
""Normally, the price is less than 2,000 yuan but I've got no choice,"" he said. ""All hotels around Beijing are expensive during the holiday.""

""It's the Lunar New Year and I want the family to do something special and have fun together,"" he said.

Investing.com –  Chevron  stock (NYSE:CVX) slumped 4% Friday after it missed estimates for fourth-quarter earnings and then proceeded to give a disappointing outlook for this year's oil and gas production.
The company reported earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or $2.56 a share, short of the $3.10 estimate. On a sequential basis, earnings fell.
Analysts expected better after shortages in Europe and Asia pushed crude and gas prices to multi-year highs. Earlier this week, crude crossed $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Integrated energy companies such as Chevron and bigger rival Exxon (NYSE:XOM) with both upstream and downstream operations benefit the most in a booming market. But that wasn’t to be after slumping values for some long-held fields hurt its potential to take full advantage of surging prices. Chevron is the first major oil company to report its quarterly results. 
The company blamed the miss in earnings to the shrinking value of legacy assets including a stake in Northwest Shelf -- an Australian gas asset the company has been trying to sell since 2020. Royalties related to higher prices under certain international contracts and tax payments also hurt earnings, according to Chevron.
Chevron is projecting oil and gas production to be flat to 3% less this year due contract expirations in Indonesia and Thailand that it didn’t view as competitive.
Sales and other operating revenue climbed 85% to nearly $46 billion and beat estimates.  "

(Reuters) -European shares fell on Friday, with the STOXX 600 index down for the fourth straight week as auto and technology stocks led declines amid the prospect of higher interest rates and concern over the situation in Russia and Ukraine.
The pan-European index shed 1.0%, paring some losses after falling as much as 2% earlier in the day. The index lost 1.8% this week, marking its worst performance in over two months.
Euro zone bond yields rose following the hawkish message that emerged from the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting earlier this week.
""There's a whole lot to make investors nervous at the moment, and today seems to be the day European markets are really waking up to what the Fed's increasingly hawkish stance will mean for all that cash sloshing around,"" AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson said.
Russia on Friday sent its strongest signal so far that it is willing to engage with U.S. security proposals and reiterated that it does not want war over Ukraine.
""As we're approaching the weekend, a lot could happen in relation to the situation on the Ukrainian border and Russian troops,"" David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, said.
""The fear is that stock markets are closed for a 48-hour period, and what happens as tensions get ratcheted up in that timeframe is a huge deal.""
The top sectoral decliner, technology, fell 1.7%, tracking its worst month since 2008.
Adding to the gloom, euro zone economic sentiment deteriorated in January, pulled down by a more downbeat sentiment in the industry and services sectors.
Meanwhile, France posted its strongest growth in over five decades last year, hitting 7%, as the euro zone's second-biggest economy bounced back from the COVID-19 crisis faster than expected, data showed.
However, the German economy, Europe's largest, contracted more than expected in the fourth quarter of last year as pandemic-related restrictions hampered activity.
Auto stocks skidded 1.8%, with shares in Volvo falling 3.5% after the Swedish truck maker reported lower fourth-quarter core earnings and proposed a smaller-than-expected dividend.
Luxury goods maker LVMH rose 3.2% after saying quarterly sales growth accelerated, while Signify NV, the world's largest lighting maker, jumped 11.0% after reporting higher quarterly earnings.

Sweden's H&M gained 5.1% after the fashion retailer posted a bigger profit rise than expected for the September-November period.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 11:56AM ET</span>",Bargain hunters study stock valuations after big declines,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A steep slide in U.S. stocks has investors gauging equity valuations to determine whether now is the time to scoop up shares at a bargain. 
The S&P 500 has dropped over 9% so far in 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq stands in correction territory after a nearly 15% fall. The market sank again this week after the Federal Reserve signaled it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March before shrinking its balance sheet later in the year. 
Buying after pullbacks paid off for many investors over the last two years, when the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary policies during the pandemic buoyed stocks from one record high to the next. 
With the market now pricing in almost five rate hikes by the end of 2022, that calculus has changed dramatically. 
""The convergence of monetary and fiscal policy, which was historically dovish and ample, now is changing course and the equity markets as well as other risk markets are slowly coming to terms with that sobering reality,” said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. 
The slide in stocks has brought down the valuation of the overall S&P 500, which at the end of 2021 stood not far from its highest level in two decades. The index now trades at 19.5 forward 12 months earnings, compared to 22 times earnings in late December and its five-year average of 18.5, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
The market's fall hadn’t been precipitous enough for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists, who early this week declared in a note it was still ""too early to buy the dip."" An analysis of pre-pandemic equity valuations showed the index could decline another roughly 8% from the 4,410.13 level where it closed on Monday, Barclays strategists said in a report. The S&P 500 was recently at 4,330, about 2% below Monday's level. 
Other valuation metrics are more favorable to stocks. A look at the equity risk premium – or the extra return investors receive for holding stocks over risk-free government bonds – favors equities over the next year, according to Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. 
When that premium historically has been at the level it reached on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has beaten the one-year return for the 10-year Treasury note by an average of 11.8%, Lerner said. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has climbed about 30 basis points this year to 1.81% but remains low by historical standards. 
""At least right now, even though there could be more volatility, until and unless the Fed actually makes a mistake or there is actually a recession, you still want to stick with stocks over bonds,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. 
The strength of fourth-quarter corporate results, which continue to roll in with S&P 500 earnings season not yet at the halfway point, could bolster the case for investors looking to buy at a discount. 
With S&P 500 earnings expected to grow 8.4% in 2022, the backdrop for stocks appears to be a solid one. However, skittish investors have punished companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivering less than stellar news in recent weeks, adding to the uneasy mood. Another large batch of reports is due next week, including from heavyweights Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 

“Heading into 2022, our view was that equities could earn their way out of rising yields and lower P/E multiples. Our new base case for six hikes this year poses challenges to that bullish outlook,” analysts at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) wrote. 
Nevertheless, the bank said investors should “stay the course” in equities, as the “outlook for above-trend growth and inflation still translates to above consensus double-digit earnings growth for 2022.""

(Reuters) -Vans shoe maker VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) cut its full-year revenue forecast on Friday as it struggles with material shortages, labor issues at factories and slump in sales in China due to COVID-related lockdowns, sending its shares down over 6%. 
Fresh pandemic restrictions and store closures late last year in many Asian countries, including China, took a toll on many U.S. apparel makers that for years have relied on these countries for the bulk of their production and sales growth.
VF Corp said the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus was also impacting its sales across the world.
""The latest virus surge across Europe has contributed to declining consumer confidence, deteriorating traffic and stretched retail staff in our stores,"" VF Chief Financial Officer Matt Puckett said on an earnings call. 
Despite facing labor and raw material shortages, VF said it expected manufacturing to return to near full capacity in the coming weeks.
The company cut its fiscal 2022 revenue forecast to about $11.85 billion from $12 billion. It expects revenue for its ""Active"" unit, which houses the Vans and Supreme brands, to increase between 31% and 33%, compared with a prior range of 35% to 37% gain.

Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen initiated coverage on Marathon Digital with a buy rating and $51 price target. 
The analyst explained that even though the recent selloff in bitcoin ""moderates the revenue growth outlook,"" they still ""expect ~80% mining margins and a 12-18 month payback period on recent ASIC miner purchases.""
""We estimate that BTC will rise at a +32% CAGR through '24 and that MARA's revenue and EBITDA will rise at a +120% and +95% CAGR, respectively. As such, we view the miners as a better investment than BTC.""
MARA's shares are down 36% since the start of the year, but today's comments from Peterson have lifted them over 8% off their recent lows to around the $21.40 level. In November, they traded over the $80 mark.

Managers of big Italian companies, including power group  Enel  (MI:ENEI), the country's top two banks Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit and insurer Generali (MI:GASI), on Wednesday joined the virtual meeting with Putin, aimed at boosting business ties between the two countries.
The meeting sparked controversy amid a build up of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine, and went ahead despite a government official saying Rome had advised business leaders not to attend.
It was organised by the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce and by the Italian-Russian business committee chaired by tyremaker Pirelli Chief Executive Marco Tronchetti Provera.
Tronchetti Provera said on Friday the meeting had been planned since November and the fact that it took place against the backdrop of the Ukrainian crisis was entirely coincidental.
""Businesses have a duty to grow, safeguard their investments and workers abroad,"" he said after an event to celebrate Pirelli's 150th anniversary, adding business from other European countries were holding similar meetings with Putin.

Investing.com – HP stock (NYSE:HPQ) traded 1.6% higher Friday after a British judge ruled that it was short-changed when it bought Autonomy in 2011 for $11 billion.
Justice Robert Hildyard held Autonomy-owner Mike Lynch guilty of inflating the company’s books before selling it to HP.
According to Reuters, HP won the majority of its civil case against Lynch though the damages to be announced at a later date will be significantly smaller than the $5 billion demanded.
Giving his verdict on Friday, Judge Hildyard found that Lynch and his finance director Sushovan Hussain had concealed a ""fire sale"" of hardware and engaged in convoluted reselling schemes to mask a shortfall in sales of their company’s software, the business HP wanted to pivot itself away from hardware.
HP wrote down Autonomy’s value by $8.8 billion in 2012. It sued Lynch in 2015 and sold the remnants of its acquisition along with other assets to British company Micro Focus in 2016.

The change is the latest in a string of structural reshuffles for the carmaker that began its life as Daimler-Benz AG in 1926. The Mercedes brand, named after the daughter of an automobile entrepreneur, was officially adopted by Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG in 1902.
""We have a real chance to raise the multiple,"" CEO Ola Kaellenius told reporters on Friday, without naming a specific target valuation for the firm now worth just under 77 billion euros ($85.70 billion). 
Shares of Daimler Truck AG, spun off from the newly anointed Mercedes-Benz last December, have risen slightly since their market debut to trade at 32.23 euros on Friday. Mercedes-Benz shares, at their highest levels since 2015 in November 2021, reached 74.25 on the day of the split, but have trended slightly lower since to trade at 71.15 euros.
Still, a premium carmaker battling over the luxury market, by definition small and finite, could only grow so much, analysts said.
""Investors could start viewing Mercedes as a Lucid Motors or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) type and start to give it an EV (electric vehicle) multiple,"" European auto analyst at RBC Capital Markets Tom Narayan said.
""But Lucid and Tesla get to start at 100% EV. For Mercedes you have to convert your existing ICE (NYSE:ICE) (internal combustion engine) business to EVs. That may be a limitation on how far the multiple could go near-term.""

Daniel Schwarz, management director at Stifel, said valuations reflected the view that German brands were on the defensive, forced to protect their market share.
""Tesla's valuation is based on the assumption that Tesla will win market share from German manufacturers, who don't have a comparable revenue growth potential.""

Richard Bernstein, who heads Crystal Amber, predicted that a sale of De La Rue's authentication division alone would generate more than the company was worth following the stock's 25% slump on Monday, according to the report.
De La Rue's shares slumped 25% on Monday after the company delayed the delivery of its turnaround plan by a year and warned annual profit would miss market expectations, as it struggles with coronavirus-related staff absences and supply chain issues.
The activist investor, the third-largest shareholder in the company with about a 10% stake, said in a monthly report on Friday that the currency printing industry needed consolidation. 
It added that De La Rue would be the subject of a takeover bid from one or more competitors in the coming months.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Electrolux said on Friday global supply chain issues would persist after posting a drop in quarterly profit, while expecting demand in 2022 above pre-pandemic levels.
Households have been spending more on their homes, including on appliances, during the pandemic. But global logistics constraints and shortages of electronic components have hit Electrolux's production.
Electrolux said the issues would continue to impact the industry's ability to fully meet demand, while it expected prices to offset strong cost inflation in 2022, mainly in raw materials, electronic components and logistics.
""We estimate that the first quarter will be at least as challenging as the fourth quarter 2021,"" the Swedish company said in a statement, adding it expected sequential improvements from mid-2022.
Shares in Europe's biggest home appliances maker, down 14% so far this year through Thursday, fell 5.4% in early trade.
Kepler Cheuvreux said the ""reasonably good"" result was already evident from rival Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR)'s report earlier this week.
""The share is reacting on the weak guidance on Q1 as well as guidance on the very significant cost inflation for 2022E well above Whirlpool's guidance,"" said analyst Johan Eliason.
Electrolux had previously warned that global supply chain constraints would be challenging in the fourth quarter and into this year.
Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to 882 million Swedish crowns ($94.1 million) from a year-ago 2.50 billion, including costs of 727 million relating to arbitration in a U.S. tariff case.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) met this week with executives at top western banks and asset managers to reassure them about the country's economic prospects after regulatory crackdowns in 2021, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
CSRC Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai hosted the virtual meeting with more than a dozen foreign financial institutions on Tuesday, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Senior executives from firms including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Fidelity International, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UBS attended the meeting, said two of the sources.
Fang reassured the meeting participants that China will achieve ""respectable growth"" in 2022, one of the people said. 
Fang also said that China's leadership understood that the regulatory changes Beijing introduced in 2021 would affect economic growth but was determined to tolerate the pains, the person said.
However, 2022 will be different year as it will have a series of significant events, including the key once-in-five-years Communist Party congress later this year, Fang said, according to that person. 
The CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Fidelity and UBS declined to comment, while the other companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Chinese regulator called the meeting against the backdrop of a slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy amid its struggles with sporadic small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks and the darkening outlook for its heavily indebted property sector.
SLOWING ECONOMY
The economy grew by 4% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its weakest expansion in 1-1/2 years and China's central bank has already started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system in response.
The International Monetary Fund said in a report https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/imf-warns-unbalanced-china-recovery-policy-uncertainty-2022-01-28 on Friday that China's economic recovery was well advanced but imbalanced because of weak consumption, and also warned of uncertainty brought by regulatory crackdowns on the technology sector and slowing productivity.
Chinese regulators last year took aim at tech giants, private education companies and other firms, targeting unfair competition and data governance.
Such reforms could help growth but can damage market sentiment which in turn could dent investment, the IMF said.
The CSRC was also keen to hear from the meeting participants whether foreign financial institutions' asset allocation to China will change because of the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, said the person.
Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell unleashed bets on five or more hikes this year after he left the door open on Wednesday to raising rates faster than in previous cycles. 
Fang also told the executives that China and the United States were making progress in coordinating regulations governing Chinese companies listed in New York and there could be a ""positive surprise"" by June or earlier, the person said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last month that U.S.-listed Chinese companies must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity and provide evidence of their auditing inspections https://www.reuters.com/business/us-sec-mandates-foreign-companies-spell-out-ownership-structure-disclose-2021-12-02.

The deal is part of the Chinese government's push to buy assets from cash-strapped private developers, as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over a beleaguered sector that accounts for a quarter of its economy.
Shimao, which defaulted on a trust loan earlier this month, said it will sell an entity whose principal asset is the Hyatt on the Bund hotel to the Shanghai Land Group. 
The developer in 2022 has $1.7 billion maturities offshore and 8.9 billion yuan onshore, according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO).

The move comes on the same day Agile Group, another embattled Chinese property firm, sold stakes in several units worth nearly 2 billion yuan to state-owned China Overseas Land & Investment and China Conch Venture. Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property firms into a debt crisis, with sector bellwether China Evergrande grappling with $300 billion in liabilities.

Investing.com — Shares of streaming TV service Fubotv Inc (NYSE:FUBO) jumped 7.5% off recent lows to $9.53 after being upgraded by technology, media and telecommunications research firm LightShed Partners.
LightShed said in a research piece that it is upgrading Fubo to neutral from sell and removing its $6.50 target price, giving up on its call to short the stock. However, it isn't bullish on the stock and is merely waiting to see ""whether management abandons their sports betting 'fantasy' to reduce the cash burn.""
In the note, LightShed said it previously sold short the stock because Fubo was one of the best examples of the market craze during the meme stock rally last winter.
""With a market cap of nearly $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow negative through at least 2025 and cash likely to run out in 2023, FUBO could very well be a zero in the next 24 months,"" LightShed said.
""All that said, with Fubo stock down nearly 85% in 13 months and the company sitting on $375 million of cash, we are going to wait and see whether management abandons their sports betting ""fantasy"" to reduce the cash burn in 2022 and beyond,"" they added. "
1429,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 10:46AM ET</span>",Factbox-What did the judge find in Hewlett-Packard versus Lynch?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard won the majority of its civil case against British tech tycoon Mike Lynch over its acquisition of Autonomy in 2011, though damages will be considerably less than the $5 billion claimed.
Below are the findings given by High Court Justice Robert Hildyard on Friday.
TOPLINE:
""I have reached clear conclusions in these proceedings on the civil liability of Dr Lynch and Mr Hussain for fraud under FSMA [Financial Services and Markets Act 2000], common law, and the Misrepresentation Act 1967, applying, of course, the civil standard of proof of the balance of probabilities.""
HARDWARE SELLING
""The hardware reselling programme was conceived, expanded and implemented in order to enable Autonomy to cover shortfalls in software revenue by selling hardware and including the revenue without differentiation in revenue shown in the accounts as generated by Autonomy's software business.""
""The purpose of the hardware reselling strategy/programme was dishonest, and the way it was accounted for depended on its dishonest presentation.""
""The Defendants were well aware of this.""
USE OF RESELLERS
""The impugned VAR (reseller) transactions had no commercial substance. They were a means by which Autonomy could maintain the appearance of meeting revenue targets at the end of a quarter.""
""The purpose of the strategy was to ensure that Autonomy continued to appear to be a company which met its forecasts out of the sales of IDOL and related software and thereby maintained its share price.""
""(Lynch and Hussain) knew that the recognition of revenue on the sale to the VAR (reseller) was improper, and that the accounts were thus false.""
RECIPROCAL DEALS
Autonomy would buy a product from a customer or reseller that it did not need in return for them buying its software.
""I am satisfied that both Defendants knew that these reciprocal or round-trip transactions also were contrived with the dishonest purpose of artificially boosting apparent high margin software sales, with the effect of giving an exaggerated depiction of the success of Autonomy's core business.""
HOSTING DEALS
Customers, who were already making periodic payments to Autonomy for hosting its archive, would make a lump sum payment for what on the face of it looked like a software licence.
""Both Defendants were aware of the true nature of these lump sum arrangements and that they were driven by income recognition."" 
""They knew it gave a false impression to recognise the income immediately.""
OEM TRANSACTIONS
Autonomy categorised some revenue as sales to OEMs (original equipment manufacturer), which would incorporate Autonomy software into their products in return for paying a royalty. Such deals were highly valued by investors.

""A substantial proportion of the sales categorized as OEM sales (...) did not have this recurring nature, nor were they to OEMs. Instead, they were one-off sales to buyers.""
""I have found that both Defendants knew that the accounts and the representations they made in this regard gave a misleading picture of Autonomy's OEM business.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse is boosting cash payouts for senior bankers, it told employees on Friday, as it tries to retain top performers after a year of scandals saw its shares lose more than a quarter of their value.
The bank, which has been hit by a string of scandals and losses, is increasing the cash portion of short term bonuses senior staff receive and reducing the amount they get in shares that vest after one year, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
Across the financial industry, banker pay jumped in 2021 due to a bumper year for trading and dealmaking and firms are finding it harder to find and keep top performers. On Thursday,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said compensation at its investment bank rose 30% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank, meanwhile, faced an exodus https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-investment-bank-set-archegos-aftershocks-2021-07-27 of dealmakers and other senior bankers in 2021 after heavy losses prompted sackings, bonus cuts and an overhaul of its strategy and top management.
Now, in an unusual move,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is upping top earners' immediate cash payment, although they can only keep it if they stay with the firm for three years.
""For Managing Directors and Directors, this change is intended to rebalance the amount of immediate cash that is paid compared to prior years,"" executive managers told employees in the internal memo confirmed by the company.
Those receiving upfront cash would have to repay part of it if they left the bank within three years.
While clawback provisions - which often cover portions of bonuses composed of shares yet to vest - are typical in bankers' variable compensation and mean bonuses can be recouped if bankers are found to have violated certain rules, the move to recoup cash bonuses for leavers is unusual.
The new plan will not alter the proportion of bonuses covered by deferred compensation, which in the European Union and Britain must cover at least 40-60% of variable compensation, because longer term bonuses, which are paid in shares and vest after three years, will remain the same portion of the overall payout.
The changes apply to staff who earn more than $250,000.
Credit Suisse racked up a multibillion-dollar loss in 2021 on the default of a single investment banking client, while its asset management was hit by the collapse of $10 billion in funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill.
It has been trying to turn the page on a slew of negative headlines and reform its risk management culture, an effort set back by the abrupt departure this month of the chairman brought in just nine months earlier to lead that transformation.
On Tuesday, it warned it would report a fourth-quarter loss based on fresh legal costs and a slowdown in its trading and wealth management divisions.
With its new incentives scheme, Credit Suisse told employees it aimed to reinforce a culture ""based on personal accountability and responsibility"" that would better align compensation with ""positive behaviors"".

""With regards to executive compensation, Credit Suisse aims to strike an appropriate balance with the interests of shareholders and wider stakeholders,"" the bank said in a statement. ""We have also said that we will further align remuneration with our new strategic objectives, including our renewed focus on risk management.""
It introduced a one-time share plan for senior managers, which will vest in three years' time, but ""only if certain metrics tied to our strategic objectives are reached.""

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",Explainer-The regulatory and legal headwinds facing Robinhood,"By Chris Prentice and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets is still facing a number of legal and regulatory threats a year after the retail ""meme stock"" trading frenzy led the brokerage to restrict trading in some stocks, infuriating customers.
That episode sparked multiple government probes, a flurry of private lawsuits by aggrieved customers and investors, and intensified regulatory scrutiny of Robinhood's business model, all of which weighed on the company's share price.
""Robinhood operates in an industry that is highly regulated and subject to robust oversight,"" Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's chief legal and corporate affairs officer, said in a statement. 
""We have built industry-leading legal and compliance teams to help ensure that Robinhood remains the platform of choice for millions of investors,"" he added.
The company has also claimed some recent victories in court. Here are the latest developments: 
'MEME STOCK' PROBES, LAWSUITS
Regulators have issued subpoenas or sought testimony and information from the company and CEO Vladimir Tenev as part of investigations into trading restrictions the brokerage imposed during the meme-stock volatility a year ago, Robinhood disclosed in July and again in an updated October filing.
The regulators included the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the New York Attorney General's Office, other state attorneys general, Congress and some state securities regulators, Robinhood said at the time. 
Robinhood is also facing private lawsuits related to the meme stock volatility and its core business practices, such as payment-for-order flow (PFOF), whereby retail brokers route orders to wholesale market makers in return for payment.
The company has seen some success on that front. A federal judge on Thursday dismissed investors' claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. [L1N2U724N]
The same Miami judge previously dismissed another lawsuit accusing Robinhood and other brokerages of colluding with market maker Citadel Securities to prevent ""meme stocks"" from rising, allegations the companies deny. The plaintiffs have refiled the lawsuit. 
Another suit alleging Robinhood violated securities law amid the meme stock fracas is pending. 
OTHER INVESTIGATIONS, LEGAL RISKS
This month a FINRA arbiter said Robinhood owed just under $30,000 in damages to a user who sought compensation for alleged negligence, breach of contract and other issues related to the brokerage's trading restrictions of January 2021. It was the first such successful claim, after others were denied. Jorge Altamirano, the attorney for the Robinhood customer, said his firm has received ""an overwhelming outreach"" from others and is currently vetting legal claims.
Robinhood is also being probed by New York state's Department of Financial Services over anti-money laundering and cybersecurity issues.
In April 2021, the California Attorney General's Office issued a subpoena seeking documents about Robinhood's trading platform, business and operations, and the application of California's commodities regulations to the platform, the October filing says. 
The Massachusetts Securities Division (MSD) also sued Robinhood in December 2020 alleging unethical and dishonest conduct and failure to act in accordance with its fiduciary duty among other lapses. Robinhood has rejected the allegations and is fighting the suit. 
Both the SEC and FINRA have requested information from the firm about its now-defunct ""For You"" feature and ""other features displaying lists of securities to customers.""
Spokespeople for California's attorney general and FINRA declined to comment. The other agencies did not respond to requests for comment. Robinhood, which has said it is cooperating with the probes, declined to offer fresh details on them. 
NEW REGULATIONS
Due to the meme stock saga, the SEC is scrutinizing commission-free brokers' business practices, most notably PFOF. Transaction-based revenue accounts for more than 70% of Robinhood's revenue, the company said on Thursday.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has questioned whether brokers are incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently to boost their profits and has floated banning PFOF.

The agency is also examining the use of game-like features to encourage trading and other digital engagement practices.
New regulation in these areas could require ""significant changes to our business model,"" Robinhood has warned.

Investing.com — Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) shares rose 0.2% on Friday, a day after the biotech said it would sell a stake in its Bioepis joint venture.
The company said Thursday night it was selling the stake to Samsung Biologics for up to $2.3 billion.
Biogen has a 49.9% share in the joint venture. It initially invested in a 15% stake in Samsung Bioepis when it was established in 2012, with the company having the right to purchase up to 49.9%, which it exercised in June 2018.
Biogen is currently facing uncertainties surrounding its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm. Analysts at Needham and JPMorgan view the sale of its Bioepis stake favorably.  
Needham analyst, Ami Fadia, told investors in a note they ""believe the sale will give management the capital to pursue strategic alternatives including business development while divesting its stake in a business where it did not have any long term prospects for a reasonable return. 
""With uncertainty around Aduhelm, the company is under pressure to explore alternatives growth opportunities, and we see this as a positive step in that direction.""
Fadia reiterated a buy rating on Biogen and a $292 price target.
In addition to Needham, JPMorgan's Cory Kasimov said in a client note that the deal bolsters Biogen's balance sheet and provides added flexibility. However, the analyst warned that the bigger focus is still on the Alzheimer's outlook, with the ""obvious challenges"" facing Aduhelm."

LONDON (Reuters) - European technology stocks fell into bear territory on Friday and were on track for their biggest monthly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis amid worries the U.S. Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten its monetary policy.
Europe's tech sector, the darling of investors during the pandemic, has dropped 20% - the technical milestone which defines a bear market - from a 21-year high touched in November.
It was also on course for its worst month since September 2008, sliding more than 15% in January. (Graphic: European sectors in 2022, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpeznqagvr/European%20sectors%20in%202022.png)
European tech moved in January in tandem with the Nasdaq index in the United States, which also registered its worst month in more than 13 years.
Global tech stocks have been under pressure as investors have been more reluctant to pay hefty valuations for growth stocks amid rising yields as the Fed plans to raise interest rates and end its bond purchases in March to tame inflation.
Mounting tensions between Russia and the United States over Ukraine also pushed investors towards safer assets.
""Rising real yields and good economic growth should continue to support value over growth,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a research note.
So-called value stocks, which trade at comparatively cheap multiples of their fundamentals - including banks, autos and energy shares - grew in popularity this year, outperforming growth stocks by 13 percentage points in January. (Graphic: Europe value vs growth, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdpxoaddevx/Europe%20value%20vs%20growth.png)
A Deustche Bank survey found that half of the 500 investors who took part believed tech stocks valuations in the United States were in bubble territory.
But some investors see recent price weakness making tech stocks an attractive buy.
Jeremy Leung, portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management, said he bought the tech dip in January.
""We have been actually taking advantage of weakness also in large tech names,"" he said, adding that the tech pull back was an opportunity to buy stocks that had become too expensive throughout the pandemic.
Earnings are also expected to be supportive.
The estimated earnings growth rate for the STOXX 600 technology companies for the fourth quarter 2021 is expected to be almost 40% higher than a year earlier, for a total of 10.5 billion euros.
Switzerland's Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) International, for example, raised its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year, as offices started to re-equip for staff returning from working at home.
German business software group SAP said there was room to exceed the 2025 free cash flow target of around 8 billion euros ($8.92 billion).
Tech initial public offering activity is expected to remain strong into 2022, said Conor Moore, head of KPMG Private Enterprise, who tracks venture capital and tech IPOs.

""Will valuations be as high as it was in parts of 2021? Maybe not,"" he said. There will be ""a little bit of a slowdown but I don't think it's a dramatic slowdown,"" Moore added.

The companies, both of which provide labour-saving storage technology to the fast-growing online shopping industry, have been locked in a series of battles https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-autostore-ocado-lawsuit-idUSKBN26M5VO over intellectual property (IP) rights for years.
AutoStore shares initially rose 15% on Friday when the company said a Munich court had halted proceedings brought by Ocado to prevent the sale of one of AutoStore's robots in Germany.
But Ocado hit back by saying the Norwegian company had given a partial and misleading account of the proceedings and that the case was still to be concluded. AutoStore's shares had swung to a loss of 4.0% by 1405 GMT.
The Munich court told Reuters that while it shared AutoStore's concerns, the Norwegian firm had not accurately portrayed the court's views.
Specifically, a sentence in Autostore's statement that ""The court's view was that Ocado were trying to claim technology they had not invented"", was not correct, a spokesperson for the Munich court said.
The topic of invention or non-invention was not part of Thursday's hearing, the court spokesperson added.
AustoStore did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the court's view.
Ocado said the case would resume at a later time.
""The infringement action against AutoStore continues but must await confirmation of the validity of Ocado's Utility Model right, which will be considered by a different court as is standard in Germany,"" Ocado said.
Ocado's shares traded down 7.2% in London.

AutoStore last month suffered a legal setback https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ocado-wins-patent-infringement-trial-itc-against-autostore-2021-12-14 in the United States in a lawsuit of its own against Ocado. Another patent case between the two rivals is ongoing in Britain.
AutoStore, whose biggest owner is Japan's SoftBank, went public in October and its shares initially rose sharply. They have since fallen, partly as a result of the U.S. legal setback, and are down 51% from their November peak.

Investing.com – Mondelez stock (NASDAQ:MDLZ) fell 4.2% Friday after the Oreo cookie maker warned of continued struggles with labor shortages and more expensive raw materials.
""We have entered 2022 with low stocks, and we are working to rebuild inventory levels, which takes time in this environment,"" Reuters quoted Mondelez Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella as telling analysts in a call.
The maker of Cadbury and Toblerone chocolates expects 2022 cost inflation to be in the high single digits, while it hopes to offset that with price increases and steps aimed at increasing revenue.
It also warned of an 8-cent hit to its full-year adjusted earnings per share from foreign currency translation, adding it would cut net revenue growth by about 2.5%.
While the pandemic boosted demand for cookies and beverages, it also created a severe shortage of raw materials, that was made adverse by shortage of labor, congestion at ports and just about everything getting more expensive. In Mondelez’s case, a six-week strike of about 1,000 workers in August at its U.S. plants made matters worse. 
Quarterly revenue rose 5% to $7.7 billion, boosted by higher product prices and volumes. Adjusted profit per share of 72 cents, and like sales, was above estimates."

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit will continue to study potential mergers and acquisitions after deciding against a Russian deal due to geopolitical risks but won't stray from plans to return billions in capital to shareholders, Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said.
The Italian bank reported better-than-expected 2021 results on Friday, with revenue growing and costs in check, and said it would return 3.75 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to investors through dividends and share buybacks.
Orcel, the former investment banking chief at Swiss lender UBS who joined UniCredit in April, is betting on bold capital distribution targets to lift the bank's market value. 
UniCredit trades at a discount to rivals, making it harder to use its shares as currency in a merger, though they have outperformed since Orcel pledged to generate over 16 billion euros in capital by 2024 and return it to shareholders.
As of Thursday, UniCredit shares had climbed 19% since Dec.9, when Orcel unveiled his strategy, against a 9% rise in the broader European banking sector.
Orcel's track record as one of Europe's most experienced dealmakers has fuelled persistent speculation that he could pull off a merger deal, something his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier sought in vain to achieve.
""It's our job to review all the opportunities in all the markets where we are ... but the bar for M&A is high,"" Orcel said. ""We may enter data rooms, talk to others ... but those discussions do not mean at all that we're going to close.""
A deal would need to bring a high return on investment without jeopardising capital generation and distribution plans, meaning bolt-on transactions were more likely, he said.
COMMITTED TO TARGETS
""I've committed to certain targets in terms of profitability, risk profile, distribution in excess of 16 billion euros and sustainable distribution thereafter. Whatever we do in M&A you should not expect we could derail in any way from those targets,"" Orcel told reporters on a call.
He confirmed that UniCredit, which walked away from a rescue deal with the Italian state for rival Monte dei Paschi in October, had also dropped a potential bid for Russian state-owned Otkritie Bank amid escalating tensions over Ukraine. 
Following calls by regulators for lenders to be on alert, Orcel said UniCredit's existing Russian business was prepared to adjust to any sanctions, as it had done in the past.
UniCredit, which entered Russia in 2007 and now ranks as the country's 12th biggest bank, would have exchanged its local operation for a controlling stake in Otkritie, which the central bank is expected to privatise through a listing.
In this way, UniCredit would not have significantly increased its exposure to Russia, which accounts for less than 5% of the bank's equity, while boosting its position in the market and saving costs, Orcel said.
Reversing earlier gains, UniCredit shares were down 0.5% by 1433 GMT, while European banks had lost 1.6% amid a broader sell-off across stock markets.
'ORCEL EXPRESS'
UniCredit reported a 5% rise in 2021 revenue to 18 billion euros, ahead of its forecast for more than 16 billion. At 3.9 billion euros, underlying profit also surpassed a target of more than 3.7 billion.
""Onwards and upwards,"" Citi analysts said, adding that results showed the new group strategy was bearing fruit. ""All onboard the Orcel-Express for higher return.""
Overall costs were also lower than the bank's forecasts, despite rising variable pay for executives, and UniCredit reported a slightly higher-than-expected core capital ratio.
Restructuring costs and other charges linked to disposals of non-core assets under Orcel's 2022-2024 plan led to a 1.44 billion euro loss in the fourth quarter, worse than an average forecast of 1.15 billion in an analyst consensus from the bank.
UniCredit also said it had struck new insurance deals with Allianz (DE:ALVG), which gave it the chance to bring its Italian joint venture with the German insurer in-house in 2024, if capital rules on insurance holdings favoured such an option.
Orcel said, however, that he did not expect at present to exercise it, and would continue to work with Allianz after extending their Italian accord another five years to 2027.
Under the new agreement with Allianz, which owns 3.13% of UniCredit, the Italian lender will be able to distribute its own products through the insurer's digital platform. 

Orcel also said UniCredit would continue to streamline ""substantially"" its multiple insurance partners but it did not expect to go down to one.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower in choppy trading on Friday, with ongoing liquidations in many stocks contrasting with pockets of strength in companies with better short-term cash generation. 
The market was troubled by data showing that wage growth slowed the fourth quarter, while personal spending fell again in December as consumer prices continued to rise at a brisk clip. 
By 9:37 AM ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 252 points, or 0.7%, at 33,909 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.3%. The three indices have made an unconvincing start to the year, with declines of 6%, 9% and 15% respectively so far. 
Earlier, the day's dump of U.S. economic data showed that the latest wave of Covid-19 hit personal spending, which fell 0.6% in December, its biggest monthly drop since March. Personal income also grew by less than expected at 0.3%, rather than the forecast 0.5%.  At the same time, there was little sign of any easing in inflation pressures, with the index for core personal consumer expenditures - the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - rising by 0.5% for the third month in a row, bolstered not only by used car prices, but also by rents, healthcare and clothing costs. Core PCE prices rose 4.9% on the year.
There was a glimmer of hope however, in that the Employment Cost Index, a measure of wage and non-wage costs, rose by only 1.0% in the fourth quarter, down from 1.3% in the third quarter.  Even so, wage costs rose 4% across the economy last year, the fastest rate in over 20 years.
""The ECI data seem to indicate that while wages continue to grow briskly, the breakneck pace of the second and third quarters won't be sustained,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist with online employment agency Indeed, said via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock stood out from the crowd in early trade, rising 3.1% after reporting record sales in the holiday quarter and talking up its plans for the Metaverse. Payment card giants Visa and Mastercard also both rose after churning out egregious amounts of cash yet again in the fourth quarter. Higher card spending and the start of a rebound in travel supported both companies' profits. Visa (NYSE:V) stock rose 6.2% while Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock rose 2.2%.
However, Tesla stock continued to lose ground amid disappointment at the company's decision to put off new product launches until next year at the earliest. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 2.8% to a three-month low. 
A bigger loser was  Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock, which fell another 7.1% to a new record low after the company reported that its active user base shrank in the fourth quarter and issued revenue guidance for the current quarter that was also below expectations. The stock has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since it went public last July.

The investment company bought 33,482 Tesla shares on Thursday, worth nearly $28 mln based on the stock's last closing price, across its flagship ARK Innovation ETF and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF funds.
Shares of Tesla tumbled 11% to $829.10, their lowest close in three months, after the company delayed releasing new vehicles until next year because of supply chain disruptions it said could last through this year.
The fund began trimming its holding in the company in August 2021, according to daily trade notifications compiled by Cathie's Ark, a newsletter service and online forum that tracks the asset manager.
Tesla is still ARK Innovation's top holding but its weight in the ETF has dropped to 8% from 11.2% at the end of October, according to Refinitiv data.
Wood said in September that she has a five-year price target of $3,000 for the stock. Tesla was down 1.5% at $817 in premarket trading on Friday, having lost nearly a third of its value since hitting an all-time peak on Nov. 4.

The $11.48 billion ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar in 2020, but ranked among the worst performers of 2021 as rising interest rates weighed on the high-growth, high-valuation companies in its portfolio.
The other top holdings at ARK Innovation, including streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc, have slumped between 75% and 63% in the past 12 months.

According to Refinitiv data, investors offloaded U.S. equity funds worth $9.42 billion in the week - more than twice the amount it offloaded the previous week. (Graphic: Fund flows: US equities bonds and money market funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbklymapq/Fund%20flows%20US%20equities%20bonds%20and%20money%20market%20funds.jpg)
The S&P 500 slumped during the week, as a selloff in technology stocks ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting overshadowed upbeat results from blue-chip companies including  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and 3M.
In its latest policy update on Wednesday, the Fed indicated it was likely to raise rates in March, as widely expected, and reaffirmed plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings.

Investors sold U.S. municipal bond funds worth $1.61 billion, which was the biggest outflow since April 2020, while U.S. taxable bond funds posted outflows of $5.38 billion. However, U.S. general domestic taxable fixed income funds and loan participation funds obtained $2.89 billion and $2 billion.

Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker is arguably Wood’s highest conviction bet and the biggest holding of the ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK), which has plunged in January as investors dump expensive-looking and speculative tech bets. Yet until now, Tesla’s drag on the fund in 2022 had been modest.
That changed Thursday after Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings and outlook underwhelmed investors -- triggering a 12% drop in its shares. The move added almost a full percentage point to ARKK’s own decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The ETF closed down 3.9% as U.S. megacap stocks fell anew. 
ARKK has now slumped 30% this year, with Tesla accounting for about 1.74 percentage points of the decline -- up from 0.91 percentage point on Wednesday. As of Thursday it is the third-largest drag on the ETF in 2022, after  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc.
Wood’s oft-repeated mantra is that her firm ARK Investment Management invests with at least a five-year time horizon, and that volatility in their equity picks is expected. The firm frequently uses drawdowns to add to its favorite holdings.
It has also trimmed winning positions when they threatened to become too big. This has included generally keeping Tesla below 10% of ARKK.
The ETF fluctuated between gains and losses in early trading on Friday before dropping 1.7% as of 8:04 a.m. in New York. Tesla fell 1.1%.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 09:16AM ET</span>",H&M looks beyond pandemic with drive to double sales by 2030,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish fashion group H&M drew a line under the pandemic on Friday, reporting a bigger than expected jump in quarterly profit and hiking investments with the aim of doubling sales by 2030. 
Shares in the world's second-biggest clothing retailer leapt 5% in early trade after it said it would double investments in 2022 to around 10 billion Swedish crowns ($1.1 billion) to help achieve its new target.
Spending will focus on areas including technology, the supply chain, renewable energy and sustainable materials, it said.
""We ended the year strongly, with sales back at the same level as before the pandemic and with profitability better than it has been for several years,"" CEO Helena Helmersson said. 
""Now that we are back to a more normalised situation with a strong financial position and good profitability, we can fully focus on growth again."" 
Pretax profit in September-November - H&M's fiscal fourth quarter - leapt 64% from a year earlier to 6.00 billion crowns ($640 million). Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 5.43 billion crown profit.
""The strong result for the quarter is mainly a result of well-received collections with more full-price sales, lower mark-downs and good cost control,"" H&M said in a statement.
It said initiatives in recent years in technology and in making its supply chain more efficient mitigated the effects of disruptions in product supply.
Compared with the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019, profit was up 43%.
H&M, like its biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, is bouncing back from the pandemic despite supply chain challenges.
The Swedish group proposed an ordinary dividend of 6.50 crowns per share to be paid in two instalments, as well as a 3 billion crown share buy-back programme. 
H&M said it now aimed to double sales by 2030 compared with 2021 sales while at the same time halve its carbon footprint, and to reach an operating margin above 10% by 2024.
In 2021, sales totalled 199 billion crowns and the operating margin was 7.7%. Pretax profit totalled 14.3 billion crowns, against analysts' mean forecast of 13.5 billion.

To help lower its carbon impact, H&M said it would no longer take supplies that use coal-based fuels.

Investing.com –  Caterpillar  stock (NYSE:CAT) was 2.3% down in premarket trading Friday as the company warned of a hit to its margins in the first quarter, even as sales surge.
The statement comes after the company battled labor shortages, material cost inflation and supply chain disruptions in the December quarter. Higher costs, including for freight, cost Caterpillar 1.4 percentage points in operating profit margin, which fell to 11.4%.
The company expects the margins to improve as the year progresses and supply chains ease. 
According to Reuters, Caterpillar expects to raise prices again this year, after two such increases already last year.  
Sales in the fourth quarter rose 23% to nearly $14 billion, riding on higher volumes and price realization in both North and Latin America.
Demand was lower in Asia Pacific, mainly because of China, where the debt crisis hitting real estate developers is causing fixed asset investment - and consequently the demand for heavy machinery - to slow sharply.   
Profit was $2.12 billion in the quarter, and at $2.69 per share on an adjusted basis, beat estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department on Friday said it was opening a $1.5 billion grant program for a wide range of infrastructure projects.
In November, the department awarded 90 projects in 47 states a total of $1 billion.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the funds will ""support more projects than ever, and help make our transportation system safer, more accessible, and more sustainable for people across the country.""
Under the $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden, the Transportation Department will receive $660 billion over five years, including $210.5 billion to be awarded in competitive grants. Of that $71 billion is for new grant programs.
Biden has made rebuilding U.S. infrastructure a key part of his domestic agenda.
The department will evaluate proposals on safety, environmental sustainability, quality of life, economic competitiveness, state of good repair, partnership and innovation, mobility and community connectivity.
Buttigieg will be in Kansas Friday to discuss the new grant program.
Environmental groups like the Sierra Club say the U.S. must do more than just rebuild existing roads and bridges but must also reduce the number of single-passenger vehicles and dramatically improve public transit.
The grants awarded under the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) last year went to rebuild roads and add rail lines — and to create new green space, trails, bike lanes and safer streets for pedestrians as well as dedicated bus lanes and dock replacements.
Seattle received $20 million to reconstruct a 1.1-mile road segment and add a bike lane. Washington County, Oregon received $12.2 million for a 15-mile trail.

Charlotte, North Carolina received $15 million to construct a new multimodal transit center and New Orleans won $18.5 million to improve transit fare collection.
Applications for the new grants are due by April, with awards to be announced by August.

Investing.com – Visa stock (NYSE:V) traded 4% higher in premarket Friday as strong growth in ecommerce and an uptick in international travel helped the company drive past first-quarter estimates.
Payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth all accelerated on a year-on-year basis, the company said.
Visa processed nearly 48 billion transactions in the quarter through December, a 21% increase. The company said recovery in international travel was better than expected and said it doesn’t expect the current surge in Covid cases to curtail that.

In the week that pushed the S&P 500 Index to the verge of a correction, stock funds absorbed billions of cash. 
There’s “zero capitulation in equity positioning,”  Bank of America. strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note on Friday. The strategists, who track EPFR Global data, said equity mutual funds and exchange-traded products took in $17.1 billion in the week to Jan. 26. 
While it may sound counterintuitive that stocks can go down when fund flows are going up, it’s only a small part of what’s happening in the market, compared with flows in derivatives. Investors mainly track the data as a gauge of market sentiment. 
It shows that despite the deep losses in tech stocks, there’s still an appetite for risk among the retail crowd. Stock funds have absorbed $84 billion this year and just two out of the 18 trading days have seen outflows, the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists said. 
In the report on Friday, Hartnett described the recent market action as “sell hubris, buy humiliation” in reference to the severe losses in industries like clean energy, social media, crypto and innovation. 
The flows data doesn’t entirely show that investors are without fear. Investors increased cash holdings by $14.9 billion, Bank of America wrote. 
Bond funds, which have come under pressure as yields rise, recorded the biggest weekly outflow since March 2021, losing $10.2 billion. High-yield corporate bonds saw the largest outflows since September 2020.
One bright spot: emerging market stocks. The group had their largest inflow in almost a year.

PARIS (Reuters) - Orange on Friday named Christel Heydemann its new chief executive, making her the first woman to lead France's biggest telecoms operator amid a revamp of its governance.
A former graduate of France's elite engineering school Polytechnique, 47-year-old Heydemann will replace Stephane Richard from April 4 at the helm of the state-controlled group after a court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds.
Richard, who has led Orange for the past 12 years, denies any wrongdoing.
Heydemann becomes the third woman appointed to lead a company listed on the French CAC 40 index, after Engie's Catherine MacGregor and Estelle Brachlianoff, who is set to take the reins of utility group Veolia on July 1. 
She comes from Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), where she led European operations for the French electric equipment group. 
Heydemann said that, as an Orange board member for nearly five years, she had gained a ""solid understanding of the technological challenges"" facing Orange.
""It is equally a huge honour to be able to contribute to the development of one of the leading players in our industry,"" she said in a statement.
Richard was initially slated to quit the telecoms group on Monday, but Orange's board voted to maintain him as chairman until the company' shareholder meeting on May 19 at the latest. He will also continue to run operations until April 4.
Richard is also to be replaced as non-executive chairman of the group, as the group is also splitting the roles CEO and chairman of the board. 
""Very happy to welcome Christel Heydemann, future CEO of Orange. A woman with professional and human qualities that will allow her to meet the group's challenges with the help of our main wealth: our teams worldwide,"" Richard tweeted on Friday.

Shares in Orange were trading up 0.11% at 1131 GMT. 
Heydemann will take the reins of the company as it keeps on deploying the new generation of internet mobile networks and broadband fibre optic infrastructure - capital-heavy investments that have pressured its margins as its two biggest markets, France and Spain, remain highly competitive.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 07:17AM ET</span>",India's Ather targets 1 million electric scooters a year as demand soars,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ather Energy, India's top electric scooter maker by revenue, is raising funds to ramp up annual production to one million scooters over the next three years amid a surge in demand, the startup's co-founder and chief executive told Reuters.
Ather, which counts Tiger Global and Indian bikemaker Hero MotoCorp as investors, has raised about 12 billion rupees ($160 million) since its inception in 2013 and is in the process of raising more, Tarun Mehta said in an interview. 
""Our plan was to not raise more capital and focus on growing the brand, but the rate of transition to electric and the pace at which the supply chain and capacities need to ramp is way faster than what we thought a year back,"" Mehta said.
He declined to comment on the amount the company plans to raise. A source with knowledge of the plans said Ather was looking for about $133 million. Of this, it has already raised $56 million from Hero. 
Sales of electric scooters surged more than five-fold in India last year, as high fuel prices push buyers to look for alternatives and government subsidies narrow the price gap between electric and gasoline models. 
Even so, electric models made up just 1% of total Indian motorcycle and scooter sales of 14.5 million in 2021. The government wants this to reach 40% by 2030 as it looks to reduce its oil import bill and curb pollution.
Ather is also building its war chest amid rising competition from startups like Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed Ola Electric, which recently raised $200 million, as well as from India's traditional bikemakers like Hero, Bajaj Auto and TVS, which are speeding up their clean mobility plans. 
Over the next three years, Ather plans to increase its annual production capacity to one million scooters from 400,000 by the end of 2022, install 5,000 fast chargers across India, develop new products and increase its network to 600 stores, Mehta said.
The biggest challenge he sees is growing the supply chain and convincing suppliers to invest ahead of time in electronic components like motors and controllers for India's nascent electric vehicle market.
The required investment and pace of expansion will also push back Ather's profitability, which Mehta expects is now another two years away. 
""The demand is massive, and the Indian market has been supply constrained,"" he said. 
Ather currently manufactures about 5,000 electric scooters a month and builds its own lithium-ion battery pack. Mehta expects to expand production to 20,000 scooters a month in 2022, helped by a surge in demand from smaller cities.

His longer term vision is to invest in businesses that help increase the use of clean energy. 
""The next thing that excites me is trucks and buses - it is low volume but massive energy consumption,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperforming after strong quarterly sales numbers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 130 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 9 points, or 0.1%.
Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, posted record sales over the important holiday quarter, using its heft with vendors to handle supply chain challenges, factory shutdowns and shipping delays better than most competitors.
The iPhone maker’s revenue rose 11% year-on-year to almost $124 billion in the fourth quarter, according to data released after the close Thursday, with revenue from services, seen as the key to its future growth, jumping 24% to top $19 billion.
However, the major indices on Wall Street have seen selling of late amid worries over the expected pace of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve as the U.S. central bank looks to bring down soaring inflation.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed marginally lower Thursday, its ninth losing day in 10. The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, and is down 1.6% week to date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%, on track for its fifth negative week on the trot.
These losses have arrived despite another solid quarterly earning season, with nearly 80% of the 145 S&P 500 companies that have reported to date topping expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.
With the intentions of the Federal Reserve at the forefront of investors’ minds, there will be a lot of focus on the release of consumer spending, income and the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the PCE, later in the session. The Michigan consumer sentiment surveys are also due for release.
Aside from Apple, other companies that are likely to be in focus later Friday are oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), heavy equipment manufacturer  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and consumer products conglomerate Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), which are scheduled to release quarterly earnings. 
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, on course for their sixth consecutive weekly gain, with the market remaining concerned over supply levels ahead of the latest meeting of top producers.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is expected to stick with its plan to increase output in a cautious manner in March when it meets next week.
The Baker Hughes’ drilling rig count and the CFTC’s positioning data round off the week later in the session.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $87.30 a barrel, having climbed to a seven-year high of $88.54 on Thursday, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $88.83, just off the previous session’s peak, which was the highest since October 2014.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa)'s head of renewable energies Elisabeth Brinton has stepped down less than two years after taking the reins of the business which the company seeks to rapidly grow as part of its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Brinton, who joined Shell in 2018, said in a LinkedIn post that she was leaving Shell for a new role, but not with a competitor. She became head of renewables and energy solutions in April 2020, replacing Shell veteran Mark Gainsborough.
A Shell spokesperson on Friday confirmed her departure.
Following Brinton's departure, starting Feb.1, Shell will create two new positions in the renewables leadership, the company said.
Thomas Brostrøm, currently senior vice president for renewables, will be appointed head of renewable generation. 
Steve Hill, currently executive vice president for Shell Energy, will be appointed head of energy marketing. Both roles will report into Wael Sawan, head of integrated gas and energy solutions.
Brostrøm joined Shell in August 2021 after heading the North America offshore business for Danish firm Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), the world's biggest offshore wind company.
On Thursday, BP (NYSE:BP) said it had hired an executive from Orsted to head a new offshore wind division as the British company restructures its renewable businesses. 
Shell has rapidly expanded its renewables projects under Brinton. Earlier this month, it was awarded together with partners a number of offshore wind licences in the British North Sea with capacity of around 5 gigawatt. It has also made a number of solar acquisitions in recent months.

Shell aims to become a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company by 2050. It aims to grow its spending on renewables and low-carbon energy to $2 to $3 billion per year in the near term, roughly 10% to 15% of its overall spending budget.

Investing.com – Robinhood stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) tumbled more than 14% in premarket trading Friday as the fourth-quarter numbers dealt a rude jolt to one of the key players of the 2021 meme stock rally.
Several metrics deteriorated for the trading platform in the December quarter: the net loss widened by a factor of over 30 to $423 million. On a sequential basis, monthly active users fell 8% to come in at just over 17 million. Average revenue per user plunged as much as 39% to $64 because of lower trading volumes in options and equities. Market rates earned on loaned securities declined and that hit the company too.
The company’s projection for revenue in the current quarter, at less than $340 million, also disappointed. This will be 35% lower year-on-year against a tough comparison quarter which included the peak of the 'meme' stock boom.  That frenzy is now waning.
Robinhood said it expects operating expenses to rise 15%-20% this year, excluding compensation costs. It had risen 266% in 2021.
Total net revenues for the quarter increased 14% to $363 million. Of this, transaction-based revenue was $235 million, rising 12%. Revenue from crypto trading climbed more than four-fold to $48.
Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick told Bloomberg Robinhood plans to cut its dependence on transaction revenue over the next two years. The launch of new products is key, he added.
According to Bloomberg, the company will add tax-advantaged retirement accounts, likely by midyear. Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said he hopes to launch fully-paid lending in the first half of the year as well.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 06:40AM ET</span>","Apple makes easy escape from supply crisis, but others may have to wait","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s triumph over the global chips supply-chain shortage has signaled good news amid troubled markets around the world.
Not so fast, say analysts. 
The iPhone maker, which had warned three months ago that supply issues would dent its holiday-quarter revenue, on Thursday posted record results largely boosted by sales of its premium phones. It sees an improving situation, if some remaining shortages.
""Most of the supply-constrained issues are over for Apple, but not necessarily for everybody else,"" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. 
Companies from electric automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to wafer fabrication equipment supplier Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) have warned again that supply chain issues, which crippled several industries, would continue to limit production this year. 
Semiconductor companies tend to give priority to bigger players such as Apple, for its massive buying power, huge demand for its products, and the company's ability to place custom orders for components used in its products. And Apple's high-end chips are costly, an attraction for the chip makers.
This essentially means Apple has an advantage and can procure components relatively faster than rivals. 
Still, while Apple got better service for more sophisticated chips, like many others, it faced troubles with some of the older technology chips, Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Lou Miscioscia said. 
Chips used in Apple iPads, which saw a 14% drop in revenue, use chips with older technology, and supplies of those older chips were particularly tight, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts.
Cook said the constraints on the older chips, or nodes, were very significant in the holiday quarter. ""Overall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints going down versus what they were in the December quarter,"" he said.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk this week said supply chain woes would limit manufacturing output in all company factories. ""So the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue,"" he told analysts.
Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research noted new supply challenges, with the Omicron surge adding more disruption to freight and logistics operations. The company said it was seeing scarcity of certain components and parts, including semiconductors, a few weeks into 2022. 

Analysts and market leaders in the semiconductor space held out hopes that supply issues would ease later this year. 
""That's going to remain a concern for the industry, but Apple may be the exception to the rule,"" said Romeo Alvarez, technology analyst at William O'Neil + Co.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",Real U.S. yields in biggest monthly jump since 2013 taper tantrum,"By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - U.S. real bond yields, borrowing costs stripping out inflation, will end January with their biggest monthly rise in almost a decade, highlighting the scale of turnaround in markets preparing for the Fed's stimulus rollback campaign. 
Essentially representing the real cost of capital, inflation-adjusted yields are critical for investors who charged into riskier assets such as stocks and corporate bonds during the years when real yields languished near record lows. 
The recent yield shock therefore has been a key driver of this month's 9% rout on Wall Street. 
The world's most-traded inflation-linked bond, the 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS), saw yields rise 50 basis points in January, the biggest move since June 2013, just after then-Fed boss Ben Bernanke ignited a selloff by flagging policy tightening.
They stand now around -0.6% compared with around -1.20% in November. 
Five-year TIPS yields rose an even more, up nearly 60 bps for their biggest monthly rise since October 2008. 
Real yields gained further momentum after the Federal Reserve signalled at the start of the month it may tighten policy faster than earlier expected, which may also include shrinking its $8 trillion-plus balance sheet. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounding more hawkish than expected at Wednesday's policy meeting caused sharp swings this week. 
""I'm not surprised real yields have led the way,"" said Paul Rayner, head of alpha strategy at Royal London Asset Management. 
""That combination of, maybe inflation reaching the peak, with central banks becoming more hawkish, you would expect real yields to bear the brunt of the pain initially."" (Graphic: TIPS yields monthly change, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbklynjvq/tips%20monthly%20change%20jan%2028.png) 
Real yields have led this month's broader bond selloff; their larger rise relative to nominal yields means breakevens - a proxy for markets' inflation expectations - have fallen. 
Ten-year breakevens, the gap between nominal and real yields often seen as a market gauge of inflation expectations, are down nearly 20 bps in January to around 2.4%. 
That, ING Bank reckons, is no longer elevated, as they discount expected inflation expectations just over 2% - the Fed's target - plus a slight premium. 
Royal London is underweight inflation markets for the first time in around two years, Rayner said.
Whether or not inflation becomes more permanent will determine where real yields move from here and if inflation proved more stubborn than expected, nominal bonds rather than TIPS would lead future selloffs, he said. (Graphic: U.S. 10y real yield vs breakeven, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwxkmopo/breakeven%20vs%20real%20yield%20jan%2028.png) 
European moves are less eye-popping; with interest rates unlikely to rise this year, German real yields have risen 17 bps in January.
The key question is how much more real yields might move.

Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), said it was the speed of the January moves that unnerved markets. He expects 10-year real yields around 0% by year-end, a 50 bps rise from current levels.
""If that's a gradual move higher, equity markets and the credit markets can stabilize, given... how improved (economic) fundamentals are,"" he added.

The carmaker said sales were 10.5 million vehicles in 2021, including those by affiliates Daihatsu Motors and Hino Motors.

Carmakers have been forced to cut output because a shortage of semiconductors during the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supply chains, boosting competition for the key component among makers of consumer electronic devices.

However, the Japanese company has weathered the pandemic better than most other carmakers because its home market, Japan, and parts of Asia, have been less affected than Europe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The mood has shifted dramatically a year since a spectacular rally in shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) captivated Wall Street, launching a mania for so-called meme stocks and putting the spotlight on retail investors as a force to be reckoned with in markets.
GameStop shares have tumbled from their peak, though they are far above levels touched before the meme stock craze. Other stocks popular with retail investors, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, have followed a similar path. 
It's not only meme stocks that have lost their luster. Individual investors and professional money managers alike now have to contend with a hawkish Federal Reserve, with expectations of tighter monetary policy battering assets that soared over the last two years and stirring volatility in broader markets. (Graphic: The boom and the bust, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykmemavg/Pasted%20image%201643217673693.png) 
BOOM AND THE BUST
Despite sharp drops from their 2021 peaks, several of the stocks caught up in the meme-stock trading frenzy are trading higher then they were at the start of 2021. AMC and GameStop remain up about 600% and 400%, respectively, from their Dec 31, 2020 closing levels. Some, like BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) show a more modest gain of 14%. 
Others haven't fared as well. Clover Health, for instance, which at one point in 2021 was up 72% for the year, is now trading 86% below its 2021 starting level. (Graphic: Meme stock mayhem, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwpkrzydavm/chart.png) 
MEME STOCK MAYHEM
In many cases, those who arrived at the meme stock party early and were quick to take profits were rewarded, while late-comers were punished. Most of the stocks swept up in the 2021 trading frenzy now stand anywhere between 70% to 95% below their recent highs. (Graphic: Single stock options, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbklnodpq/chart.png) 
OPTIONS 
Options have been a popular tool for investors looking to play the rally and their heavy usage helped exacerbate the swings in some stocks. 
Heightening their appeal among individual investors was the growth of commissions-free options trading on platforms such as RobinHood and Webull. 
Single stock options have been especially popular. Trading in these contracts on individual stocks jumped to a record high, at one point making up as much as 70% of the overall volume in options markets. 
Single stock options' overall market share has fallen to about 60% but remains higher than pre-2021 levels, suggesting that interest in options plays among retail investors remains robust. (Graphic: Short interest, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomjwlypd/Pasted%20image%201643231561840.png) 
SHORT WORK 
A year ago, retail investors rallied to squeeze hedge funds that had bet against shares of GameStop and other companies, bruising institutional players such as Melvin Capital in the process. 
But while the surges in GameStop and other meme stocks made some bears skittish, the practice of shorting stocks – or selling borrowed shares in the hopes of buying them back at a cheaper price – remains a popular strategy in markets.
""Short interest in some stocks has decreased rapidly as short-sellers exit positions to ensure that they are not caught out in the next GameStop event,"" said Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of financial analytics firm Ortex. 
""However ... this does not seem to have resulted in a significant effect as the overall short interest in all U.S.-listed stocks is currently 30% higher than it was a year ago, demonstrating the willingness to short stocks is still high,"" he said. (Graphic: WallStreetBets, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnejdqlpl/Pasted%20image%201643225852296.png) 
WALLSTREETBETS 
Reddit's WallStreetBets, the forum where individual investors exhorted each other to defy hedge funds and coordinated their stock buying, saw its membership swell in the wake of last year's meme stock drama, though engagement remains well below the peaks of early 2021.
The forum boasts around 11.5 million subscribers, up from 1.7 million in December 2020, while daily posts have fallen to under 1,000 from a high of about 64,000 a year ago. 

That doesn't mean that retail investors have dropped out of the market, even as volatility has rocked asset prices.
Individual investors bought a net of $1.66 billion in equities on Wednesday, when a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve outcome caused wild gyrations in markets, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) showed. That was the highest figure since a net $2.2 billion bought on November 30.

Investing.com – LVMH stock (PA:LVMH) gave up most of the gains in Paris trading Friday but was still up 1% as the French luxury goods retailer projected strong demand for its handbags, watches and jewelry.
The shares rose as much as 5.8% in early trading.
The bullish outlook follows strong fourth-quarter numbers at LVMH that saw shoppers return in large numbers to buy its marquee brands like Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Christian Dior and Tiffany.
Revenue for the group topped 20 billion euro ($22 billion) in 2021, rising 27% with some of its largest segments managing the biggest growth.
LVMH's largest division -- fashion and leather goods – grew as much as 28% year-on-year and was second only to the 30% growth notched by selective retailing which includes Sephora. Selective retailing, along with perfumes and cosmetics, are the only two categories whose sales are still below 2019 levels. Notwithstanding that, Christion Dior perfumes and couture had a strong quarter, the company said.
This was the first time the group consolidated its 2020 acquisition of Tiffany in its numbers.
Wines and spirits, the group’s smallest business, grew the least at 18%. Growth in this business rebounded most strongly in U.S. and China, the company said.
LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault said LVMH could increase prices to protect margins in the current inflationary environment. However, he warned that international travel - which has been a big supporter of sales in the past - may not return before next year or 2024.
LVMH counts tourists from China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia as some of its biggest customers. Last year's numbers suggest that those buyers found way to satisfy their demand for luxury without actually visiting LVMH stores in the likes of Paris and New York.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's market regulator has fined a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) subsidiary HK$348.25 million ($45 million) for misconduct in its cash equities business and is launching disciplinary proceedings against some former senior managers at the bank. 
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said on Friday that some of Citigroup Global Markets Asia Limited's (CGMAL) trading desks had issued inaccurate ""indications of interest"" in stocks to generate client inquiries and had also made misrepresentations to customers when executing some trades. 
The SFC said senior CGMAL managers had attended a roundtable with the watchdog in 2014 during which it drew attention to common deficiencies found in the market, and that it had also issued a circular in 2018 providing further guidance. 
Despite both these efforts, CGMAL had still failed to identify the misconduct or rectify its failures, the SFC said. 
It said it would, in due course, start disciplinary proceedings against the former members of the bank's senior management it considered responsible for CGMAL's misconduct. It did not say how many people were involved nor name them.
Reuters reported in 2019 that Citi had fired eight bankers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup-asia-idUSKCN1R40AE and suspended three from its equities trading desk in Hong Kong after an internal investigation revealed misconduct in their dealings with clients.

A Citi spokesman said the bank had held more than 400 client conversations to keep them informed, rebuild relationships and describe the enhanced controls adopted by Citi. He said most, if not all, had resumed their business relationship with Citi. 

""This resolves an issue relating to Citigroup Global Markets Asia Limited activities dating back to 2018. We have fully cooperated with the SFC's investigation and have implemented significant remedial measures to strengthen our compliance and internal controls,"" he said in an emailed statement.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>",SoftBank COO Marcelo Claure exits; departure sparked by pay dispute -source,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Anirban Sen and Sam Nussey
(Reuters) -Japan's SoftBank Group Corp on Friday said its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, is leaving the technology investor, in the latest blow after a string of high-profile departures.
The exit comes after a fallout with founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son over his pay, a person familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.
Claure's deputy, Michel Combes - a French former telecoms executive - has been appointed chief executive of SoftBank Group International, SoftBank said. 
Claure, who was already one of the highest-paid executives at the tech giant after earning a pay package of $17 million in 2020, has been in talks to leave SoftBank for several months and may soon launch his own investment firm, earlier media reports indicated. 
While Son has been unabashed about his willingness to pay to attract foreign talent, he heads a publicly listed Japanese company in a country where large payouts to top management are frowned upon by investors.
Claure, who has spent several years inside SoftBank cleaning up messy investments such as wireless carrier Sprint and office-sharing company WeWork, had expected to be paid billions of dollars in compensation over the years, while Son was looking to pay him a much smaller sum, the person said.
Son had discussed a potential structure that could have allowed Claure to be paid much more than his existing pay package, but he never committed to it in writing, resulting in a clash with Claure that led to his decision to resign imminently, the person said.
SoftBank and Claure did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.
The departure of Claure, one of the SoftBank's top decision makers along with Vision Fund head Rajeev Misra, underscores the uncertainty over who might succeed the 64-year-old Son. 
Tokyo listed with a large retail investor base and a stake in telco SoftBank Corp but primarily focused on tech investing through its Vision Fund unit. With offices in London and California, SoftBank revolves around the personality of Son.
Nikesh Arora, a former top executive at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), joined SoftBank in 2014 to eventually succeed Son but left in 2016 after Son decided to continue running SoftBank.
""The impact on SoftBank's overall outlook is limited considering Claure largely works outside Vision Fund,"" said analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Holdings.
""They will miss his expertise on Latam investments and as a U.S.-based fixer but the latter is hard to quantify,"" Boodry said. 
While framed by Son's soaring rhetoric about the group's mission to create ""happiness for everyone"", SoftBank has become known for its thrusting deal making and workplace politics as its investors scramble for position.
Claure's exit adds to a string of top-level departures from SoftBank over the past few years including Deep Nishar and Jeff Housenbold from the Vision Fund, with the latter leaving for compensation reasons. 
The group's chief strategy officer, Katsunori Sago, who was also seen as a possible successor, left last year. 
Bolivian-born billionaire Claure rose through the ranks at SoftBank after the Japanese conglomerate's 2014 purchase of his company Brightstar, going on to become the top boss of Sprint which eventually merged with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc.

Claure also launched SoftBank's first $5 billion Latin American fund in 2019, at a time when no deep-pocketed investor had signed big checks for startups in the region.
He runs the Bolivian football team Club Bolivar and serves as the executive chairman of WeWork.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded nearly 5% higher in premarket Friday after the company defied supply shortages to post record quarterly revenue that beat all estimates.
The company’s revenue rose 11% year-on-year to almost $124 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 25 as sales of iPhones and most of its other devices soared. Revenue from services, seen as the key to its future growth, jumped 24% to top $19 billion.
Sales of iPhones jumped more than 9% to near $72 billion, their share in the total product revenue of over $104 billion remaining unchanged around 69%. The company was the biggest seller of smartphones in China in December quarter, according to Counterpoint.
The world’s most valuable company has used its heft with vendors to handle supply chain challenges, factory shutdowns and shipping delays the best among competitors. Those troubles cost Apple about $6 billion in lost sales in its fourth quarter. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters those shortages are now easing.
Another factor boosting the stock is the company talking about its metaverse plans Thursday. The company has 14,000 AR apps on its app store, and according to Reuters, CEO Tim Cook expects the number to go up. Cook said Apple's research and development efforts are focused on the intersection of hardware, software and services.
The impact of chip shortages was most visible on sales of iPads, the lone product in the Apple portfolio to have seen an erosion. Sales of the device fell 14% to $7.3 billion. Reports had earlier said that the company was diverting chips meant for iPads to iPhones. 
Mac sales jumped 25% while those of wearable, home and accessories – another emerging focus area for Apple – were higher by over 13%.
Away from the earnings report, Thursday also saw the attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia throw their weight behind Epic Games, the publisher of 'Fortnite', in its antitrust fight against Apple. The states appealed against a ruling that dismissed most of Epic's complaints that Apple's app store fees and other practises were anti-competitive.

""Note zero capitulation in equity positioning"", the research note read, adding that year-to-date, $84 billion has poured into markets and only 2 out of the 18 trading days this month had seen investors withdraw cash.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to start tightening monetary policy to fight inflation has hit global markets hard with New York's S&P 500 index losing 9.2% since the beginning of 2022.
The ""Fed can’t cut inflation on Main St without deflation on Wall St"", BofA analysts argued, saying they remained bearish in regards to the direction of travel for stocks.

Among notable flows in financial markets, the report showed that the week to Wednesday had seen the largest outflow from bonds since March 2021 and the largest inflows to emerging markets equities since the same date.
BofA's 'private clients' -which manage $3.2 trillion of assets - had 11.7% in cash and were net buyers of stocks for eight consecutive weeks.

1475,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 04:27AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Big Bet on Chinese Markets Is Going All Wrong,"(Bloomberg) -- The bar for China’s financial markets to do better this year was so low, virtually everyone on Wall Street was saying the country’s stocks and bonds could only go up.
That bet isn’t going so well. Mainland equities just entered their first bear market since Donald Trump’s trade war. Shares in Hong Kong had their worst week in five months, with short sellers feasting like never before. Credit-market contagion is spreading to some of the strongest property developers for the first time. Assets that were previously resilient like China’s currency and government bonds are no longer immune, with the yuan turning the most volatile since August. 
While it’s still only January, mounting losses are testing the ability of policy makers in Beijing to support markets after the chief securities regulator vowed to “firmly” prevent volatility. It’s also confounding those on Wall Street who predicted easier policy out of Beijing would be the catalyst needed to revive Chinese beaten-down assets. Authorities have cut interest rates and pledged to do more to support the economy.
Signs of Beijing’s unease over the equity market slump are showing up visible measures of support -- from front-page articles in state media appealing for calm to some of China’s largest mutual funds publicly committing to buying their own equity-focused products. The country’s central bank has stepped up its liquidity injections in recent days to see lenders through the seasonal Lunar New Year cash crunch. More targeted intervention is possible as the Communist Party prioritizes stability before the Winter Olympics and in the final months of President Xi Jinping’s second term.
“Consensus is expecting that there will be support for the Chinese economy and markets -- and for us that makes sense,” Paul Gambles, co-founder and managing partner of MBMG Group, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “But making sense of Chinese markets? That’s a bit of a tough task. It’s a hard call for anyone.” 
It can be dangerous to stay long China into a holiday. In 2020 the country’s markets were shut as the Covid-19 pandemic spread from Wuhan -- and the reopen was so brutal that more than 1,000 stocks had to be halted. It was similar in 2019 when a series of tweets from then-President Donald Trump signaled an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland markets will be shut all of next week.
There are plenty of reasons for caution. China’s efforts to maintain its zero-Covid policy are coming under increasing strain. City-wide lockdowns may undermine consumer spending during the key holiday season. The slowdown in the property market, which makes up about a quarter of gross domestic output, is far from over. A rapid withdrawal of stimulus by some countries could also hurt China’s exports -- a key driver of growth in the past two years.
Investors also remain vulnerable to the Communist Party’s opaque and unpredictable policy making. Hopes that Beijing was nearing the end of a crackdown on the technology sector were dashed when China vowed to curb the influence of such companies in a sweeping communique on corruption. Optimism that Beijing was dialing back on its property crackdown has been replaced with skepticism. There’s still nervousness over the future of tutoring companies. A new nationwide campaign on money laundering has raised more uncertainty over where the government will strike next.
Traders are paring risk. The CSI 300 Index of mainland stocks fell 1.2% on Friday, closing at the lowest level in 16 months, while the MSCI China Index is at the lowest since May 2020. Stock-market leverage has dropped for eight straight days.
China high-yield dollar bonds fell as much as 5 cents on the dollar Friday, according to credit traders. Overseas selling of onshore shares continued after Thursday’s $2.3 billion outflows, one of the largest since trading links were expanded in 2016. That weighed on the yuan, which slumped the most since July. Short selling comprised about a fifth of Hong Kong’s total stock turnover on Thursday, the biggest proportion on record. 
The commitment from at least 12 mutual funds to funnel cash into the stock market is likely to have been coordinated. A series of front-page articles in state media have touted the attractiveness of Chinese stocks, with the Securities Times calling the act of the funds “setting a good example.” Newspapers had already appealed for calm earlier in the week.
Most of Wall Street is counting on a 2022 rally in China. Societe Generale, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, UBS and HSBC have all turned overweight on Chinese equities. JPMorgan)’s Marko Kolanovic in December recommended going all in on China this year, predicting the MSCI China Index would surge almost 40%. Morgan Stanley’s Jonathan Garner is the notable holdout, saying there may be more pain in store for Chinese shares.
On the credit front, firms including Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, Axa Investment Managers and Oaktree Capital Group have said in recent months that they’re looking to increase their holdings of Chinese real estate debt. Jason Brown, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) special situations group head, raised an initial $245 million last month for his Arkkan Capital to invest in Chinese distressed property loans and bonds.
There’s still plenty of time for bulls to be right. More stimulus is expected from China’s central bank after it pledged to open its monetary policy tool box. Any sign Beijing is loosening funding restrictions for property developers would go a long way toward lifting sentiment. A weakening yuan wouldn’t be bad news if exports come under pressure.
“China is very different from a policy perspective than anywhere else,” MBMG Group’s Gambles said. “They’ll act very quickly and act very aggressively.”

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>","China home builders, suppliers issue spate of profit warnings as Evergrande woes bite","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A growing number of Chinese construction and decoration companies are writing off assets or issuing profit warnings as debt woes at China Evergrande Group and other property developers debilitate their suppliers.
More such disclosures are expected during the upcoming earnings season, putting pressure on Chinese authorities to do more to limit the contagion from developers' financial crisis and avert job losses.
Guangzhou Holike Creative Home Co, a furniture maker, became the latest company to disclose losses linked to Evergrande, which has racked up over $300 billion in debt, including 200 billion yuan ($31.44 billion) owed to suppliers via commercial paper.
Holike said in an exchange filing on Wednesday it expects 2021 net profit to slump as much as 60% from a year earlier, hurt by receivables to Evergrande that are unlikely to be collected.
In addition, China's property market downturn has dented the value of a company it acquired in 2020, resulting in impairment losses, Holike said, adding it has slashed business with Evergrande and is seeking claims.
Beijing Jiayu Door, Window and Curtain Wall Co also flagged risks this week, saying it turned in a loss of up to 1.4 billion yuan last year, thanks to receivables from Evergrande that are likely to go sour. 
Earlier this month, Guangdong Pak Corp, a maker of lighting fixtures, said it forecast a 85%-90% drop in 2021 earnings, thanks to a jump in Evergrande-related impairment losses. And Shenzhen Wenke Landscape Co said it fell into the red last year due to Evergrande defaults. 
Most China-listed companies will start reporting annual results next month, with more such disclosures expected, as dozens of Chinese suppliers have disclosed debts owed by developers like Evergrande. Some have already set aside provisions.
And despite some easing measures taken by the government to ease developers' liquidity stress and support the cooling economy, recent data suggests the problem will get worse. 
Units of Shimao Group Holdings, Kaisa Group Holdings and Greenland Group were named and shamed this month in a list of Chinese companies ""consistently overdue"" on commercial paper payments.
And the total number of such delinquent firms jumped 26% in December from the previous month, according to the list compiler, the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange. [L1N2TS06Q]
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, is seeking a debt restructuring as it struggles to pay creditors, suppliers and investors in wealth management products. 
Shanghai Trendzone Holdings Group, a residential decoration company, said recently it had filed 333 lawsuits against Evergrande and its subsidiaries, and the impact on earnings is unclear before legal rulings.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss fragrance and flavour maker Givaudan on Friday said it would pass higher costs on to customers this year after rising supply chain costs dented its profit more than expected during 2021.
Demand for fragrances used in soap and toothpaste slowed last year from the very high levels seen at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but sales of perfumes, cosmetics and food and drink consumed outside people's homes recovered.
The Geneva-based group expects a 9% increase in raw material costs this year and intends to pass the increases to customers via price hikes.
It is also facing supply chain issues, including higher distribution and manufacturing costs as surging COVID-19 cases keep essential workers at home.
""We're not missing sales, but it comes with a cost,"" Chief Financial Officer Tom Hallam told Reuters in an interview. 
""We produce what we want to produce, but we have to bring in extra people to do it. We're paying overtime, we're bringing in temporary people,"" he added.
Oreo cookie maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) said on Thursday it expected a larger impact from supply chain snags in its key North American segment in the current quarter.
Givaudan posted a 10.5% higher net profit of 821 million Swiss francs ($883.18 million) for 2021 and a 3% higher dividend of 66 francs per share, both falling short of forecasts in a Refinitiv poll.
Shares, down 15% so far this year, were trading 5.2% lower at 0807 GMT.
Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the comparable EBITDA margin of 22.5% was below expectations, especially in fragrance & beauty areas as higher supply chain costs hit.
""We are not particularly concerned ... Givaudan successfully passed on 100% of the cost increases to customers in 2018 and 2019, albeit with a certain time lag,"" Bertschy said.
Like-for-like sales, which strip out currency changes and acquisitions, increased 7.1% to 6.684 billion francs, in line with forecasts. Sales growth slowed to 5.3% in the final quarter of 2021, Givaudan said. 

It confirmed its 2025 targets of 4-5% organic sales growth and free cash flow of at least 12% of sales.

The airline business has been hard-hit during the pandemic due to strict travel rules in Asia, leading Malaysia's stock exchange to this month classify the firm as financially distressed though it has been raising funds to bolster its balance sheet.
The group proposed changing its name on Jan. 3.
Capital A has been investing heavily in payments business BigPay, logistics arm Teleport and its mobile Super App to gain other sources of revenue, though they remain in growth phases and were loss-making in the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2021.
""Over the past two years we have spent the downturn in flying building a solid foundation for a viable and successful future, which is not solely reliant on airfares alone,"" Capital A Chief Executive Tony Fernandes said in a statement.
The airline business will retain the AirAsia brand, which is well known in Asia, he added.
Fernandes told reporters at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur the carrier, which has five affiliate airlines including long-haul operator AirAsia X, planned to introduce two more to its stable. He declined, however, to give further details. 
The group is also seeking to raise about 1 billion ringgit this year, as it continues efforts to regularise its finances, Fernandes said. 

""The group has more than enough liquidity... we're very focused on growing and adding value,"" he said. 
The carrier on Thursday reported it filled 80% of seats on offer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and had the highest number of passengers since the start of the pandemic as travel rules began to ease.

LVMH shares were up 3.9 percent in early session trading, and the rally in LVMH also lifted up the shares of its luxury goods rivals such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Hermes.
LVMH, which owns brands spanning Hennessy cognac to cosmetics retailer Sephora, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter sales growth accelerated, reaching 20.04 billion euros ($22.31 billion) overall, with growth led by the French group's biggest earners Louis Vuitton and Dior.

The luxury labels propelled a 28% rise in sales of LVMH's largest division, fashion and leather goods, on a like-for-like basis, beating analyst expectations for 16% growth. Revenues for the business in the last three months of last year came in 51% above their 2019, pre-pandemic level.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, with the recent hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve as well as concerns over Russia’s intentions for Ukraine weighing on sentiment despite some strong corporate news.
By 3:10 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6%.
Global stock markets have been pressured this week by the indications that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates as many as five times this year, starting in March.
Concerns remain over Russia’s plans for Ukraine after Moscow said on Thursday it was clear the United States was not willing to address its main concerns, which revolve around the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. Russia has massed troops near Ukraine, prompting Western fears of an invasion. 
These fundamental factors have weighed on sentiment Friday, even with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest company in the world by market capitalization, posting record sales over the important holiday quarter.
Back in Europe, UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stock rose 0.6% after the Italian bank continued the recent good news for the sector, reporting better-than-expected full-year revenues and underlying profit. It confirmed it will pay its first dividend since the pandemic began but is still awaiting ECB approval for its planned buyback. That is expected in February.
H&M (ST:HMb) stock soared over 5% after the world’s second-largest fashion retailer reported a bigger profit rise than expected for the September-November period as sales recovered and said it expects to double sales by 2030. 
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock rose 3% after the French luxury giant reported an impressive fourth quarter, with demand for its high-quality products surging. Sales topped 2019 levels, while profit was up 50% from a year earlier.
On the flip side, Givaudan (SIX:GIVN) stock fell 4.4% after the Swiss fragrance and flavour maker posted a weaker-than-expected rise in net profit and dividend for 2021, while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) stock dropped 1.4% after the semiconductor forecast that chip shortages will last into 2023. 
The economic data slate offered up some good news, with French and Spanish GDP growing faster than expected in the fourth quarter. The French economy grew by 0.7%, and by 7% in 2021 as a whole, the strongest since 1969. That will offset an expected decline in German GDP in the quarter, which is expected to be confirmed later Friday.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, on course for their sixth consecutive weekly gain, with the market remaining concerned over supply levels ahead of the latest meeting of top producers.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, is expected to stick with its plan to increase output in a cautious manner in March when it meets next week.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $86.92 a barrel, having climbed to a seven-year high of $88.54 on Thursday, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $88.39, just off the previous session’s peak, which was the highest since October 2014. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,791.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1124.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Nordic telecoms operator Telia gave an upbeat growth forecast on Friday as it reported better than expected quarterly core earnings, helped by growth in service revenue in markets such as Sweden and the Baltics.
The company forecast service revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to grow in a low single-digit percentages in 2022. 
While the telecoms business is expected to grow by low to mid-single digits, EBITDA from TV and Media will be lower than in 2021 owing to increased investment in content and premium sports rights. 
Chief Executive Allison Kirkby said Telia is looking to continue the strategy laid out last year, aiming to return the company to sustainable and consistent growth.
Kirkby laid out plans last year to cut billions in costs through 2025, including shedding staff, divesting assets and streamlining operations to spur growth and shareholder returns.
One of the bigger divestments is the sale of a 49% stake in its towers unit to Brookfield and Alecta. The unit now has an enterprise value of 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion).
While several European telecom operators are getting out of towers business completely, Telia is taking a longer-term view and has opted for the joint-venture route
Telia's fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA fell 1.6% year on year to 7.29 billion Swedish crowns ($778.02 million), slightly better than the average estimate of 7.22 billion crowns from analysts polled by Refinitiv.
While advertising revenue is back at pre-pandemic levels, boosting TV and media business, roaming revenue is still down because international travel has yet to recover fully, Kirkby said.
""Based on what we saw in December, we are expecting the rebound from roaming to definitely start to come through during the course of this year,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX)'s operating profit more than tripled to a record 9.2 trillion won ($7.62 billion), boosted by strong demand and higher prices of the construction raw material.
Global crude steel production rose 3.7% last year to 1.95 billion tonnes, World Steel Association data showed this month, despite an energy crunch that led to weaker output in top producer China.
POSCO's consolidated operating margins in 2021 were 12.1%, up from 4.2% in 2020.
The company's fourth-quarter consolidated profit was 2.37 trillion won, in line with estimates of 2.3 trillion won, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
For 2022, POSCO expects consolidated sales of 77.2 trillion won, compared with 76.3 trillion won in 2021. The company also forecast capital expenditure of 8.9 trillion won this year.
Meanwhile, the company's shareholders earlier on Friday approved a plan to split off its steel operations and form a holding company called POSCO Holdings Inc.
The new holding company will wholly own the steel unit, which will remain unlisted, and oversee development of new businesses, such as battery materials and lithium. 

POSCO shares closed up 2.9% after the shareholder meeting, while the wider market rose 1.9%.

1486,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 02:01AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Mixed; Apple Lifts Some of Fed-Induced Gloom,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Friday, helped by strong earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) but with investors remaining cautious over the recent hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve as well as Russia’s intentions for Ukraine.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
Global stock markets received a boost late Thursday after Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, posted record sales over the important holiday quarter, the iPhone-maker successfully navigating the supply-chain challenges which have hurt many of its peers.
That said, investors are still digesting the latest comments from the Federal Reserve after the U.S. central bank indicated on Wednesday it was likely to raise rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases that month.
Money markets are now pricing in as many as five Fed hikes in 2022 in line with the U.S. central bank’s hawkish tone, up from the three expected as recently as December.
Back in Europe, concerns remain over Russia’s plans for Ukraine after Moscow said on Thursday it was clear the United States was not willing to address its main concerns, which revolve around the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO.  
Russia has massed troops near Ukraine, prompting Western fears of an invasion. Such an incursion could have severe repercussions for Europe’s energy supplies if Russia limits its natural gas output to the region in response to the expected Western sanctions.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Caixabank on Friday said its fourth-quarter recurrent profit in 2021 fell 52% from the same period a year earlier due to lower one-off gains.
Caixabank, which in March closed the 4.3 billion euros acquisition of Bankia in a defensive deal to better cope with ultra low interest rates and the coronavirus pandemic, reported a underlying profit without extraordinary items related to the merger of 337 million euros ($375.82 million) in the October to December period.
The figure compares with a profit of 705 million euros in the same period a year ago when combining with Bankia's operations on a pro forma basis.
The accounting net profit in the quarter fell 35% to 425 million euros compared to a 433 million euros net profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters. Net profit in the same quarter last year without Bankia stood at 655 million euros.

The lender also said it aimed for a dividend cash pay-out policy of between 50-60% against 2022 consolidated earnings compared to a 50% pay-out rate in 2021. It also announced its intention to implement an open-market share buy-back programme during the 2022 fiscal year.

Investing.com – Chinese developer Hopson Development Holdings Ltd (HK:0754) saw its shares and dollar bonds fall towards record lows after its auditor agreed to resign.
The company’s Hong Kong shares tumbled 18.6% to HK$13.3 ($1.7) by 12:06 AM ET (5:06 AM GMT), after sinking to as low as HK$11.2 earlier in the session. The firm’s note due 2023 also fell 10.5 cents on the dollar to 81.8 cents.
Hopson said on Thursday that its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), had agreed to resign. PwC said the information provided to it to complete auditing procedures was insufficient.
“Hopson’s near-term refinancing prospects and investor sentiment may be hurt on its disclosure,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Andrew Chan and Hui Yen Tay said in a note.
Hopson is one of the ‘safer’ names in the Chinese real estate sector and had so far managed to remain more or less immune to the debt crisis engulfing the sector. Fellow developer China Evergrande Group has not been as fortunate, missing payments on some dollar bonds in December 2021 and struggling to pay off a debt load totaling more than $300 million. Hopson made an offer to buy out China Evergrande in early 2021, which was rescinded later that year.
However, Hopson’s luck may have run out, as invester concerns about the transparency of better developers and the sector’s debt woes continue to grow.
The upcoming earnings season could reveal further pressure points for borrowers, as auditors scrutinize the books for the first time since a clampdown on the debt-ridden sector triggered a wave of defaults.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 11:20PM ET</span>",Apple sales and profit top estimates as hit from chip shortages eases,"By Danielle Kaye, Paresh Dave and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Apple Inc is overcoming the costly global shortage in computer chips, posting record sales over the holiday quarter, beating profit estimates and forecasting that its shortfall is narrowing.
The iPhone maker, which is world's largest company by market capitalization, has handled supply-chain challenges such as factory shutdowns and shipping delays brought on by the pandemic better than any of its top peers, analysts said. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose about 5% in after-hours trading, erasing half their losses on the year. The gains came after the company teased its ambitions for augmented reality in the metaverse https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-teases-metaverse-ar-plans-stock-jumps-2022-01-28. 
More people wanted iPhones, iPads and other gadgets over the holiday quarter than Apple had to sell, costing the company over $6 billion in sales, or in line with what it feared. Yet, Apple, which is many part suppliers' biggest client, used its buying power to squeeze those vendors to ship enough gadgets to power record sales in its iPhones, Mac and wearables and accessories segments. Apple executives said chip shortages are mostly affecting older models of its products and particularly slowed iPad sales.
""They've navigated the supply chain better than everybody, and it's showing in the results,"" said Ryan Reith, who studies the smartphone market for industry tracker IDC.
The four best-selling phones in urban China were all iPhone models, Apple said, as competitors struggled to manufacture rival offerings. It was the top-selling vendor in China for the first time in six years, research firm Counterpoint Research reported on Wednesday.
Nicole Peng, who tracks China's smartphone sector at research firm Canalys, said comparatively low prices and the retreat of chief rival Huawei from the market led to a strong quarter.
Peng said Apple was unlikely to repeat that quarterly performance this year, given it was driven by one-off factors. However, she said the company could still have a strong 2022 if Chinese consumers warm up to a new iPhone SE, which is expected to be released this year.
Apple's growing sales of services such as music, TV and fitness subscriptions also are helping soften the blow of low device supply. The company said it now has 785 million paying subscribers across its at least seven subscription offerings, up by 40 million from last quarter and soothing investors concerned about slowing growth at rivals such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Even better, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that easing chip shortages should mean less than $6 billion in lost revenue in the current quarter. But he declined to estimate further in the future.
""The level of constraint will depend a lot on other companies, what will be the demand for chips from other companies and other industries,"" he said. 
RECORD IPHONE UPGRADES
The iPhone 13, which started shipping days before the quarter began, led to worldwide phone sales revenue https://tmsnrt.rs/3o4nuGc for Apple of $71.6 billion, a 9% increase from the 2020 holiday season that handily beat Wall Street targets, according to Refinitiv data. Maestri attributed the sales bump to a record number of upgrades from older iPhones and double-digit growth in people switching from rivals. 
Apple's overall fiscal first-quarter revenue was $123.9 billion, 11% up from last year and higher than analysts' average estimate of $118.7 billion. Profit was $34.6 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $31 billion and $1.89 per share.
Maestri warned though that revenue growth will slow in the current quarter compared with the December quarter primarily due to less favorable foreign exchange rates and the different launch dates of products.
Apple's only category segment to miss sales expectations was iPads. Sales fell 14% to $7.25 billion compared with analyst estimates of $8.2 billion, seeming to confirm industry predictions that the tablets would have low priority for any scarce parts. 
Services, Apple's second biggest segment after iPhones, increased sales 24% to $19.5 billion. 
Revenue from Mac computers rose 25%, and Apple said the last six quarters have been its best for Mac sales. 
The pandemic has accelerated adoption of digital tools for communication, learning and entertainment, powering Apple to blowout sales over the last two years.
But investors this year have been shifting funds toward safer assets and away from tech stocks such as Apple that have soared during the pandemic with people spending time more time online. 
Wall Street has questioned how long it will take Apple to deliver its next big product, such as an augmented reality (AR) headset for the metaverse.
""We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on Thursday. 
Apple also is facing antitrust pressure in the United States and Europe that could lead to new regulations that cut into its services revenue. 

Late last month, the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) ordered Apple to make changes for apps on offer in the Apple App Store in the Netherlands by Jan. 15 or face fines, after it found that the U.S. company had abused its market dominance by requiring dating app developers to exclusively use Apple's in-app payment system. 
Still, Apple is trading at 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. While down from as much as 35 a year ago, it remains above the company's five-year average of 20 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Apple Inc is stifling competition through its mobile app store, attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia said on Thursday, as they appealed against a ruling that let the iPhone maker continue some restrictive practices.
While dozens of state attorneys general have filed recent antitrust lawsuits against other big tech companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, none had so far taken aim at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Thursday's remarks, led by the state of Utah and joined by Colorado, Indiana, Texas and others, came in a lawsuit in an appeals court against app store fees and payment tools between ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games and Apple.
""Apple's conduct has harmed and is harming mobile app-developers and millions of citizens,"" the states said.
""Meanwhile, Apple continues to monopolize app distribution and in-app payment solutions for iPhones, stifle competition, and amass supracompetitive profits within the almost trillion-dollar-a-year smartphone industry.""
The action comes after a U.S. district judge in Oakland, California, mostly ruled against Epic last year.
That decision found that commissions of 15% to 30% which Apple charges some app makers for use of an in-app payment system the company forced on them did not violate antitrust law.
Epic challenged the ruling in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On Thursday, professors, activist groups and the states weighed in through court filings that described legal arguments in support. 
Apple's reply is expected in March. On Thursday, the company said it was optimistic that Epic's challenge would fail.

The states said in their filing that the lower court erred by failing to adequately balance the pros and cons of Apple's rules and also by deciding that a key antitrust law did not apply to non-negotiable contracts Apple makes developers sign.
""Paradoxically, firms with enough market power to unilaterally impose contracts would be protected from antitrust scrutiny — precisely the firms whose activities give the most cause for antitrust concern,"" they said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, clawing back some of the losses from the previous two days. These losses were driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled a tighter monetary policy.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.04% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the Tokyo core consumer price index grew 0.2% year-on-year in January.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.79%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.53%, with the producer price index growing 1.3% quarter-on-quarter and 3.7% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. Investors also await the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy decision, which will be handed down in the following week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.79%. The city on Thursday shorted the quarantine period for arrivals from 21 to 14 days but extended current social distancing measures until Feb. 17.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.44% while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.81%.
Moves in Asia were somewhat subdued overall ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays.
U.S shares also rallied on Thursday, boosted by strong Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings. However, they ended a volatile session lower, after again failing to hold intraday rallies. U.S. Treasuries were steady and the yield curve flatter.
Investors are still digesting the Fed’s latest policy decision, handed down on Wednesday. Money markets are now pricing in as many as five Fed hikes in 2022 in line with the U.S. central bank’s hawkish tone, up from the three expected as recently as December 2021.
The prospect of reduced COVID-19-era stimulus, from the Fed and other central banks globally, has introduced volatility into the market. Global shares have lost over $7 trillion in January to date.
“Really what we are seeing is historic intraday volatility... it’s been a pretty amazing ride so far this year,” Susquehanna International Group co-head of derivatives strategy Chris Murphy told Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. stocks retreated on Thursday after a solid opening, while the dollar gained as investors prepared for future rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended lower, having been whipsawed by uncertainty in recent days, marked by wide fluctuations and heightened volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.02%, the S&P 500 lost 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%. [.N/C]
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.94%.
Markets opened higher as new data showed the U.S. economy accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 6.9% - the fastest rate since 1984. 
But, as has been the case most of the week, gains were pared as investors processed how strong economic growth might inform the Fed's thinking. Chairman Jerome Powell indicated at a Wednesday news conference that inflation remained higher than the central bank would like and supply chain issues could persist.
""Our new base case for six hikes this year poses challenges to our bullish outlook for U.S. equities. However, it is not sufficient to derail it on a standalone basis if earnings growth remains strong, in our view,"" BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) analysts wrote in a note.
DOLLAR BUILDS
However, the prospect of faster or larger U.S. interest rate hikes helped push the dollar to its highest levels since July 2020.
In its latest policy update on Wednesday, the Fed indicated it was likely to raise rates in March, as widely expected, and reaffirmed plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against other major currencies, climbed 0.8%, its biggest single-day gain in more than two months. 
The outlook for aggressive rate hikes has led to a major reset globally, said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""You just don't know how far the Fed is going to go because we don’t know exactly when inflation will really peak,"" he said. While there is optimism that inflation will subside by midyear, it could get worse and lead to more aggressive Fed action, he said, adding, ""you got a little bit more left in this dollar move.""
The dollar's gain was gold's loss, as the precious metal fell over 1% to more than a two-week low. Spot gold prices fell 1.24% to $1,795.50 an ounce.
Expectations of Fed tightening sent the policy-sensitive U.S. two-year yield to an intraday high of 1.208%, a level last reached in February 2020, before ending at 1.1902%.
The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 1.8101% after hitting a high of 1.88% on Wednesday.
Investors expect the speed at which the Fed tightens policy to be the major determinant of risk sentiment in the coming months, although the bank has said how quickly it hikes will depend on economic data and especially inflation.
Persistent tension between Russia and Ukraine had pushed oil prices to seven-year highs earlier in the week, but prices fell a touch on Thursday.

Brent crude fell 0.2% to $89.81 a barrel. U.S. crude was down 0.3% to $87.08 per barrel.
Russia said on Thursday it was clear the United States was not willing to address its main security concerns in their standoff over Ukraine, but both sides kept the door open to further dialogue.

The company has 14,000 AR apps on its App Store, and Cook suggested this number will rise with further investment.
""We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly,"" said Cook, in response to a question about its plans for the metaverse, a broad term that generally refers to shared virtual world environments that people can access via the internet.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg have reported Apple plans to introduce an AR headset by this or next year with glasses to follow later. Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged these plans. 
Cook's comments on Thursday, and quarterly profit and sales topping estimates, helped drive Apple stock up nearly 5% in after-hours trade.
Apple's services revenue jumped by 24% to $19.5 billion in the just-ended holiday quarter, topping analysts' estimates of $18.6 billion. The company added 785 million subscribers to its handful of paid services such as for streaming music and playing games, an increase from 620 million a year ago and 745 million last quarter.
Cook separately on Thursday said that Apple's research and development efforts are focused on the intersection of hardware, software and services. 
""That's where the magic really happens,"" Cook said. ""There's quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point.""
An AR device could open many opportunities to grow subscriptions. Existing offerings for fitness workouts and video content could grow more attractive through immersive AR experiences.
And as the services and subscribers have grown, Apple's gross profit margins have jumped above 40%, drawing praise from analysts.

Metaverse-related services, such as AR apps, could flip Apple's revenue mix, said analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said it aims to win a bigger share of the smartphone market this year with more 5G-capable models, and pointed to a possible price rebound for its flagship memory chips as early as the first half.
The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker forecast a recovery in global tech device demand on Thursday after reporting its best fourth-quarter profit in four years, although it cautioned about ongoing challenges from supply chain issues and COVID-19. 
Next generation 5G smartphones are set to account for more than half of all smartphone sales in the market in 2022, Kim Sung-koo, Vice President of mobile business, told an investor briefing.
""Our strategy in the mass tier is to actively capture demand from people seeking to replace their phones with 5G models,"" Kim said, adding that the company would pursue more ""global mega-hit models."" 
Analysts said this would pit Samsung (KS:005930), which has around 20% of the global smartphone market, against low-cost Chinese smartphone rivals like Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), OPPO and Vivo in markets outside China. 
The South Korean tech giant was also cautiously upbeat on the possibility of a turnaround in the price of DRAM chips, widely used in data centres and tech devices. 
""We expect strong fundamental demand centering around servers, and solid mobile demand from expansion of 5G models,"" said Han Jin-man, Executive VP of memory chip business.
""Some organisations have forecast DRAM prices could reverse in the first half. We think this is a possible scenario,"" he added, although he noted that supply issues, raw material costs and geopolitical risks remain unknown variables.
The price of DRAM chips dipped 9.5% in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, TrendForce data showed, and analysts expect a further drop in the current quarter. Views are mixed on when they will rebound. 
For non-memory chips, Samsung said supply was expected to remain tight due to increased take-up of 5G-capable devices, demand for high performance computing, increased outsourcing from chip design and manufacturing firms, and continued inventory demand.
The company spent 90% of its 2021 annual capital expenditure of 48.2 trillion won ($40.1 billion) in the chip business, but declined to give guidance for 2022.
CHIP PROFITS
Samsung posted a 53% rise in fourth-quarter operating profit to 13.9 trillion won ($11.6 billion). Profits at its chip business, its largest division, more than doubled from the same quarter a year ago to 8.84 trillion won.
Still, analysts said the profits were lower than the market had expected due to conservative shipments of memory chips, R&D costs and one-off year-end bonuses. 
Samsung said it came in below its initial guidance for memory chip shipments after deciding not to push aggressively to expand sales, signalling a push to prioritise profits over volume. 
""Samsung seems to have considered its low inventory of memory chips, lack of clean room space to expand production in 2022 and the dip in memory chip prices last quarter, and decided not to sell as much,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. 
""This lean toward profitability over volume could continue in the first and second quarters, depending on market conditions."" 
Samsung signaled it is still looking for M&A opportunities.
""We need to maintain the capacity to invest in inorganic growth opportunities,"" said Ben Suh, Executive VP at Samsung, when asked about investor returns. 
Operating profit at Samsung's mobile business rose about 9.9% on-year to 2.66 trillion won in the fourth quarter. 
On Wednesday, Samsung said it will unveil its latest flagship smartphone model on Feb. 9, which analysts expect to lift mobile shipments. 
Net profit rose 64% to 10.8 trillion won. Revenue rose 24% to a record 76.6 trillion won. 

Samsung shares fell 2.5% in afternoon trade on Thursday, compared with the wider market's 3.2% drop.

Shares of the Chicago-based Oreo cookie maker were down about 2% after the bell, as the company's gross margin declined to 37% in the fourth quarter from 39.4% a year earlier. 
Packaged food makers have been struck by soaring shipping and labor expenses due to a strained supply chain, while surging demand for wheat, sugar and other commodities has driven up raw material costs, crimping margins across the sector.
Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is also reeling from a six-week strike of about 1,000 workers at its U.S. plants that took place in August, which coupled with elevated demand and persistent supply chain issues depleted the Cadbury chocolate maker's inventories. 
""We have entered 2022 with low stocks, and we are working to rebuild inventory levels, which takes time in this environment,"" Mondelez Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella said on a call.
The company had stocked up on inventories ahead of the strike, helping it offset a revenue hit in the third quarter. 
""The effect of (the strike) may modestly linger, but should dissipate as the year progresses,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.
The food giant said it expects cost inflation to increase in high single digits compared with 2021. It also warned of an 8-cent hit to its full-year adjusted earnings per share from foreign currency translation, adding it would decrease net revenue growth by about 2.5%.

Even as Mondelez took a hit to its margins, the price hikes and strong consumer demand boosted its revenue by 4.9% to $7.66 billion, above analysts' estimate of $7.59 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Excluding items, the Ritz crackers maker earned 72 cents per share in the quarter, in line with expectations.

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended lower, having been whipsawed by uncertainty in recent days, marked by wide fluctuations and heightened volatility. 
Smallcaps have had a rougher go of it, with the Russell 2000 now more than 20% below its Nov. 8 record high, officially confirming the index has been in a bear market since then. 
""This is a market that is schizophrenic,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""There are those who believe everything negative has been discounted and there are others who believe that the worst is yet to come."" 
""It’s a period of a lot of uncertainty, it’s been this way all month,"" Ghriskey added. 
Among a spate of economic data released on Thursday, the Commerce Department's advance take on fourth-quarter GDP shows the U.S. economy in 2021 grew at its fastest pace in nearly four decades. 
Markets seesawed following the release on Wednesday of the FOMC statement, which left key interest rates near zero, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A session during which he appeared to raise the possibility of more rate hikes this year than previously expected, beginning in March.
The fed funds futures market now prices in nearly five rate hikes this year in the wake of Powell's remarks. 
Geopolitical tensions simmered, as Russia continues to build up troops along the Ukrainian border and diplomats scramble to avoid conflict in the region.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, five ended in the red, with consumer discretionary stocks suffering the largest percentage slide.
Fourth-quarter reporting season has hit full stride, with 145 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 79% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now see, on aggregate, year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings growth of 24.2% for the S&P 500, per Refinitiv.
""The numbers and especially the guidance has not been that inspiring and that’s a factor that’s been limiting the upside so far this week,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. 
Supply-chain challenges, the engine driving inflation through the recovery from the global health crisis, have been a recurring theme this earnings season.
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) cited that issue as the reason behind its disappointing first-quarter earnings forecast, which sent its shares tumbling 7.0%.
Intel's dismal outlook weighed on the broader sector, sending the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index down 4.8%, its worst one-day decline since March 8, 2021.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc dropped 11.6% after the company warned that supply issues will last throughout 2022. Shares of rivals Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive were down 14.1% and 10.5%, respectively.

(Reuters) -A federal jury on Thursday awarded $110 million to two U.S. Army veterans who said combat earplugs sold by 3M Co to the military caused them to suffer hearing damage, the largest verdict yet to result from hundreds of thousands of lawsuits over the product.
Jurors in Pensacola, Florida, sided with U.S. Army veterans Ronald Sloan and William Wayman, who alleged that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2's design was defective, lawyers for the plaintiffs' said.
The two men are among the nearly 300,000 service members and others who have sued 3M claiming they suffered hearing damage as a result of using the earplugs in what has become the largest federal mass tort litigation in U.S. history.
Sloan and Wayman were each awarded $15 million in compensatory damages and $40 million in punitive damages, the lawyers said. Each won more than the previously largest verdict in the litigation of $22.5 million.
""Juries continue to find that 3M's earplugs were defective and that they are responsible for causing irreparable hearing damage to those who served our country,"" plaintiffs' lawyers Bryan Aylstock, Shelley Hutson and Christopher Seeger said in a joint statement.
3M in a statement said it was disappointed and would appeal. It noted it won the last two trials involving the earplugs and said its conduct was consistent with its ""long-time commitment to keeping our U.S. military safe.""
Aearo Technologies, which 3M bought in 2008, developed the product. Plaintiffs allege the company hid design flaws, fudged test results and failed to provide instructions for the proper use of the earplugs.

The trial was the 11th so far to reach a verdict. Plaintiffs in six trials, including Thursday's, have won more than $160 million combined. Juries sided with 3M in the five others.
Five more trials are scheduled this year.

BLYTH, England (Reuters) - Britishvolt said on Friday it will develop batteries for a fully-electric sports car in partnership with British carmaker Lotus, the first publicly-announced customer for the electric vehicle (EV) battery startup.
Britishvolt said the research and development that will go into developing battery cells for a high-performance sports car for Lotus will ultimately trickle down to benefit battery cells for more affordable, mainstream EVs. 
Lotus, which is owned by China's Geely and Malaysia's Etika Automotive, has said it hopes to sell only fully-electric models by 2028.
The carmaker will also expand its range to include high-end electric saloons and sports-utility vehicles.
""Lotus is delighted to be collaborating with Britishvolt to develop new battery cell technology to showcase the thrilling performance that a Lotus EV sports car can deliver,"" Lotus managing director Matt Windle said in a statement.
Carmakers are racing to develop EVs ahead of looming fossil-fuel car bans in Europe and China. 
That poses challenges for sports cars and supercars, which need a great deal of sustained power without lots of additional battery weight.
""Lotus is a performance brand with an ambitious plan,"" Britishvolt executive chairman Peter Rolton told Reuters during a visit to the construction site for Britishvolt's planned battery plant site in the northern English town of Blyth, a large former coal storage site overlooking the North Sea.
""In order for that to work, they need to have performance that goes with the vehicle and you won't get that from a standard battery.""
Rolton said Lotus was the first in a number of customer announcements Britishvolt would make in the coming weeks, including for high-performance vehicles, mainstream EVs and electric commercial vehicles that will require durable, long-lasting batteries.
Last week Britishvolt secured UK government backing for its Blyth plant, unlocking 1.7 billion pounds ($2.28 billion) in private funding from logistics real estate investor Tritax and investment firm abrdn plc.

When the 3.8 billion pound, 45 gigawatt-hour (GWh) plant is fully operational in 2027 it should be able to produce battery packs for over 450,000 EVs annually.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 07:16PM ET</span>",EU drug regulator OKs Pfizer COVID pill for high-risk patients,"(Reuters) -The European Union's drug regulator on Thursday gave the green light to  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s antiviral COVID-19 pill for treating adults at risk of severe illness, as the region scrambles to boost its arsenal to fight the Omicron variant.
The endorsement by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for a conditional approval, if followed as usual by the European Commission, allows EU member states to deploy the drug after the regulator gave guidance for its emergency use late last year.
Italy, Germany and Belgium are among a handful of EU countries that have bought the drug, branded as Paxlovid.
The United States in December authorised Paxlovid and Merck's similar drug molnupiravir.
EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the bloc was now making good progress on lining up treatments, which she described as a second line of defence after vaccines.
""Paxlovid is the first oral antiviral for home use in our portfolio, and has the potential to make a real difference for persons at high risk of progression to severe COVID,"" she said.
Merck's pill is also under review in the EU, but is taking longer to approve because the company revised its trial data in November, saying the drug was significantly less effective than previously thought.
These oral drugs, especially Pfizer's, are seen as promising new treatment options that can be taken at home at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to help prevent hospitalizations and deaths.
""We are proud to have a strong manufacturing footprint in Europe, which will help support the production of up to 120 million courses of Paxlovid globally,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Paxlovid, a two-drug antiviral regimen, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retained its effectiveness against the Omicron variant as well.
In the trial however, it was only tested on unvaccinated individuals, raising questions on its potential use in high-risk patients who did get inoculated. EMA did not limit its endorsement to the non-vaccinated.

Germany ordered 1 million courses late in December. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said on Jan. 2 he expected the country's drug regulator to give a national emergency go-ahead before the end of the month and that rollout would start then. 
Italy will receive 200,000 courses in February and has the option to buy an additional 400,000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Visa Inc beat Wall Street's quarterly estimates on Thursday as more international travel and e-commerce drove an increase spending volumes.
While travel spending has stalled since late December due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Visa (NYSE:V) executives said they believe the recovery will resume and net revenue will grow in the second fiscal quarter this year.
""The upside is going to come from the continued recovery of travel and the affluent customer getting back in the mix of spending at the levels they were pre-pandemic,” Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Alfred Kelly said on a call with analysts. 
The world's largest payments processor reported transactions rose 21% to $47.6 billion during the quarter compared with a year earlier. 
Cross-border volumes rose 40%, marked by a steep increase in travel between September and November when the U.S. border and most of the borders within Europe reopened. 
Visa's chief financial officer, Vasant Prabhu, said that even if countries reinstate border closures this year due to new COVID-19 variants, spending appears to rebound quickly when consumers can travel. 
""(Open borders) can have a sizable and immediate impact,"" Prabhu said. ""Our assumption is for steady improvement through the year.""
Shares rose by as much as 2.5% in after-hours trading following the company's results.
Net revenue rose to $7.1 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, an increase of 24% over the prior year.
Visa reported profit of $3.9 billion, or $1.81 per share. 

Analysts, on average, had estimated net income of $1.70 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Rival card companies Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) also reported that they beat quarterly profit estimates this week, powered by renewed consumer spending on international travel, dining and shopping.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 06:45PM ET</span>","Robinhood posts $423 million net loss, shares sink after hours","By Hannah Lang and Mehnaz Yasmin
(Reuters) -Commission-free brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) on Thursday posted a $423 million net loss in the latest quarter, and its shares tumbled as much as 15% in after-hours trade even as revenue edged past analysts' estimates.
Robinhood reported a net loss of $423 million or $0.49 per share in the three months ended December. A year earlier, which was before its IPO, the company posted net income of $7 million or $0.01 per share. 
Shares of Robinhood sank as much as 15% to $9.98 in extended trading following results. The share price at its IPO in July last year was $38, and its record high in August was $85.
Robinhood, in its third set of results as a public company, posted total revenue of $363 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to $318 million a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $362.14 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Robinhood's costs during the fourth quarter increased 162% from the previous year, contributing to the company's net loss.
On a call with reporters, Robinhood Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick attributed much of the costs to share-based compensation and increasing headcount.
""We think we’re in a really good position to start slowing that from here,"" he said. 
Transaction-based revenue from cryptocurrencies jumped 304% to $48 million in the fourth quarter, while revenue from equity trading declined 35% to $52 million. 
Like many tech start-ups, Robinhood has yet to turn a profit following its IPO. Although revenue was a positive sign, its monthly active users declined 8% from the previous quarter to 17.3 million as retail investors pulled back from the market. 
Still, Warnick said that ""there is nothing to suggest our customers are disengaging.""
He said it was possible Robinhood will become profitable in 2022, but indicated 2023 was a more likely target depending on overall market conditions and the launch of new products.
Robinhood enjoyed a strong run during the pandemic, with homebound investors using its app to trade stocks and other assets. It was at the center of a trading mania for meme stocks in January last year. 
But last year’s retail trading frenzy also precipitated a number of regulatory probes. Robinhood's legal costs soared from $1.4 million in 2019 to more than $136 million in July 2021. 
Trading activity rose when the Federal Reserve injected massive liquidity into capital markets and investors raced to cash in on the boom. But now the Fed is expected to scale back asset purchases and raise interest rates.
Cryptocurrencies have been hammered recently. Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency, plunged 50% to $32,951 last week.
For the first quarter of this year, Robinhood expects total net revenue will be less than $340 million, which would be down 35% from a year earlier, when the meme stock rally boosted trading. 
Several analysts believe Robinhood's share price could be pressured https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-shares-stumble-trading-frenzy-wanes-regulators-circle-2022-01-27 by worries about a potential crackdown from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on payment for order flow (PFOF) — whereby brokers route trades to wholesale market makers in return for a fee. 
Robinhood derived approximately 72% of its revenue from PFOF and other transaction rebates in the fourth quarter of 2021.

It has said it does not expect the SEC to ban the practice, but expressed confidence it could find other ways to generate revenue, possibly executing client orders internally.
This week, Robinhood said it had built a net capital position of $2.8 billion, more than 21 times what is currently required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other steps to avoid trading restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel will hold a hearing next week on self-driving vehicles, even as a push in Congress to speed deployment of autonomous vehicles has stalled.
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's subcommittee on highways and transit said Thursday it will hold a Feb. 2 hearing titled ""The Road Ahead for Automated Vehicles"" that will include experts, labor leaders and industry representatives.
Transport Workers Union of America President John Samuelsen will testify, said a spokeswoman for the union that represents more than 150,000 airline, railroad, transit and other workers.
Also expected to testify are Nat Beuse, head of safety at self-driving startup Aurora Innovation Inc, and representatives of the Teamsters union and the Self-Driving Coalition, which on Wednesday renamed itself the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA), and includes companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo LLC.
Last year, Congress rebuffed efforts by Republican Senator John Thune to approve legislation easing regulations on autonomous vehicles.
Thune proposed granting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the power to grant exemptions for tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind.
Thune and other lawmakers have sought for more than five years to win approval to advance the vehicles they say could have a dramatic impact on roadway safety.
""For automated vehicle technology to advance, it is imperative that the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation,"" Thune said in May.

But the effort has faced significant opposition from unions and groups representing trial attorneys.
In May, Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department for the AFL-CIO, told U.S. lawmakers at a separate hearing that autonomous vehicles place millions of jobs at risk and self-driving legislation should not apply to commercial trucks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday voted to revoke the authorization for China Unicom (NYSE:CHU)'s U.S. unit to operate in the United States, citing national security concerns.
The 4-0 vote to revoke the authority that had been granted in 2002 is the latest move by the American regulator to bar Chinese telecommunications carriers from the United States because of national security concerns.
The order requires China Unicom Americas to end domestic interstate and international telecommunications services in the United States within 60 days of the order's publication.
The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
A lawyer for the company released a statement from China Unicom that said the FCC decision was ""without any justifiable grounds and without affording the required due process. It added that China Unicom ""will proactively protect the rights and interests of the company and its customers.""
The FCC said China Unicom Americas is ultimately owned and controlled by the Chinese government and provides mobile virtual network operator services and international private leased circuit and Ethernet private line services along with IP transit, cloud and resold services in the United States.
FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said since the approval ""the national security landscape has shifted and there has been mounting evidence - and with it, a growing concern - that Chinese state-owned carriers pose a real threat to the security of our telecommunications networks.""
The FCC said China Unicom's ""responses were incomplete, misleading, or incorrect.""
Rosenworcel noted that last year the FCC published the first-ever list of communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to national security. This month, she wrote to the Commerce Department, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and other agencies in order to update that list.
FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said China Unicom ""can continue to offer data center services to American consumers"" despite the revocation.
He said the FCC and Congress should examine this issue and determine whether the commission needed broader authority to address security concerns posed by the centers.
The FCC began making efforts in March to revoke the authorization for China Unicom, Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet.

In October, the FCC revoked the U.S. authorization for China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) (Americas), saying it ""is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government."" The Chinese failed to win an appeal of the decision.
In 2019, the FCC rejected China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd's bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services, citing national security risks.

""I want to be very clear: Nothing is off the table, everything is on the table,"" von der Leyen told CNN in an interview late on Thursday, responding to a question on whether Nord Stream 2 would be halted if Russia invaded Ukraine. 
Diplomatic efforts are continuing to defuse a crisis created by Russia massing some 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders.
""The (European) Commission is responsible for designing, shaping and developing the sanctions (on Russia) - in the financial field, in the economic field, in the technology field,"" von der Leyen said.

""These figures tell you that we have a strong leverage and that it would be very painful for Russia"" to escalate the aggression against Ukraine, von der Leyen said, adding she was working very closely with U.S. President Joe Biden on a strategic partnership on energy security.
Asked about whether Russia could be cut off from the SWIFT global payment system if it attacked Ukraine, von der Leyen repeated that nothing was off the table. She refused, however, to go into any detail on an EU sanctions package.

(Reuters) -Grupo Aeromexico has reached a $40-million deal with a group of unsecured creditors to withdraw their objection to the airline's bankruptcy restructuring plan, Aeromexico's lead counsel said on Thursday.
The move is the first step in what is likely to be a days-long Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearing out of New York. Despite the agreement with the unsecured creditors' committee, objections still remain from an ad hoc group of junior creditors, most notably Invictus Global Management.
As part of the deal, Aeromexico offered the unsecured creditors potential distributions from a four-year, $40-million ""contingent value right"" note which would dole out cash distributions as long as Aeromexico outperforms its targets, counsel Timothy Gaulich of Davis Polk & Wardwell said.
""That is very good news indeed,"" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman said after the deal was announced.
Aeromexico, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in June 2020, on Thursday began making its case to Chapman for its restructuring proposal, which would infuse new capital into the company and make Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), a frequent investor in distressed companies, the largest shareholder. 
Though the airline has lined up the support it says it needs from its multiple creditor groups, some still say the plan should not be approved unless junior creditors, some of whom may see just pennies on the dollar, receive better recoveries.
Chapman, who did not rule on the plan on Thursday, has set aside several days for the hearing, which is set to resume on Friday. If she ultimately approves the deal, Aeromexico - one of three major Latin American airlines that filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic - will be able to exit bankruptcy. 

The plan, according to the airline, would reduce its debt by$1 billion and save around 13,000 jobs. But some junior creditors argue it is overly beneficial to existing shareholders, including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and four board members, at their expense.
Delta and the four Mexican individuals are in line to maintain some equity in the reorganized company. Delta, which is expected to hold around 20% of the company after the restructuring, has said the plan's approval is critical to maintaining its long-term relationship with Aeromexico.

Apple shares gained more than 5% in after-hours trade following the report.
Apple announced EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $123.95 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $118.68 billion.
iPhone revenue, which makes up about half of total revenue, rose to $71.6 billion from $65.60 billion a year earlier, beating estimates of $68.34 billion.
The higher-than-expected figure comes as consumers rushed to buy a new slate of products including the iPhone 13, and new Macbook product line.
Revenue from Apple’s service business including Apple News, Apple TV+ and iCloud, grew to $19.52 billion from $15.76 billion, and topped estimates of $18.61 billion.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Shares of Mexican telecoms giant  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) fell on Thursday after a regulator scuttled its long-term goal to enter the local pay TV market, raising speculation over the next moves by the company controlled by the family of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim.
The stock dropped 3.94%, the biggest daily dip since September, exceeding the 1% decline in Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC, but analysts noted even broader losses on financial markets.
The Mexican telecom industry regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), concluded a vote https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/america-movil-still-without-mexico-pay-tv-permit-after-regulator-vote-source-2022-01-27 on Wednesday without authorizing America Movil a pay TV license in that country, a source with knowledge of the process told Reuters.
The company is already Latin America's largest pay TV provider, with markets that include Brazil and Colombia.
The IFT and America Movil declined to comment.
""I think now the real negotiations happen behind the scenes,"" said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. ""Carlos Slim .... is not going to give up. He's pulled so many rabbits out of a hat, you lose count.""
Deemed a ""preponderant agent"" by the IFT due to its market share, America Movil had been barred from providing pay TV in Mexico since the privatization of state telecom firm Telmex in the early 1990s. That later evolved into America Movil.
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj had spoken of America Movil's ambition to get the permit by the end of last year.
However, U.S. officials this month voiced concern to Mexican officials about competition if America Movil was granted the license, Reuters exclusively reported https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/exclusive-us-voices-concerns-mexico-ahead-decision-america-movil-pay-tv-license-2022-01-24.
America Movil executives later called a news conference to say they wanted to meet U.S. officials https://www.reuters.com/business/america-movil-says-happy-meet-us-officials-discuss-plans-2022-01-25 to discuss their plans.
The firm had pledged added investment of 8 billion pesos ($387 million) to expand its fiber optic network if it got the green light to enter pay TV.
Entner at Recon Analytics said he believed the company would still invest the money. ""You're not going to cut off the nose to spite the face,"" he added.
The failure to get a pay TV permit is unlikely to have a major financial impact, analysts said.
""We believe the outlook is favorable for America Movil due to valuations, financial leverage,"" said independent analyst Carlos Hernandez. ""In general, the view remains positive.""
Slim's good relations with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador may help, analysts said.
The tycoon's construction arm Grupo Carso had come under fire for its role the building of a Mexico City metro railway line that collapsed in May, killing 26 people.

Carso pledged to rebuild the damaged stretch at no cost to the government after an independent auditor found that missing bolts and poor welding contributed to the crash.
Slim and Lopez Obrador are likely to act in accordance with longer term interests than the short term, said Ernesto Piedras, head of Latin American market consultancy The CIU. ""I don't think there's a fracture.""

1515,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 04:16PM ET</span>","Uber, Canadian union reach deal to support gig worker benefits, flexibility","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Thursday said it had reached an agreement with Canada's largest services-sector union to offer employee-like benefits to contractors who work as ride-hail and food delivery drivers.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) and United Food and Commercial Workers Canada (UFCW) said https://www.uber.com/en-CA/newsroom/uber-canada-and-ufcw-canada-reach-historic-national-agreement-to-benefit-drivers-and-delivery-people they will jointly lobby Canada's provincial governments to pass labor reforms that would provide gig workers with minimum earnings of at least 120% of local minimum wage, a benefits fund that includes pension and sick pay and other workers' rights.
Today, those benefits are generally reserved for employees, leaving gig workers, who are largely independent contractors, without benefits and protections.
Under the five-year agreement, Canada's 100,000 Uber drivers and delivery workers would also have a right to legal representation by the union in case of disputes with the company, such as when getting kicked off Uber's platform.
The union will also meet with Uber twice a year to address workers' health and safety concerns, said Barry Sawyer, the executive assistant to the UFCW national president.
Sawyer said the union purposefully avoided addressing the thorny issue of gig workers' legal status in its agreement with Uber. 
Uber and labor unions around the world have for years sparred over the question of whether gig workers should be reclassified employees, a designation that would force Uber to provide substantial and costly benefits.
""We're not focused on what you call the workers; the government can make that decision. We just want them to get the rights and benefits they deserve,"" Sawyer said.
Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer drivers. Many labor unions, some lawmakers and the Biden administration have said gig workers should be reclassified as employees.
In surveys with UFCW, drivers said they wanted to maintain the flexibility to work on their own schedule, Sawyer said.
Uber,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), DoorDash Inc and other companies have argued that flexibility would be eliminated if they were forced to reclassify workers employees.
In recent years, Uber has pushed lawmakers across the United States, Canada and the European Union to implement what it refers to as the ""third way"" - a compromise that would maintain workers' contractor status, but provide them with some benefits. 

Uber struck a similar deal last year https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/ubers-uk-drivers-gain-collective-bargaining-with-union-recognition-2021-05-26/#:~:text=LONDON%2C%20May%2026%20(Reuters),on%20behalf%20of%20the%20workforce with Britain's GMB union, allowing it to represent up to 70,000 drivers and boosting the power of workers with collective bargaining.
California voters in 2020 approved such a compromise model in a decisive win for the companies, dividing the U.S. labor https://www.reuters.com/business/gig-companies-push-state-level-worker-laws-faces-divided-labor-movement-2021-06-09 movement in its strategy towards gig workers.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up intraday gains to trade lower Thursday, as a slump in Tesla and an Intel-led rout in chip stocks weighed on the broader market just as investors appeared to brace for a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.02%, or 7 points, the Nasdaq lost 1.4%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, though warned supply chain issues could weigh on output this year, sending its shares more than 11% lower.
Some Wall Street analysts, however, were encouraged by the electric vehicle maker’s results including its plans to boost production by 50% in 2022.
“As we tweak shipment estimates higher, we raise our PT to $1,103 (from $1,080),” Oppenheimer said in a note.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), meanwhile, closed more than 7% lower as its better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance were overshadowed by concerns that increased investment costs will weigh on growth.
“Q4 was a strong quarter with Intel providing upside across nearly all metrics … but Intel's guide disappointed as higher investment expense (both depreciation and opex) is again slated to weigh on earnings,” Wedbush said in a note.
The slump in semis weighed on broader tech, though big tech offset some losses, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) leading the gains to the upside.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is set to report after the closing bell, pared gains to close flat.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) recovered some ground, rising 6% after Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman revealed that he had racked up more than 3.1 million shares of streaming giant during its steep selloff on Friday.
Big tech has come under fire in recent weeks as concerns about a rising interest rate environment have dented sentiment on growth stocks.
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday indicated the Fed could raise interest rates in March, and also hinted at a faster and possible more aggressive rate hike path ahead. 
Cathie Woods’ Ark fund -- with Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN),  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) among its top five holdings -- is often seen a barometer for sentiment on high-flying growth stocks that have come under pressure.
But valuations in megacap tech have fallen to levels that could attract investors, once again.
“A lot of the Ark fund type of stocks have gotten demolished ... but you're going to see people going back into some of these megacap tech companies because now you're starting to see value in these names which have sold off a lot,"" said Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group told Investing.com’s Yasin Ebrahim in an interview on Thursday.
""Big megacap stocks like Microsoft that continue to produce good earnings on a quarterly basis will attract longer-term investor money, and will probably end up getting back to their 52 week highs,” Lee added.
On the economic front, the U.S. economy grew by a more than expected 6.9% in the fourth quarter, but economists were quick to downplay the acceleration. ""Q4 GDP rose by an impressive 6.9%, but the details were much less impressive. Final demand was weak across the board, at least compared to the growth rates in prior quarters,"" Jefferies said."

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 03:50PM ET</span>",Musk's bets on Tesla: human-like robots and self-driving cars,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Tesla's most important products this year and next will not be cars, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday, but software that drives them autonomously and a humanoid robot.
The audacious promises by the best-known billionaire in the electric car industry face major challenges, from technology to regulation. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other auto technology companies have missed their targets to deploy self-driving cars for years.
""I love the fact that they're pushing the envelope, but I think they are too aggressive,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin.
Musk has built a career on defying skeptics with businesses in electric cars and rockets. Some Tesla drivers buy $12,000 self-driving packages in the expectation that full autonomy is around the corner, and 60,000 Tesla drivers are testing the latest self-driving software, a scale that rivals can only dream of.
""I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than human this year. I would be shocked,"" Musk said, predicting full self-driving would become ""the most important source of profitability for Tesla.""
""It's nutty good from a financial standpoint,"" he said, noting that robotaxis would boost a vehicle's utility five times as owners can send their cars out to work when not needed.
Musk said human-like robots and self-driving cars are more important than Cybertruck or $25,000 electric cars. Tesla shares fell 10% to the lowest level in over three months on Thursday after the most valuable automaker delayed releasing new vehicles like Cybertruck until next year because of supply chain problems. Musk said Tesla is not currently developing $25,000 electric cars.
99.999999999% SAFE
Tesla uses cameras and artificial intelligence, avoiding other technologies such as radar and lidar sensors that rivals say are key to achieving full autonomy. That approach has drawn fire.
""You have to be able to not only just see a person, like right in front of you, you have to do so, with 99.999999999% reliability. Even running over someone once is not an acceptable answer,"" Austin Russell, CEO of lidar maker Luminar, told Reuters.
Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor working on autonomous vehicle safety, said a big problem is that at scale, unusual cases constantly can crop up.
""Without a human driver to handle safety for novel situations the machine learning hasn't been taught already, it's very difficult to ensure safety in a completely automated vehicle,"" he said.
REGULATION
Even if the technology works, Tesla would come under more rigorous scrutiny from regulators before deploying fleets of free-roaming robotaxis. U.S. auto safety regulators opened a safety probe into Tesla's advanced driver assistant system after crashes involving the vehicles and parked emergency vehicles.
Federal vehicle safety regulators have issued guidelines to states, but not comprehensive standards governing self-driving cars.
Some state laws require approval for a fully autonomous vehicle, Koopman said.
Just a year ago, Musk said during an earnings call he was ""highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.""
Tesla's autopilot engineer at the time, CJ Moore, last year told the California regulator that Musk's tweet on self-driving technology ""does not match engineering reality.""
Musk also said engineers were working to launch a humanoid robot next year, called Optimus, that could eventually address global labor shortages, and in the short term might be able to carry items around a factory.

""For performing dangerous and repetitive tasks, using a humanoid robot is exactly the wrong approach,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
Robots may be more important than cars, Musk said. ""This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Southwest Airlines Co on Thursday reported its first quarterly profit in two years, but warned of a loss in the current quarter through March as the Omicron coronavirus variant depresses revenue and drives up costs.
The Texas-based carrier expects to be profitable for the remaining three quarters of 2022 and for the full year.
While leisure travel tends to cool off in January and February in a normal year, Southwest said the Omicron variant has led to further weakness in bookings and more ticket cancellations.
It expects a $330 million hit to revenue in the first two months of this quarter due to the drop in demand for leisure and business travel.
Southwest's shares were down 2% at $42.83 in afternoon trade.
Incoming chief executive Bob Jordan said the carrier was ""optimistic"" about bookings and revenue trends for March, when it expects to return to profitability.
""With COVID-19 cases trending downward, the worst appears to be behind us,"" said Jordan, who is due to become the company's sixth CEO next month.
The comments were consistent with those from other U.S. carriers. 
New York-based JetBlue, which on Thursday reported a loss for the quarter through December, expects a sequential month-on-month improvement in travel demand after the Omicron-induced setback, resulting in a profitable second quarter and a ""very strong"" summer for the company.
 Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) anticipates profitable growth in 2022 as its capacity is projected to reach pre-pandemic levels by this summer. The Seattle-based company, which faced operational disruption due to COVID-19, reported a profit for the fourth quarter.
OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, HIGHER COSTS 
An increase in COVID-19 infections among employees and winter storms have led to mass flight cancellations. Southwest has canceled more than 5,600 flights, thus far, this month, which is estimated to cost it $50 million in revenue.
The company said about 5,000 employees, roughly 10% of its workforce, had contracted the virus in the first three weeks of January. 
To mitigate the staffing issues, it is offering pay incentives for operational employees through early February. It has also further cut its capacity for the first half of the year.
The company said its operation and staffing now have stabilized. All the incentives, however, are estimated to inflate its costs by $150 million in the current quarter.
Southwest has plans to add at least 8,000 employees to its workforce this year. But a tight labor market is driving up its wage costs. For example, it has raised starting hourly pay to $17 per hour from $15, which is estimated to cost the company $20 million-$25 million this year.
""The labor market continues to be a challenge,"" Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo told investors on an earnings call.
Higher labor and airport costs along with lower capacity are estimated to increase its overall costs by as much as 24% in the current quarter compared with the same period in 2019.

The company, however, expects cost pressure to peak in the current quarter.
Strong holiday travel demand before the Omicron outbreak helped Southwest report an adjusted profit of 14 cents per share for the quarter through December, its first quarterly profit without U.S. government aid since 2019.

(Reuters) - Global commodities merchant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc took a major step this week to becoming a greater force in the international food chain with a deal to buy the grains business of U.S.-based Gavilon.
The acquisition, due to close in the second half of this year and subject to regulatory review, gives Glencore's Viterra unit significantly more physical grain handling assets in the United States.
It would also would elevate Viterra to the third-largest exporter of Brazilian soybeans, ahead of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co, according to data from the Cargonave shipping agency.
Rising demand for food and biofuels made from crops has generated record profits for large grain companies, including ADM and Cargill Inc.
The deal, however, falls short of elevating Glencore, among the largest global metals and energy merchants, to the upper tier of global grains traders because of its limited presence in the United States, U.S.-based export traders said. The club includes ADM,  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Co. Glencore's previous attempts to join this elite group of merchants known as the ABCDs of grain included failed acquisition approaches to Bunge and Dreyfus in recent years.
""This puts them among the players that can physically originate grain (in the United States), rather than just a paper trader. It elevates their status, but they'd have to spend a lot more money to be on the level of ADM or Cargill or Bunge,"" said a U.S. exporter who asked not to be named. 
Viterra has grains handling assets like elevators and ports in Canada, Europe and South America, but the company has only trading offices and very limited grain storage and transportation in the United States. The company said the Gavilon acquisition would ""provide more value and flexibility"" to its customers.
But Gavilon parent company Marubeni said it would retain eight Gavilon grain elevators in the northern United States, as well as ""part of the equity interest"" in a grains export terminal in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a crucial outlet for U.S. shipments to Asia.
The deal may benefit U.S. farmers as Glencore's global trading and shipping networks allow Viterra to be more competitive when buying grain from them.

""This for them is a very good entry into the U.S. market and it will increase competition for bushels,"" said Sterling Smith, director of agricultural research at AgriSompo.
""It potentially could open up more multinational activity and I could see it being positive for exports over time, opening up new markets particularly markets like Europe where Glencore is quite strong.""

Increased vaccinations and easing pandemic-related curbs had backed a recovery in spending, but surging COVID-19 infections from the Omicron variant pressured cross-border travel in the tail end of the fourth quarter and into January. 
Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach, however, said cross-border travel will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. 
""There are early signs that the Omicron will be relatively short-lived."" 
Shares of the company rose 4.3% to $359.22 as cross-border volumes - a key metric that tracks card spending beyond the country of issue - surged 53% during the quarter.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA)'s gross dollar volumes jumped 23% to $2.1 trillion from a year earlier. The metric represents the dollar value of the transactions processed. 
Rival  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) also beat quarterly profit estimates on record levels of spending through its cards, while  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) is slated to report earnings later in the day.
Mastercard's net revenue rose 27% to $5.2 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, above estimates of $5.16 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The slump in semis weighed on broader tech, though big tech offset some losses, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) leading the gains to the upside.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is set to report after the closing bell, pared gains to trade flat intraday.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) recovered some ground, rising 6% after Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman revealed that he had racked up more than 3.1 million shares of streaming giant during its steep selloff on Friday.
Big tech has come under fire in recent weeks as concerns about a rising interest rate environment have dented sentiment on growth stocks.
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday indicated the Fed could raised interest rates in March, and also hinted at a faster and possible more aggressive rate hike path ahead.
Cathie Woods’ Ark fund, which counts Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN),  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) among its top five holdings and is often seen a barometer for sentiment on high-flying growth stocks that have come under pressure, fell 4%.
But valuations in megacap tech have fallen to levels that could attract investors, once again.
“A lot of the Ark fund type of stocks have gotten demolished ... but you're going to see people going back into some of these megacap tech companies because now you're starting to see value in these names which have sold off a lot,"" said Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group told Investing.com’s Yasin Ebrahim in an interview on Thursday.
""Big megacap stocks like Microsoft that continue to produce good earnings on a quarterly basis will attract longer-term investor money, and will probably end up getting back to their 52 week highs,” Lee added."

That was the highest figure since a peak on Nov. 30, 2021, when retail investors bought a net of more than $2.2 billion, the report said.
According to Vanda, the top five biggest net purchases on Wednesday were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund (ETF), AMD, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
Retail investors were net buyers earlier in the week as well, after having been net sellers on Thursday and Friday of last week, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Peng Cheng.
On Monday, when the S&P 500 saw its biggest swing since March 26, 2020, recovering 4.3 percentage points from its session low to the market close, retail traders were net sellers up to 12:30 p.m., Cheng said in a client note from late Wednesday.
""However, retail traders turned aggressive buyers again Monday afternoon and bought +$1.3B between 12:30 – 4:00PM. On Tuesday, they continued to buy consistently throughout the day at a pace of $250MM per hour, until the buying flattened in the last hour of the trading day,"" he said.

For the week starting last Wednesday until Tuesday, single stocks were sold, while ETFs were bought, with the most popular being S&P 500 trackers and gold ETFs, Peng said. A leveraged long ETF linked to Nasdaq stocks, ProShares UltraPro QQQ was net sold by retail traders, while ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ, which shorts Nasdaq-linked stocks, was bought, he added.
In single stocks, retail investors were net sellers of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which posted disappointing quarterly financial results, as well as of stocks commonly seen to be popular retail names, such as Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Roblox, and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), he said.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 02:55PM ET</span>","Tesla sinks after supply chain warning, hitting other EV makers","By Noel Randewich and Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) -Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc slid on Thursday, dragging down rivals after the leading electric car maker delayed releasing new vehicles until next year because of supply chain disruptions it said could last through this year.
Tesla's stock dropped 8%, down 30% from its record high in November and set for its biggest one-day percentage fall since then, after the U.S. company's strong quarterly report came with its supply chain warning. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk told a quarterly conference call that Tesla would not launch new models like Cybertruck this year because it would dent volume growth in the face of supply chain headwinds that would be alleviated only next year.
He said Tesla would focus on ramping up volume of existing models in 2022 by more than 50% rather than launching new ones.
The warning bodes ill for legacy automakers and startups, which have promised new electric vehicle (EV) models in coming months. 
""Tesla is even having trouble. Other EV firms are not going to be able to produce these vehicles as fast as they want,"" said Curzio Research CEO Frank Curzio, adding that the volume growth of many new models could be pushed into 2023.
Shares of other EV makers also fell, outpacing the Nasdaq's slide. Rivian Automotive Inc dropped 9% and was on track to close at its lowest since the EV pickup truck maker's market debut in November.
Lucid Group Inc dropped 11%, Lordstown Motors Corp lost 8% and Nikola Corp fell more than 7%. U.S. shares of Chinese EV maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc slid almost 9%.
Musk said Tesla was not working on a model that would sell for $25,000, although analysts have said it needed such a car to hit its volume targets.

At least six analysts raised their price targets after Tesla's report. Some looked beyond supply chain issues and pointed to strong growth expectations.
The median analyst price target is now $1,087, which is about 26% above Tesla's current price of $862.89.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 02:46PM ET</span>","Textron sees higher corporate jet production, shares drop on 2022 guidance","(Reuters) -Textron Inc expects to continue ramping up business jet production in 2022 on demand from wealthy travelers, but broader industry supply-chain hiccups, labor shortages and recent surges in COVID-19 cases remain challenges.
Textron (NYSE:TXT) shares slipped 6% in afternoon trading, after the U.S. maker of Cessna business jets disappointed investors with some of its 2022 guidance.
Cautious passengers avoiding commercial flights during the pandemic have helped drive U.S. private air traffic above 2019 levels. 
Business jet makers, eager to capitalize on that demand, are working with suppliers to mitigate the impact of global shipping and supply chain disruptions, along with the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant.
""We have been ramping up the production rate. We continue to do that and expect to continue to do that throughout the course of 2022,” Textron Chief Executive Scott Donnelly told analysts on Thursday.
But Donnelly said Textron would be cautious with any increases and not “want to do something stupid and try to go radically accelerate production rates and then burn down backlog.“ 
Textron's Donnelly said supplier issues have not slowed production rates or 2022 deliveries. A temporary spike in Omicron cases at the turn of the year, however, had some impact on operations.
Textron, which also produces helicopters, reported a fourth-quarter revenue miss, with its aviation division delivering 46 jets in the quarter, down from 61 a year earlier. 
It delivered 167 jets in 2021, up from 132 in 2020, and reported an aviation backlog of $4.1 billion at year end.

The company expects revenue of about $13.3 billion for 2022, compared to analysts' estimates of $13.56 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Textron expects 2022 earnings per share between $3.80 and $4.00. The company reported revenue of $3.32 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, below analysts' estimate of $3.44 billion.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 02:41PM ET</span>",Court dismisses claims Robinhood wrongly restricted 'meme stock' trades,"By Jody Godoy
(Reuters) -A U.S. federal court on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) of violating state laws by restricting trades on so-called meme stocks during a January 2021 rally, a move that retail traders allege resulted in billions in losses.
Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the federal court in Miami ruled that retail investors cannot pursue negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims against the commission-free brokerage, citing Robinhood's customer agreement which allowed it to restrict trading.
Natalia Salas, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they plan to appeal the decision on behalf of investors who were not bound by the Robinhood customer agreement.
The lawsuit was part of the wave of litigation after the brokerage temporarily barred customers from buying certain hot stocks, including  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, as their value soared during the social-media fueled rally.
The investors alleged that Robinhood had courted customers with promises of expanding access to the stock market, but was indifferent to known risks tied to increased demand.
The lawsuit sought damages on behalf of Robinhood customers as well as traders who lost money on GameStop, AMC and 11 other stocks.
In her 66-page opinion, Altonaga wrote that while traders were ""gravely disappointed"" by the plunge in meme stock prices that occurred after trades were restricted, ""the law does not afford relief to every unfulfilled expectation.""
Robinhood is pleased with the decision, spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay said in a statement. ""Once more, this confirms that the unfounded allegations against Robinhood have no basis.""

Altonaga previously dismissed a lawsuit alleging that Robinhood and other brokerages colluded with Citadel Securities LLC to halt a ""short squeeze"" that was causing billions of dollars of losses for hedge funds that had bet against the stocks retail investors championed. Citadel Securities and Robinhood have denied those allegations.
The judge allowed plaintiffs to file an amended version of that lawsuit. Another meme-stock lawsuit alleging Robinhood violated securities law is pending. Robinhood has sought to dismiss the claims.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Thursday increased the amount of time employees around the world can take off for vacation or caring for newborns and seriously ill loved ones. 
Google has long been known as a global trailblazer in workplace benefits. But unlike many companies in Silicon Valley, it does not offer unlimited paid time off. Employees also have grown frustrated during the pandemic about long work hours, without being able to enjoy free meals and other Google office perks.
Employees will now receive a minimum of 20 paid vacation days annually, up from 15 days.
Google's chief people officer, Fiona Cicconi, said in a statement that the increased leave aims ""to support our employees at every stage of their lives and that means providing extraordinary benefits.""

Google said parents who give birth can take up to 24 weeks off compared with 18 previously. All other parents will have up to 18 weeks of leave, up from 12.
It also will double carer's leave to look after seriously ill loved ones to eight weeks.

PARIS (Reuters) -The world's largest luxury goods conglomerate LVMH sees soaring demand for its fashion, handbags and jewellery continuing in 2022 after shoppers snapped up high-end wares over the holiday season.
LVMH, which owns brands spanning Hennessy cognac to cosmetics retailer Sephora, said on Thursday fourth-quarter sales growth accelerated, reaching 20.04 billion euros ($22.34 billion) overall, with growth led by the French group's biggest earners Louis Vuitton and Dior.
The luxury labels propelled a 28% rise in sales of LVMH's largest division, fashion and leather goods, on a like-for-like basis, beating analyst expectations for 16% growth. Revenues for the business in the last three months of last year came in 51% above their 2019, pre-pandemic level, the group said.
All divisions posted double-digit growth, percentage-wise, with the fastest pace marked by the specialised distribution division, which includes Sephora, booking a 30% revenue rise over the quarter as consumers flocked to stores for holiday purchases at the end of the year.
""Following stronger than expected reporting from competitors like Burberry, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Richemont earlier in the month, expectations were high going into the results. This results report did not disappoint even on the elevated expectations,"" said Christopher Rossbach, manager of the World Stars Global Equity Fund and CIO of J. Stern & Co.
On top of booming sales in Asia, LVMH singled out the United States as its best-performing single country for sales, accounting for 26% of the total in 2021 - a factor which some analysts say will add to the group's strengths this year, especially since it bought jeweller Tiffany. 
""Its greater exposure to the U.S. market – via the weight of Louis Vuitton and Sephora, disproportionate growth at Dior and now the integration of Tiffany – is a clear positive in our mind,"" said HSBC in a note.
LVMH billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said strong momentum for the group continued in January, adding LVMH could increase prices to protect margins in the current inflationary environment. 
He said that Tiffany, whose acquisition was completed a year ago, posted a record year in terms of sales and profit, even though its main flagship store in New York was closed for renovation throughout 2021. It's due to reopen this year.
The luxury industry has rebounded strongly from the coronavirus crisis, lifted by pent up demand from consumers after months of lockdowns and store closures. 

LVMH has tapped into this appetite for high end goods, and gained ground on rivals with active marketing campaigns targeting local consumers rather than relying on deep pocketed tourists. Its fashion and leather goods increased market share to around 21% compared to 16% before the pandemic, according to UBS forecasts.

Speaking after the group reported strong results for 2021, Arnault said he expected demand for luxury goods to remain solid this year, noting however that the rise in inflationary pressures was seen by some observers as cause for concern.

""We have to remain reasonable,"" he told analysts and reporters when asked about expected increase in prices for LVMH's products this year.
Arnault added that the group was still in ""mourning"" after the sudden death of Louis Vuitton's star designer Virgil Abloh last November, and did not want to talk about succession plans for the label for the time being.

Pershing's founder and CEO, Bill Ackman, said that makes them a top 20 shareholder in the streaming giant.
""The opportunity to acquire Netflix at an attractive valuation emerged when investors reacted negatively to the recent quarter's subscriber growth and management's short-term guidance. Netflix's substantial stock price decline was further exacerbated by recent market volatility,"" read the letter.
Ackman cited Netflix's ""highly favorable characteristics,"" which included its subscription-based, highly recurring revenue, its management team, industry-leading content, pricing power, substantial margin expansion and improving free cash flow as reasons for the investment.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) have swapped proposals as they work toward possibly ending a nearly 10-month lockout by the company of Beaumont, Texas, refinery workers, Exxon said on Thursday.
The company did not offer details about either offer made at a meeting on Wednesday. It did say it rejected the proposal from USW local 13-243 in Beaumont during the meeting, which was the 55th between the two sides ""and provided a new counter offer which included two, union-requested changes.""
A spokesperson for the USW was not immediately available on Thursday to comment.
Both sides are waiting for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to decide on charges filed by the USW that Exxon is using the lockout, which began on May 1, to force the removal of the union from the 369,024 barrel-per-day refinery and an adjoining lubricating oil plant. 
On Dec. 29, the NLRB impounded ballots cast between November and December by over 600 USW members in a vote on the union's removal.

Exxon has said the lockout will end when either a contract that meets its goals is accepted or the union is removed. The company has said its contract proposals would enable it to be competitive in even low-margin environments.
USW 13-243 members rejected Exxon's offer in October because it would remove a long-standing, key provision that allows workers a say over job assignments and would split the refinery workers from lubrication plant employees.

TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) -Renault and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) will work more closely together to make electric cars, they said on Thursday, as they detailed a $26 billion investment plan over the next five years to stay competitive in the switch to cleaner driving. 
The two-decade old alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF), said it would increase the number of common platforms for electric vehicles (EV) to five from four. 
They will build a combined EV line-up of 35 vehicles by 2030, the companies said, adding that by 2026 four fifths of their models would share common platforms, up from 60% now.
Rocked by the 2018 ouster of alliance founder and chairman Carlos Ghosn amid a financial scandal, the companies have pledged to strengthen their ties by pooling more resources. 
""The alliance will hold its place among the world automotive leaders,"" Alliance Operating Board Chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, said during an online presentation.
But it faces competition from bigger carmakers with deeper pockets, such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), which in December pledged to spend $70 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-says-have-30-battery-electric-line-up-vehicles-by-2030-2021-12-14 to electrify its fleet, as well as EV specialists such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

""We are not a second division player when we come together,"" Renault CEO Luca de Meo said during the presentation.
SCALE
To power the new EVs, the partners said they planned to secure 220 gigawatt (GWh) hours of battery production capacity by 2030, providing greater scale that would allow them to halve battery costs by 2026 and reduce them by 65% by 2028. They did not give details on how the capacity would be secured. 
The money promised on Thursday comes from funding announced last year. 
In June, Renault unveiled a five-year 10 billion euro EV strategy https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/renault-raises-targets-share-electric-vehicles-2021-06-30 with a plan to launch 10 models and to have EVs account for 90% of all models by 2030. 
Nissan said in November it would spend 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over five years to accelerate vehicle electrification, including on EVs and hybrid gasoline-electric cars. 
Japan's No. 3 carmaker plans to launch 23 electrified vehicles by 2030, including 15 pure EVs. It has also said it wants to reduce lithium-ion battery costs by 65% within eight years and introduce potentially game-changing all solid-state batteries by March 2029.
Nissan said on Thursday it planned to replace its Micra car in Europe with a new EV using one of the common platforms.
Holding the three-way alliance together is a cross-shareholding relationship, with Renault owning 43.4% of Nissan, which in turn has a 15% non-voting stake in the French car company and a third of Mitsubishi Motors' stock.
Senard declined to comment when asked whether the partners might rebalance the relationship by changing those holdings.
A new structure has been expected by financial markets. Renault has been in the dominant position since it bailed out Nissan two decades ago, but is now smaller by sales than its Japanese partner.

""Life is long and we should never be impatient on that kind of subject,"" said Senard

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 12:31PM ET</span>",Blackstone reports record fourth-quarter earnings,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -Blackstone Inc on Thursday said distributable earnings rose by 55% to a record high, as the world's largest manager of alternative assets took advantage of rising markets to sell assets for top dollar.
Private equity dealmaking pushed global mergers and acquisition activity to an all-time high in 2021, fueled by an abundance of cheap capital and soaring corporate valuations.
But prospects for M&A activity are more uncertain this year, with public markets paring back recent gains amid rising inflation, proposed interest rate hikes, and an end to the Federal Reserve's bond buying program, which was reaffirmed by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a speech on Wednesday.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) said its outlook remains positive even in the current environment because of the quality of its portfolios, the long duration of its capital, and the scale of its fundraising.
""It's possible as markets trade off a lot, you'll see some slowdown. But I would say overall, we're continuing to see very positive momentum, and our outlook is quite good,"" Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said during a call with analysts on Thursday.
RECORD EARNINGS
Blackstone said its distributable earnings, which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, surged to a record $2.3 billion from $1.7 billion a year earlier. That resulted in distributable earnings per share of $1.71, which surpassed the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $1.37, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
During the quarter, Blackstone said it spent a record $65.8 billion to acquire new assets across its real estate, credit, private equity, hedge funds portfolios. 
Those deals included a $5.1 billion purchase of affordable housing units from American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), the acquisition of majority stake in garage-door equipment maker Chamberlain Group, and the take-private of Canada's WPT Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust.
Blackstone said it generated $21 billion from cashing out investments, including the sale of sub-prime auto lender Exeter Finance to private equity firm Warburg Pincus and the divestment of jeweler Diamond Direct to Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) Ltd in a $490 million transaction.
Blackstone's private equity funds appreciated by 4.8% in the quarter, compared with a 10.7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 12% and 7.2%, respectively.
Total assets under management rose to a record $881 billion, up 21% from the $730.7 billion posted three months earlier owing to a record amount of fundraising.

As a result, Blackstone said it now expects to reach its goal of managing $1 trillion in assets this year, much earlier than a previously announced target of 2026. Its unspent capital stood at $135.8 billion.
Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of $1.45 per share.

The leather goods maker said on Thursday 2021 revenues totalled 1.136 billion euros ($1.27 billion), in line with a Refinitiv consensus of 1.135 billion euros. 
In the fourth quarter sales grew by 23.5% at constant exchange rates, thanks to a strong performance in the United States and booming online revenues. 
Most luxury groups have already reached, if not exceeded, pre-COVID levels, showing the challenge facing Ferragamo's new Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti, who started at the Florentine group this month after 4-1/2 years at the helm of Burberry. 
The pandemic crisis hit just as family-owned Ferragamo strived to rejuvenate a brand famous for the shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn.
In 2019, before the health crisis, Ferragamo posted sales of 1.377 billion euros in sales, but lockdown measures and a collapse in tourism led to a 33% revenue drop in 2020 for a group that is more exposed than rivals to travel spending.

Gobbetti's main task will be to step up its turnaround efforts and revitalise the brand with a new fashion director after British designer Paul Andrew left in April. (This story corrects 2020 sales drop to 33% from 20% in paragraph six)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Public companies in the United States would be required to disclose how the pay of their top executives squares with their overall performance under a Securities and Exchange Commission rule proposed on Thursday.
The pay-versus-performance measure, which builds on a 2015 SEC proposal https://www.reuters.com/article/sec-companies-compensation/u-s-sec-proposes-disclosure-rules-on-executive-pay-versus-performance-idUSL1N0XQ23920150429 mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, calls for companies to disclose performance measures beyond total shareholder return and to list the five most important performance measures used to determine compensation actually paid to executives.
Wednesday's rule, which must first receive public consultation before it can take effect, also asks whether companies should spell out whether pretax net income and net income would be useful additional financial metrics.
""This proposed rule would strengthen the transparency and quality of executive compensation disclosure,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler, adding that the agency ""has long recognized the value of information on executive compensation to investors.""
The move also comes amid a push by President Joe Biden's administration to force listed companies to review working conditions, pay equity, hiring and retention policies.
It follows complaints by investor and employee advocates who have long wanted more details on how listed companies incentivize its labor force across all levels, including a company's top executive.

Advocates argue that the best-paid CEOs do not necessarily run the best-performing companies. Industry groups have said the approach by the SEC could ultimately confuse investors.
Wednesday's measure would also solicit additional feedback on the agency's 2015 proposal, which called for companies to provide a table in their proxy statements that contains the total compensation actually paid to their principal executives, the total shareholder return on an annual basis, and the shareholder return on an annual basis of peer group companies, among other things.

Investing.com — Software firm SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) said Thursday it is in a deal to acquire U.S. fintech company Taulia.
SAP said the move to acquire Taulia, a provider of working capital management solutions, aims to give companies better access to liquidity and improve their cash flows. 
SAP shares are down 6.6%.
Taulia was already an SAP partner, and more than 80% of its customer base, which includes Airbus, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), run an SAP ERP system. 
The California-based company will remain independent with its own brand within the SAP Group. Its CEO Cédric Bru will stay on in the role, while SAP CFO Luka Mucic will become chairman of the board.
“Taulia strengthens our portfolio and adds value to a point that is key to every company: financial flexibility and stability. With that, they contribute to making supply chains more resilient,” SAP CFO Luka Mucic said. 
Adding: “By combining the deep working capital management expertise of Taulia with SAP’s broad CFO solution portfolio and the integration into our core business software and Business Network solutions, we are well positioned to become a leader in working capital management.""
Earlier in the day, SAP reported fourth-quarter results, with revenue boosted by growth in its cloud business. Total revenue rose to 7.98 billion euros ($9 billion) from 7.54 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company sees cloud revenue in 2022 rising by between 23% to 26%."

(Reuters) -McDonald's Corp missed revenue and profit expectations on Thursday, as higher costs and tepid sales in its over 4,500 restaurants in Australia and China due to pandemic-led curbs ate into gains from growth in the United States in the fourth quarter.
Operating costs rose 14% to $3.61 billion as supply chain bottlenecks led the world's largest burger chain to spend more for ingredients such as chicken and beef, as well as packaging material. 
U.S. food and paper costs rose 4% in 2021 - a level the company expects to roughly double in 2022, it said.
""A surge in COVID-19 cases and a return of restrictions in many of our markets are creating uncertainty around the world, exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain delays,"" Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said on an earnings call.
In the United States, the company's biggest market, about 20% of U.S. restaurants have shuttered their seating areas because of staff shortages or local COVID-19 outbreaks and about 1% of U.S. stores are operating with reduced hours.
Shares fell slightly after the market opened. On a per share basis, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) earned $2.23, missing analysts' average estimate of $2.34.
Sales in China contracted after some cities banned dining in restaurants to control fresh pandemic outbreaks ahead of the February Winter Olympics. In Australia, sales growth remained muted compared to a year earlier.
However, the Chicago-based chain's U.S. same-store sales increased 7.5% compared to analysts' estimate of a 6.8% rise, thanks to the launch of special menu items such as McRib, celebrity promotions, loyalty program-driven growth in digital sales and menu price increases of about 6% in 2021.

Sales growth in Italy, Germany, France and the United Kingdom also helped boost global revenue by 13% to $6.01 billion in the three months ending Dec. 31, just shy of a market expectation of $6.03 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Global same-store sales jumped 12.3%, compared with Wall Street estimates of a 10.73% rise.

(Reuters) -Dow Inc on Thursday forecast better-than-expected sales for the current quarter after fourth-quarter results beat estimates, helped by higher prices for its products as supplies remained tight amid strong demand.
Shares of the company, which makes chemicals used in a range of products including food packaging, mattresses, textiles and electronics, rose as much as 6.5% to $60.97.
High demand as economies recover from the impact of COVID-19 along with supply-chain pressures, pandemic-related logistical constraints and weather-related outages at plants have allowed the company to boost prices. 
Prices climbed 39% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while volumes fell 4%.
Dow forecast first-quarter sales between $14 billion and $14.5 billion, above analysts' estimates of $12.84 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data, as industrial production and sustained consumer spending point to growing demand.
Logistical constraints are expected to ease throughout the year, helping clear elevated order backlogs and meet pent-up customer demand, Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider added that while the Omicron variant resulted in some near-term disruption, the company does not expect any significant affect on its current recovery path. 
However, margins are likely to moderate in 2022 as supply improves, he added, forecasting a $275 million hit to first-quarter margins compared with the fourth quarter. 
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Aleksey Yefremov said that while demand is largely intact for Dow's end-markets, commodity margins are ""really challenged"".
""Ultimately, the earnings of the fourth quarter of 2022 are going to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2021.""

Dow net operating income more than doubled to $1.6 billion, while earnings per share of $2.15 beat estimates of $2.04.
Sales rose 34.2% to $14.37 billion and topped estimates of $14.31 billion. However, this marked the first sequential decline in Dow's revenue in six quarters.

The new feature turns the iPhone itself into a payment terminal and will let merchants accept fees with the tap of a credit card or another iPhone onto the back of their device, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Shares of Block fell 3.6% to $106.98 in early trading on Thursday.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been working on the new feature since 2020 when it paid about $100 million for Canadian startup Mobeewave, which enables smartphones to accept payments with the tap of a credit card, Bloomberg reported. 
The system will likely use the iPhone's near field communications chip that is currently used for Apple Pay, according to the report.
""This effectively allows Apple to bypass rolling out new hardware because a significant amount of customers already carry it (iPhones) in their pocket,"" Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said. 
Purk, however, added that unless Apple can offer a cheaper product and an easier platform, some business owners may be reluctant to switch.
Square currently charges $299 for its device and a fee of 2.6% plus 10 cents for every transaction.
If the iPhone maker keeps its new service exclusive to its apps or payments system, it would bypass Square's services that are used widely by small businesses. It could also affect other point-of-sale machine makers such as Verifone and Ingenico.

Apple declined to comment on the report.
The company has been beefing up its fintech services. It launched its own credit card https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/moments/2019-apple-card.html with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in 2019 and is reportedly working on a ""buy, pay later"" service https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-goldman-sachs-planning-buy-now-pay-later-service-bloomberg-news-2021-07-13.

Investing.com – Virgin Orbit stock (NASDAQ:VORB) soared more than 20% Thursday as the company secured a five-year $300 million NASA contract to do launches for the space agency.
The stock touched the day’s high of $10.24 on Thursday, though trading halted for a time because of extreme volatility.
The contract calls upon the Richard Branson-founded company to launch an indefinite number of satellites under a fixed price. According to the company, it enables more efficient launch timelines and mission-tailored orbits.
The order provides a platform for NASA to more easily contract for flights on Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rocket.
The company has already launched 13 satellites to space for NASA through programs like the Venture Class Launch Services program and the CubeSat Launch Initiative – exercises aimed at transporting smaller payloads into low-Earth orbits.
The contract for Virgin Orbit is part of NASA’s attempts to lower cost of launches and have more private sector participation.
Earlier this month, Virgin Orbit put seven satellites in low orbit, its third successful launch in under 12 months.
The company is targeting five more missions this year, including two in the summer from Cornwall, U.K., which will be the company’s first international foray. Virgin plans to launch from Japan as soon as 2023 and eventually to make flights from Guam and Brazil, according to Bloomberg.

Repaying the loan potentially frees Stellantis from a set of conditions that Rome attached to it, including preserving jobs at its Italian operations, timely paying suppliers that are crucial for local plants or financing domestic investments, in particular for electric vehicles.
The repayment is imminent, one of the sources said.
The news was initially reported by Bloomberg.
The loan, which carries a three-year maturity, was paid in June 2020 to Fiat Chrysler's (FCA) Italian unit by the country's top lender Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), with credit export agency SACE providing a guarantee on 80% of its amount.
The loan stirred controversy in Italy because Fiat Chrysler, which in recent years has moved its legal headquarters to the Netherlands, was at the time working to merge with French rival PSA, in a deal which included the payment of a large cash dividend to its shareholders.
Rome, however, agreed to back the loan to assure cash to one of the country's largest employers, at a time when the COVID pandemic and consequent lockdown measures had almost completely frozen the automotive market. 
The automotive industry in Italy employs 278,000 direct and indirect workers and accounts for 6.2% of the country's gross domestic product, according to data provided by automotive lobby ANFIA.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Whole Foods unit can be sued over the refusal to hire a convicted murderer who claimed to be rehabilitated after nearly 23 years in prison.
In a Wednesday night decision, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan said Henry Franklin could pursue a proposed class action after being turned down for a grocery delivery job at Cornucopia Logistics, which serves Amazon and Whole Foods.
Amazon determined after a background check that Franklin had lied on his April 2019 job application by answering ""no"" when asked if he had a criminal record.
New York law bars employers from rejecting job applicants based on their criminal histories unless the crimes relate directly to the jobs sought, or hirings would pose an unreasonable risk to the public.
Without ruling on the merits, Caproni said the defendants failed to show that either exception applied, adding that Franklin ""has adequately alleged that he is rehabilitated and no longer poses a threat to the public.""
She also said she was ""sympathetic to defendants' likely position that they do not want a convicted murderer delivering groceries to their customers' homes.""
The defendants and their lawyers did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Franklin's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Amazon and Whole Foods had argued that Franklin's lie was reason enough turn him down, and he lacked standing to sue them because neither was his ""prospective"" employer.
Caproni called Franklin's pleading on the latter issue ""barely"" sufficient.
According to court papers, Franklin was convicted of second-degree murder in June 1995 and paroled in June 2018.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Amazon and Whole Foods job applicants in New York state and New York City with criminal records.
The case is Franklin v Whole Foods Market Group Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-04935.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is ramping up spending on its Peacock streaming service, executives said on Thursday, aiming to catch up to big media rivals in the global battle for viewers. 
Unlike the majority of its rivals, Peacock offers a free, ad-supported version and two paid options: a $5-per-month tier with “light ads” and an ad-free version costing $10 per month. 
In a call with investors on Thursday, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the “vast majority” of Peacock’s paid subscribers choose the $5 tier over the $10 tier. Going forward, the company will focus its strategy around the ad-supported tiers.
It is doubling Peacock content spend to $3 billion in 2022 and plans to increase domestic content spend for Peacock to $5 billion over the next couple of years, an additional investment that will result in an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss of roughly $2.5 billion. It plans to fund that investment out of NBCUniversal’s cash flows.
In the fourth quarter, Comcast brought in $778 million in revenue and lost $1.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA related to Peacock, over double the $663 million in adjusted EBITDA it lost in 2020. 
The company had previously committed to spending $2 billion on Peacock content in the streaming service’s first two years.
Comcast reported that Peacock had 24.5 million monthly active U.S. accounts at the end of the year, up from over 20 million at the end of July, 9 million of which are paid subscribers. Comcast defines that metric as the number of households that watched content on Peacock during the month. 
Growth in Comcast's NBCUniversal division helped the company's fourth-quarter revenue beat Wall Street expectations. Total revenue rose 9.5% to $30.34 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $29.61 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company posted a 4.5% rise in cable revenue to $16.41 billion. It grew overall cable customer relationships, including broadband, video, voice and other services, 3.3% to 34.2 million accounts. 
However, it only gained 212,000 broadband customers in the latest quarter, down 60.6% from the same period last year, when the company benefited from demand as the pandemic caused people to work from and seek entertainment at home. Comcast's NBCUniversal media unit saw a 25.6% rise in revenue, driven by a recovery in the company's theme parks division. The division had the most profitable fourth quarter in NBCUniversal's history because domestic tourists spent more when they visited.
Net income attributable to Comcast fell to $3.06 billion, or 66 cents per share in the fourth quarter, from $3.38 billion or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Comcast posted an adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents, above expectations for 73 cents.

The company increased its share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. 
Shares of the company were down 5.4% at $45.81 on Thursday.

Investing.com – Levi Strauss stock (NYSE:LEVI) soared 15% Thursday as a stronger-than-expected sales outlook and price hikes that boosted results impressed traders.
The company was able to weather the tough market conditions and improved its dividend when most peers have struggled. The apparel-maker expects 2022 revenue to come in between $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion, nearly 13% higher at the top end. Adjusted profit per share is seen in the range of $1.50 to $1.56.
The optimistic outlook comes even as the company expects supply-chain disruptions to continue for the rest of the year.
According to Bloomberg, Levi tried to counter the inflationary headwinds by raising prices by about 10% in the fourth quarter that ended Nov. 28.
Price hikes helped fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin expand 3.5 percentage points to 58.1%, excluding Covid-19 and acquisition-related charges. The increased profit margin also reflects a higher proportion of sales in the direct-to-consumer, lower promotions, and a higher share of full price sales, according to the company.
Net revenue in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $1.7 billion. Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to 41 cents, helped by lower restructuring charges.

Investing.com — Google (Alphabet Inc) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares rose 2.4% on Thursday after CNBC reported the tech giant has formed a division to build a business around blockchain applications.
The move is to grow the company's prospects in industries such as retail and healthcare, with CNBC adding that success could help the company move away from just advertising and build up its computing and storage services business.
Google's head of strategy for digital assets at its cloud unit, Richard Widmann said the cloud group plans to hire various blockchain experts.
CNBC quoted Widmann explaining that there are ""things we can do to reduce the frictions some customers have with respect to paying for centralized cloud utilizing cryptocurrencies."" 
Last week, Bloomberg reported that Shivakumar Venkataraman, an engineering vice president for Google, would lead the blockchain unit. Meanwhile, earlier this week it reported that YouTube is exploring NFT features for video creators."

Investing.com – McDonald’s stock (NYSE:MCD) fell 1% Thursday after pandemic-led higher costs and temporary store closures kept the company’s fourth-quarter sales and earnings behind estimates.
""Covid-19 continued to result in varying levels of government restrictions on restaurant operating hours, limited dine-in capacity and, in some cases, dining room closures,"" McDonald's said.
Restrictions were tightest in key markets such as China, Australia and India.
Sales in China contracted as some cities banned dining in restaurants to control fresh Covid outbreaks ahead of February’s Winter Olympics in Beijing. Australia revenue was relatively flat.
Sales were higher in the U.S., U.K. and other European markets such as Italy, Germany and France.
Price hikes and launch of special menu items like McRib and Crispy Chicken Sandwich led comparable sales higher by 7.5% in U.S, its biggest market. This compares with 5.5% increases in the 2020 December quarter.
On a full-year basis, operating costs surged 14%, matching the annual growth in revenue as the company had to raise its wages to attract and retain workers at a time of severe labor crunch.
McDonald’s expects its operating margin in 2022 to be in the low- to mid-40% range, compared with 43.4% last year, excluding some items, according to Bloomberg.
Overall revenue in the fourth quarter rose 13%, to $6 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose 31% to $2.23, boosted by gains from the sale of McDonald’s Japan stock.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 09:41AM ET</span>","New EV owners resist gasoline cars, survey shows","(Reuters) - First-time owners of electric vehicles were reluctant to switch back to gasoline-fueled cars even as concerns continued to loom about the availability of charging infrastructure, a report from J.D. Power showed on Thursday.
Sales of EVs in the United States jumped to a record high earlier this month with 434,879 new units on the road, however, demand for their hybrid counterparts remained strong as many customers withdrew from EVs due to higher prices, limited driving range and fewer charging stations than required.
""We know from our research that many consumers have concerns during the purchase consideration process with aspects like battery range and vehicle charging,"" said Brent Gruber, senior director of global automotive at J.D. Power. 
""However, once someone has purchased a BEV, they're pretty much hooked."" 
The 2022 U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) ownership study showed that satisfaction among owners who are new to BEVs averaged 754 (on a 1,000-point scale), which is comparable to 766 among BEV veterans (those who have owned a BEV prior to their current one). 

The study found that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3 ranked highest overall and highest in the premium BEV segment with a score of 777. The Kia Niro EV ranked highest in the mass market BEV segment for a second consecutive year with a score of 744.
The study took into consideration factors including accuracy of stated battery range, availability of public charging stations, cost of ownership, driving enjoyment, ease of home charging, interior and exterior styling, safety and technology features, service experience, and vehicle quality and reliability.

1559,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 09:36AM ET</span>",Now It’s Apple’s Turn to Try and Boost Tech Stocks After Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s earnings Thursday now carry the burden of trying to turn the tide for technology stocks after the Federal Reserve’s signal of faster rate hikes made investors skittish.
Anything less than a top-notch earnings beat has the potential to disappoint shareholders as the stock has been outperforming peers so far this year, falling just 10% while the Nasdaq 100 Index is 13% lower. That would also put Apple further away from being the first $3 trillion company -- a milestone that was in touching distance just a few weeks back.
“The risk is that the current market backdrop appears to be only rewarding near flawless execution and results,” said Cowen analyst Krish Sankar. The Nasdaq’s rout is the worst-ever start to the year for the tech-heavy benchmark.
The iPhone maker’s ability to navigate supply chains roiled by a parts shortage and Covid-19 will be an area of focus, analysts say. Those snags cost Apple about $6 billion in lost sales in its fiscal fourth quarter and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook warned at the time that the toll would be even greater in the first quarter. And that was before the omicron variant sent infections soaring worldwide. 
With predictions for rising interest rates putting pressure on valuations, it’s critical that technology companies beat earnings estimates that are rising, according to DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas. “Flat/middling earnings revisions is not enough.”
Tesla’s earnings Wednesday are a good example of how a regular beat alone might not get rewarded. The electric-car maker beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, excluding some items, but the stock fell as much as 2% after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said supply chain shortages are hampering sales.
The stakes appear to be high as Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up 15% since a low on Oct. 4, suggesting any upside on the first-quarter results is already priced in. Moreover, its projected earnings of $1.90 a share on revenue of $119.1 billion for the December quarter is a significant downshift from last year’s booming growth. 
Of course, there is always the potential for upside.  Microsoft Corp .'s  (NASDAQ:MSFT) strong earnings this week lifted a group of beaten-down software stocks Wednesday -- at least until Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted the market with his more hawkish tone.
Tech Chart of the Day
The Hang Seng Tech Index tumbled 3.8% in Hong Kong to near an all-time low after the Fed decision. The index that has been roiled by Beijing’s regulatory crackdowns over the past year is now caught in a broad selloff in tech stocks.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 09:30AM ET</span>",Altice calls off Portugal sale over valuation row with buyout funds - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Sergio Goncalves
LONDON (Reuters) - Altice Europe NV has ditched a plan to sell its Portuguese business after private equity bids failed to meet price expectations, leaving founder Patrick Drahi with no viable exit for the country's largest telecoms firm, three sources told Reuters.
Altice was locked in a valuation row with buyout funds EQT (NYSE:EQT) and CVC Capital Partners in December as non-binding proposals by two of Europe's biggest investment firms came well below a 7 billion euro ($7.86 billion) threshold that Drahi had set to negotiate a deal, the sources said.
The highest indicative bid came in at just above 6 billion euros and included a premium based on Altice Portugal's market dominance, one of the sources said.
Lack of competitive tension in the discussions was a key factor as most industry buyers including Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) had walked away while buyout funds refused to pay up for a business which had partly sold its fibre network and other key infrastructure over the years, the sources said.
EQT and CVC declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Altice said the company's Portuguese assets ""were not for sale and are not for sale"". Altice had previously denied discussions to sell the unit.
Altice hired Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) last year to test market appetite for its Portuguese business but the telecoms firm, which has the bulk of its operations in France, never launched a formal auction process as price expectations immediately proved challenging for most bidders.
The talks were aborted between late December and early January, with the bidders notified that the sale had been cancelled ""in the same informal way it was launched"", the first source said.
Meanwhile, Altice has shifted its focus to Britain with its newly-established UK vehicle raising its stake in BT to 18 per cent in December - a move that triggered a defensive response from the British government.
""Altice needs to sell assets to focus more on other markets, such as Britain,"" the source said.

""The company has a package of assets which are constantly being reviewed ahead of a possible sale and the Portuguese unit was - and still is - part of it.""

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 09:26AM ET</span>",What Olympics? Advertisers lie low ahead of Beijing Winter Games,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -Just a week before the opening ceremony of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, U.S. television viewers can be forgiven for forgetting the date, or even that it is taking place in Beijing, China.
Unlike any Games in recent memory, the nearly 20 official international and national Olympic sponsors have laid low, ducking the press and viewers by holding back on the advertising blitz that typically kicks off months ahead the ""let the Games begin"" pronouncement. 
By Wednesday, only two spots had launched, both of which focus on athletes with no mention of the host country, with which the United States is feuding on diplomatic and economic fronts.
Over the course of the Games, ad agency executives and advertisers told Reuters that viewers should expect ads to continue to downplay the location and ignore any hint of politics to avoid drawing attention to geopolitical conflict and the hot glare of the Chinese government.
Corporate sponsors and advertisers for the Beijing Olympics, which begin on Feb. 4 and run through Feb. 20, have come under fire for what human rights groups say is the enabling of China’s alleged abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the country. China denies those allegations.
Global Olympic sponsors were grilled by a bipartisan congressional panel in July, which accused the companies of putting profits ahead of accusations of genocide in China.
“The halo is tarnished,” said Mark DiMassimo, founder of New York-based ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein, which represents brands that are not official sponsors but plan to air commercials during the Olympics.
He said his clients decided to strip from their campaigns mentions of traditional Olympic themes - friendly competition, global unity and good sportsmanship - shortly after the Biden administration announced a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics last month.
Bridgestone Corp, an official sponsor of the International Olympic Committee, this month began airing a commercial featuring U.S. figure skater Nathan Chen, an Asian American, who advocates for authentic representation in skating, ""no matter who you are or where you come from.""
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), the official airline of Team USA, is airing two commercials spotlighting skiers, snowboarders and figure skaters who defy gravity in their events.
German financial services firm Allianz (DE:ALVG) will have a film featuring winter athletes that will play on social media in the United States, a spokesperson said. Last year, Allianz filmed a short video about U.S. Paralympic athlete Matt Stutzman.
When Reuters asked the global and Team USA sponsors about marketing plans for the Olympics, only two responded, one of which declined to comment.
BIG DEPARTURE
This year’s response is a big departure from Olympics past, when advertisers crafted ads that embraced the spirit of the Games and honored the culture of the host country.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year aired a commercial for the Tokyo Olympics in which Japanese citizens showed famous parts of the city such as the Shibuya Crossing over a Teams call, sharing a piece of Tokyo for people who could not be there due to the pandemic. 
A Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co ad for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics featured animated birds stealing straws from Coke drinks to build a replica of the famed Bird’s Nest stadium. But that was then.
With the political controversy and the pandemic once again preventing spectators from traveling to the Games, viewers this time around can expect to see fewer mentions of the host city, said Jeremy Carey, managing director of ad agency Optimum Sports, a unit of Omnicom Media Group.
“It’s a challenge, quite frankly,” he said. “The connection isn’t as prevalent as it would normally be.”
Focusing on the athletes competing on the global stage is considered the safest strategy for brands, experts said.

“We’re trying to steer clear of the geopolitical implications around (the Olympics),” said Chris Brandt, chief marketing officer at  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). Chipotle will run ads during the Olympics promoting “real food for real athletes,” and feature the preferred orders of competitors like U.S. ice hockey player Hilary Knight.
Any attempt for a brand to associate themselves with the Beijing Olympics could backfire, DiMassimo said. “You just don’t know. You put (the commercial) on, and it might explode.”

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 08:55AM ET</span>",Dealmaking helps Deutsche Bank land biggest profit in a decade,"By Tom Sims and Frank Siebelt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank delivered its most profitable year in a decade on the back of a dealmaking bonanza, strengthening Chief Executive Christian Sewing's hand as he fine tunes a new strategy and tackles costly competition for talent.
Analysts had forecast a fourth quarter loss and shares in Germany's largest bank rose by more than 5% after the surprise finale to 2021, which marked the second straight annual profit following years of losses. 
Deutsche had to pay up to keep its traders and dealmakers on board, with compensation at its investment bank soaring 30% in the final quarter. 
Bank executives said they were worried about an ""intense war"" for talent and Deutsche has a long way to go to cut expenses, even as investment bank revenue may decline this year.
Nevertheless, the results represent a milestone for Sewing, who was promoted to the top job in 2018 to turn Deutsche around after a series of embarrassing and costly regulatory failings.
""You all know how turbulent the years between 2016 and 2018 were for our bank. Back then, we seemed to have entered a downward spiral,"" Sewing told reporters on Thursday. 
""The downward spiral turned into an upward spiral,"" he said.
Deutsche's shares, which are up by more than 30% over the past year, were 5.1% higher at 1213 GMT after it said net profit attributable to shareholders was 145 million euros ($163 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31. 
That compared with a profit of 51 million euros a year earlier and contrasted with analyst expectations for a loss of around 130 million euros.
The fourth quarter was the sixth consecutive in the black, the bank's longest positive streak since 2012. 
Deutsche made a profit of 1.94 billion euros in 2021, up from 113 million euros a year earlier, although it has still lost more than 10 billion euros over the past decade. 
Regulators are still keeping a close eye on the bank, one of the most important for the global financial system.
Sewing confirmed Deutsche was on track to achieve a key profitability target in 2022, a return on tangible equity of 8% that many analysts have forecast the bank will miss.
Analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which has a sell rating on Deutsche, said the bank was ""overly optimistic"" and that it did not see anything in the fourth quarter to change this view. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which has an overweight rating, said the results were mixed, but the ""future is going in the right direction.""
Deutsche is far from its goal of a cost-to-income ratio of 70% by the end of 2022. It stood at 94.3% in the fourth quarter.
On the whole, investors expect Deutsche to deliver profits in 2022 and 2023, consensus forecasts show.
Sewing said the March strategy announcements would be an evolution of the bank's current stance, focusing on growth. 
The question of a possible tie-up with another lender has been in the air since Deutsche ended merger talks in 2019 with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). But Sewing said he wasn't thinking about mergers and acquisitions for 2022.
TALENT WAR
Once a thorn in Deutsche's side, the investment bank has become an important revenue generator, benefiting from a pandemic-induced trading boom and a wave of dealmaking that has lifted banks across Wall Street.
Revenue at the unit rose 1% to 1.913 billion euros in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. 
The investment bank's advisory business stood out, with revenue surging 156%.
Revenue for fixed-income and currency trading, one of the bank's largest divisions, fell 14% from a strong period a year earlier as markets calmed from their pandemic trading frenzy. That was in line with falls at U.S. competitors.
Some of the big U.S. banks' fourth-quarter results have disappointed investors partly because of ballooning expenses, hurting profit growth. 
The 30% increase in compensation and benefits at Deutsche's investment banking unit from a year earlier was greater than the average 10% gain for the bank as a whole, a sign it faces pressure to retain talent as the industry booms.
Those costs put a drag on the division's pretax profit, which at 319 million euros in the quarter was nearly half that of a year earlier.
Sewing said he was very concerned about the increasingly intense war for talent but he wanted to pay competitively.
""It is also clear that we cannot and do not want to avoid this competition, because we too want to have and keep the best talent in our bank,"" he said.
Sewing in 2019 announced 18,000 job cuts globally and the closure of some business lines in a bid to return to profit.
""Few observers were confident that we would be able to achieve such ambitious objectives within three and a half years,"" he said in a letter to staff. 
""Today we are proving that we keep our promises,"" he said.

Deutsche said on Wednesday it would pay a dividend for 2021, its first since 2018, and would also buy back shares.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) unit WhatsApp has been given until the end of February to explain changes to its privacy policy and whether this complies with EU consumer protection laws after complaints from consumer groups, the European Commission said on Thursday.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and eight of its members took their grievances to the EU executive and the European network of consumer authorities, saying WhatsApp was unfairly pressuring users to accept its new privacy policy which allows it to share some data with Facebook and other group firms.
EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said he shared the worries and has asked WhatsApp to clarify the policy and if it complies with EU consumer protection law.
""WhatsApp has until the end of February to come back to us with concrete commitments on how they will address our concerns,"" he said in a statement.
Areas of concern include whether the company provides sufficient information about its new terms of service and if its notifications prompting users to accept the new terms and privacy policy are fair.

The Commission said it was also concerned about the exchange of users' personal data between WhatsApp and third parties or other Facebook/Meta companies.
""We look forward to explaining to the European Commission how we protect our users' privacy in compliance with our obligations under EU law,"" a WhatsApp spokesperson said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday secured EU antitrust approval for its acquisition of U.S. customer service startup Kustomer after agreeing to provide rivals free access to its messaging channels for 10 years.
The European Commission said the pledge addressed competition concerns. Reuters reported last month that the world's largest social network would gained conditional EU clearance for the deal.
""Our decision today will ensure that innovative rivals and new entrants in the customer relationship management software market can effectively compete,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. 

Kustomer, which sells CRM software to businesses so they can communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram and other channels, would help Facebook scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp, which has seen usage soar during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A buying spree of startups by big companies has triggered concerns on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators worried about so-called killer acquisitions aimed at shutting down potential rivals before they are big enough to be a threat.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",Analysis-Investors look to prune portfolio risk as Fed hawkishness rules markets,"By David Randall and Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift is bolstering the case for investors looking to trim risk from their portfolios, as the U.S. central bank trains its guns on surging inflation while giving little indication that it will be swayed by the latest weakness in stocks. 
After the Fed's easy-money policies helped the S&P 500 soar from its March 2020 lows, investors must now contend with uncertainty on multiple fronts as the Fed gears up to raise interest rates and shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. 
“I continue to believe you have to be really conservative in your portfolio today,” said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income. “The Fed is going to have to see a few more cards on inflation and the economy, and the uncertainty is high.” 
At the conclusion of its latest monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed said it is likely to hike rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month in what Fed chief Jerome Powell pledged will be a sustained battle to tame inflation, which by some measures is at its highest levels since 1982. 
Fed funds futures, which track short-term rate expectations, are now pricing in a total of 4.4 rate increases this year, up from four expected hikes before Powell's press conference.
Markets had been jittery ahead of the meeting, with the S&P 500 down 8.6% for the year-to-date. That threatened to put the index on the path for its worst January performance in history, ahead of the 8.57% decline registered in January 2009, according to Ned Davis Research. 
For some investors, the uncertainty means that January’s market swings could be a preview of how asset prices will behave in coming months – a stark contrast from the becalmed markets many had grown used to since the Fed unleashed its massive stimulus programs nearly two years ago. 
In addition, questions over how the Fed will act appeared to have made investors more skittish about buying dips in the U.S. stock market, a strategy that proved lucrative over the last two years. 
""The Fed has really been the backstop for the market and now the Fed is starting to give the market a lot more rope,"" said Andy Kapyrin, co-chief investment officer at wealth manager RegentAtlantic, who has been shifting more of his firm's assets into value stocks -- shares of economically sensitive companies that would benefit from rising rates and shortening durations in his bond portfolios. 
RJ Gallo, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), believes the Fed will raise rates in 25 basis point increments for the remainder of the year starting at its March meeting. His firm has shortened the durations in its portfolios in anticipation that the yield of the 10-year Treasury bond will top 2% by the middle of the year, up from the current 1.77%. 
""The Fed and inflation are going to be the dominant forces for markets for the entire year of 2022,"" Gallo said. “Nothing has suggested this year that inflation will unwind, and the only way they have to address it is rate hikes and to shrink the balance sheet."" 
Powell's remarks on Wednesday sent yields on U.S. Treasuries higher and flattened the yield curve. Some investors have been nervous about the potential for the Fed to tighten so aggressively that it risks a sharp growth slowdown and have been focusing on the flattening yield curve as a potential warning.
""I think what you end up with is more persistent volatility, which shouldn't be a surprise - that tends to happen at the dawn of tightening cycles - and a flatter yield curve,"" said Steve Bartolini, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price’s New Income Fund, who said their portfolios were ""relatively conservative to begin with.""

Among the worst-hit assets in recent weeks have been tech stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite Index down 13.4% for the year. Cryptocurrencies have plunged, taking bitcoin down around 20% year-to-date. 
“We have to be cautious with regards to positioning for risk assets,” said Brian Quigley, portfolio manager at Vanguard Fixed Income Group. “I would not be surprised to see more equity weakness, see more widening in spreads of corporate bonds.”

(Reuters) -Northrop Grumman Corp missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates on Thursday as labor shortages and supply chain snarls hampered its ability to deliver components for defense products, including  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 jets.
The defense contractor's sales fell 15% in the final three months of 2021 to $8.64 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $8.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The drop was driven by a 25% decline in revenue from its aeronautics unit that makes the center fuselage for fighter jets and also reflected how the pandemic has hobbled manufacturers by disrupting supply chains.
Northrop (NYSE:NOC)'s shares fell 1.7% before the bell as its 2022 forecast suggested the supply chain pressure was likely to continue. The company expects sales of between $36.2 billion and $36.6 billion this year, below estimates of $37.03 billion. 
But its space systems business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 4% in the fourth quarter as countries ramped up investment in space exploration and satellite-based sensors.
Quarterly net earnings rose to $2.71 billion, or $17.14 per share, from $330 million, or $1.97 per share, a year ago, aided by a one-time gain on the sale of its IT services business.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $6 per share, beating estimates of $5.96 per share. 

Its total profit for 2021 more than doubled to $7 billion.
The results come after Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, encouraged by easing restrictions around the globe.

STOCKHOLM/BERLIN (Reuters) -SAP said on Thursday it has agreed to buy a majority stake in privately held U.S. fintech firm Taulia as the German business software group seeks to expand its presence in supply-chain financing and working capital management.
SAP, which makes software for managing business processes and gets much of its revenue in recurring form, said it was also looking at opportunities in the 'metaverse' - virtual online worlds where people can work, play and socialize.

""Soon you will see an announcement about what SAP will do around metaverse,"" Klein said.
SAP, which confirmed its preliminary fourth-quarter results on Thursday, forecast 2022 cloud revenue of 11.55-11.85 billion euros ($12.95-13.27 billion), up from 9.42 billion in 2021, as customers shift IT operations to the cloud. 
The deal with Taulia could help SAP win more business with customers by providing supply-chain financing.
Taulia works with financial institutions to allow suppliers that use its platform to receive early payments on their delivered goods and services, and the market has significantly increased due to the pandemic disrupting supply chains.
While SAP did not disclose the deal price, Klein said it was less than $1 billion. Taulia had raised more than $200 million from the likes of Trinity Ventures, Questmark Partner and Lakestar.
SAP is open to more acquisitions if they fit its portfolio, Klein added.

SAP's former CEO Léo Apotheker is an independent director at Taulia, and the companies have common customers such as Airbus, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Siemens Energy has stepped up efforts to explore a full integration of wind turbine business Siemens Gamesa, sources told Reuters, after profit warnings and share price slumps last week exposed flaws in the current ownership structure.
The company is currently working with advisers to look at options for how to best acquire the remaining 33% stake Siemens Energy does not yet own in Siemens Gamesa, two people familiar with the matter said.
Shares in Siemens Gamesa, the world's biggest maker of offshore wind turbines, rose as much as 7.7% on the news, while Siemens Energy rose as much as 3.1%.
Analysts at Citi, in a note following the news, said such a deal would bring most upside to Siemens Gamesa shares in the near-term.
""However, we would also see such a deal as potentially enabling a re-rating of Siemens Energy over the coming months from a greater clarity and simplification of the group's structure,"" they wrote.
Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch is under pressure to find a way to sort out the ownership structure inherited as part of a spin off from former parent Siemens in 2020 that gave him majority ownership in a business but no control.
A deal could materialise by summer, one of the people said, pointing to the risks to Siemens Energy, which has had to cut its outlook three times over the past nine months to reflect guidance downgrades at Spanish-listed Siemens Gamesa.
Siemens Energy is still weighing up the potential impact an acquisition would have on its balance sheet and investment grade rating, the people said, adding that one option would be to pay with stock, rather than cash, to avoid raising fresh capital.
No final decision has been made on the matter and there is no guarantee that a deal will happen, they added.
Siemens Energy and Siemens Gamesa declined to comment.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in a note this week said it saw a 50% chance that Siemens Energy would buy out Siemens Gamesa's minority shareholders at 21 euros per share, which would translate into a 4.7 billion euro ($5.3 billion) bid.
While that would represent a premium of around a third to the current price, Siemens Gamesa's shares have nearly halved over the past twelve months to their lowest since mid-2020, making a full takeover more affordable, the people said.

Siemens Gamesa, created in 2017 to better compete in the fast-growing but competitive wind turbine market, is facing supply chain issues and higher-than-expected costs related to a new product line in its onshore division.

In a letter dated Wednesday, the group told Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that part of the bill was ""ambiguous"" because Treasury could interpret who within the digital asset ecosystem qualifies as a ""broker"" beyond what Congress intended, and urged against ""a potentially expansive reading of the 'broker' definition."" 
""As nascent financial technologies develop, we must ensure requirements imposed on the digital asset ecosystem are both crafted and implemented in such a way to ensure the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation,"" the lawmakers, including Representatives Patrick McHenry, a Republican, and Tim Ryan, a Democrat, wrote.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report, which comes as the Biden administration is expected to unveil preliminary guidance regarding cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in coming days, according to Punchbowl.
Bloomberg News last week reported the administration was preparing to release its initial government-wide digital assets strategy as soon as February.
On Monday, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told CNBC new crypto related rules were coming soon. 
Digital assets are run by private actors, and some bank officials have urged U.S. regulators to clarify what would be a regulated digital asset, including crypto. 

U.S. regulators have been eyeing the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies over concerns it could put the financial system at risk if left unchecked. Top cryptocurrency company executives have urged against tough restrictions.
In November, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration reversed a Trump-era policy that gave banks permission to provide crypto custody services, with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency telling banks they need written permission from bank supervisors before engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities, including custody services.

Investing.com – Comcast stock (NASDAQ:CMCSA) was up 2% in premarket Thursday, the company enjoying a booming at its theme parks to beat estimates in the fourth quarter.
It also raised its dividend for the year, the 14th year in a row that it has done so. Revenue in the quarter through December rose 9.5% year-on-year to exceed $30 billion.
Theme Parks revenue almost tripled to $1.9 billion as guests in the U.S. thronged to its facilities after almost a two-year long pandemic. Visits were higher in Japan too. Guests in the two countries also spent more than last time, according to the company.
Driven by theme parks, revenue at NBCUniversal, the unit that houses the business, jumped nearly 26% to $9.4 billion. Universal Beijing opened in September and “essentially” achieved break-even, the company said.
Comcast’s revenue from the cable business, its biggest, rose 4.5% to top $16 billion. Overall cable customer accounts including broadband, video, voice and other services were higher by 3.3% and exceeded 34 million. However, last year’s pandemic-fueled expansion of its broadband subscriber base petered out, the company adding only 212,000 customers in the quarter, down nearly 61% from last year.
Monthly active accounts at its streaming service Peacock crossed 24 million in U.S by the end of December and the company launched the service in U.K. and Ireland.
Adjusted profit per share of 77 cents was over 37% higher than last time out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. business leaders expressed support for key parts of President Joe Biden's proposed $1.75 trillion spending bill on climate and social programs even as it faces an uncertain future in Congress.
The White House is still pushing to win approval for more than $500 billion to tackle climate change and boost electric vehicles along with hundreds of billions of dollars for universal preschool, paid family leave and other social safety spending.
""I offer a full-throated endorsement of the climate provisions,"" Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith said at a White House meeting, adding the United States needs to do more to bring more Americans back to work ""and people can only come back to work if they have a way to take care of their children.""
He praised the bill's focus on job training and efforts to boost child care. Smith also praised aspects of the bill that would boost sustainable aviation fuel.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra noted the Detroit automaker is making big investments in EV and it needs key provisions in the proposal ""that are going to uncap EV credits.""
Cummings CEO Tom Linebarger said the engine manufacturer is pursuing clean technology initiatives.
""We can't do it alone. The truth is we need tax credits in the Build Back Better act for hydrogen and clean trucks,"" he said at the event.
Biden would increase the current $7,500 EV tax credit to up to $12,500 for union-made U.S. vehicles and create credits of up to $4,000 for used vehicles. The bill would also again make GM and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eligible for tax credits after they hit the 200,000-vehicle cap on the existing $7,500 credit.
The $4,500 union EV credit has come under heavy criticism from foreign automakers.

The bill also includes a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles. Build Back Better would allocate $3.5 billion for converting U.S. factories for production of electrified or fuel cell vehicles and revive incentives that could generate $3.7 billion for automotive communities by 2031.
""It is vital that we have that (EV manufacturing) in the United States,"" Barra said Wednesday. She called $52 billion in separate proposed funding for semiconductor production ""a national imperative.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian lender UniCredit has signed an agreement with unions for 1,200 voluntary job cuts to be partly offset by 725 new hires, the country's biggest banking union said on Thursday.
The accord follows a new three-year plan https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/unicredit-targets-2024-net-profit-above-45-bln-euros-2021-12-09 to the end of 2024 presented on Dec. 9 by Chief Executive Andrea Orcel, who had taken over in April from predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier.
At the time UniCredit had not disclosed job cuts, saying it first had to negotiate with unions.
The FABI union welcomed the accord reached overnight, saying the proportion of six news hires for every 10 departures was a first. Italian banking unions have traditionally aimed to offset 50% of layoffs with the hiring of younger staff.
Layoffs in Italy's banking sector target older employees because they are carried out exclusively through costly early retirement schemes funded by lenders.
After the presentation of the ""UniCredit Unlocked"" 2022-2024 plan, Italian unions had said there would be 950 voluntary departures through early retirement, plus 475 new hires.
FABI said that a further 250 job cuts had been agreed, fully offset by 250 new arrivals.
UniCredit will also make 1,000 temporary job contracts permanent in Italy, FABI said.
During Mustier's tenure UniCredit had cut 14,000 jobs under a 2016-2019 plan. A second plan presented in December 2019 and due to run through 2023 envisaged a further 8,000 cuts, 6,000 of which were to be in Italy https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-banks-unicredit-jobs-idUSKBN21J5J9. The bank eventually agreed 5,200 departures in Italy and 2,600 new hires under that plan. 
With the bulk of previous redundancies hitting the bank's branch network, UniCredit targeted central functions, as well as international hubs, with its latest cuts.
FABI said that 83% of the new hires would beef up branch staffing while the remaining 17% will be in digital banking.

UniCredit is also planning to hire staff to boost its digital skills and client-facing activities in Germany, where a net 1,100 jobs will be axed by 2024, a source close to the matter said.
With the cuts targeting mainly the central offices of local arm HVB, the new hires will add staff dedicated to private banking and wealth management, the source said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An EU law on gathering airline passenger information conforms with the bloc's rights and data protection laws, but such data should only be retained if it is linked to a security threat and then only for five years, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
Adopted in 2016, the Passenger Name Record Directive (PNR) allows police and justice officials to access passenger data on flights to and from the EU to prevent serious crimes.
It has drawn criticism from rights groups including Belgium's LDH, which in 2017 asked a domestic court to annul it for infringing privacy and data protection norms. 
The court sought advice from the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), and that court's advocate general, Giovanni Pitruzzella, said on Thursday that the PNR complied with the bloc's data protection law.

He said there were sufficient safeguards to ensure the data's security and confidentiality, but added that authorities should only be allowed to retain that information if a link to the fight against terrorism or other serious crimes could be established, and then only for five years.
The CJEU, which follows four out of five such non-binding opinions, will give its ruling sometime in the coming months.

Investing.com – Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) stock was up 4.5% in premarket trading Thursday as Chinese regulators conditionally approved AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) $35 billion takeover of the computing platforms developer.
The deal was first announced in October 2020. Regulators in U.S., U.K. and Europe have already blessed the deal.
The acquisition will take AMD into high-growth areas of automotive and communications networking, while strengthening its portfolio in the lucrative market for Cloud data center components.
The State Administration for Market Regulation's approval is noteworthy given that regulatory approvals for tech deals in U.S., China and Europe have been tough to come by in recent times. Concerns surrounding security and unfettered access to critical technology have thwarted numerous takeover attempts by companies, most recently Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s attempt to buy ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY).
China’s State Administration for Market Regulation attached a few riders before giving its OK. It asked AMD not to discriminate against Chinese clients and to continue supplying Xilinx’s products to the country.
The nod comes a day after Xilinx topped $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, up 26% year-on-year. Third-quarter net profit jumped 67% to $325 million as selling expenses and amortization costs fell.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 07:07AM ET</span>",EU watchdog seeks more influence over margin calls at clearing houses,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's securities watchdog proposed changes on Thursday to the bloc's rules for clearing houses, saying more harmonisation was needed to avoid the sector amplifying market turmoil by hiking up cash calls unnecessarily.
Clearing refers to a key leg of a stock, bond or derivatives trade, ensuring the transaction is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust. 
Europe's leading clearers are operated by Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), Euronext ,  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) and the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE).
Markets were volatile in March and April 2020 when economies first went into lockdowns to fight the unfolding pandemic, triggering margin calls.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said that while clearers performed well overall during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis, the surge in margins, or cash required to back trades against defaulting, may have worsened market stress.
""The surge in initial margin observed has raised questions as to whether some increases... may have acted in a procyclical manner... and therefore should be mitigated through regulatory or supervisory measures,"" ESMA said in its consultation paper.
Pro-cyclicality refers to inadvertently exaggerating market stresses, such as by requiring everyone to find more cash to back trades at the same time.
ESMA proposed that clearers should be more transparent in how they review margin calls by first seeking advice from representatives of clearing members and clients.
It also proposed that clearing houses assess how changes in margins could amplify market turmoil, using metrics such as specific time periods.

Clearing houses did not respond to the same extent to market stresses in 2020, but suggesting a cap or ""speed limit"" on margin calls could be potentially harmful, the watchdog said.
""ESMA believes it is therefore premature to introduce such provisions at this stage but reserves itself the right to consider further changes once policy discussions have progressed at the international level,"" it said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's Tata Group took control of state-run carrier Air India on Thursday, regaining ownership of the airline after nearly 70 years and marking a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's privatisation push.
The auto-to-steel conglomerate in October won the bid https://reut.rs/3AyAZTz to take over Air India in a $2.4 billion equity and debt deal, ending years of struggle to privatise the financially troubled airline that was kept afloat using taxpayer funds.
The Air India strategic disinvestment transaction has been completed today with the government receiving about $360 million in equity and Tata taking over more than $2 billion of Air India's debt, the finance ministry said in a statement. 
""We are excited to have Air India back in the Tata Group and are committed to making this a world-class airline,"" Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said in a statement. 
The deal includes three entities - full-service carrier Air India, its low-cost arm Air India Express and AI SATS, which provides ground-handling and cargo services.
Tata Group already operates two other airlines - Vistara, in a joint venture with Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY), and AirAsia India, which it operates in partnership with AirAsia Group. But both have yet to make money. 
The purchase of debt-ridden Air India will give Tata immediate access to valuable flying rights and landing slots, but industry executives say it will be an uphill battle https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/challenges-abound-tata-draws-up-flight-plan-air-india-2021-10-19 to turnaround the carrier's financials and service levels.
The airline, with its maharajah mascot, was once renowned for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service championed by founder JRD Tata. Air India was founded in 1932 and nationalised in 1953. 

Since the mid-2000s, however, Air India's reputation has declined as financial troubles mounted. It flew widebody planes with business class seats in poor repair and grounded some of its new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners to use for spare parts. Customers faced many delays and staff and suppliers were not always paid on time.
Air India's biggest competitive advantage is its ability to fly non-stop to destinations such as the United States and Europe, where it enjoys lucrative landing rights and where foreign carriers such as Emirates can only compete with stopover options.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's easyJet (LON:EZJ) said the easing of travel restrictions had spurred demand for summer beach destinations such as Greece, Turkey and Spain, giving the airline cause for optimism after the shadow of Omicron lifts.
Its chief executive Johan Lundgren said bookings jumped in Britain when restrictions were reduced earlier this month and were boosted again when the government said testing requirements would end in February.
He said easyJet had seen similar trends across Europe, notably in France and Switzerland.
""We see a strong summer ahead, with pent-up demand that will see easyJet returning to near 2019 levels of capacity with UK beach and leisure routes performing particularly well,"" he said.
The airline flew 64% of pre-pandemic capacity in its first quarter to end-December, but its 77% load factor missed its forecast of over 80% after the new variant of COVID-19 dented demand in December.
Omicron would continue to have a short-term impact, it said, although it will ramp up capacity from around 50% of pre-pandemic levels in January to 67% for the second quarter. 
In November, before the impact of Omicron was clear, easyJet had forecast capacity of around 70% for the quarter.
Shares in easyJet, which have risen 6% in the last 12 months, were up 1% in early trading on Thursday.
Lundgren, who bolstered easyJet's balance sheet with a 1.2 billion pound rights issue in September, said unlike other airlines that were retrenching, easyJet was adding capacity.
He said 1.1 million extra seats were on sale from its largest airport, London Gatwick, while it had launched 16 new routes from the UK and had added capacity to 30 destinations.

Total group revenue for easyJet's first quarter to end-December increased to 805 million pounds ($1.1 billion) against 165 million pounds a year ago, while its headline loss before tax for the quarter nearly halved to 213 million pounds.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS has agreed to buy California-based digital wealth management start-up Wealthfront in a $1.4 billion all-cash deal, as the Swiss bank targets younger tech-savvy investors in the United States.
UBS said it would make Wealthfront's capabilities ""the foundation"" as it seeks to grow business amongst the 130 million millennial and Gen Z investors in the United States who will ""own an increasing share of the world's wealth"".
The acquisition marks the first major deal in Chief Executive Ralph Hamers' bid to reach customers outside UBS's super-rich core client base - made up primarily of billionaires and multi-millionaires - by upping digital services.
One of the largest digital wealth management firms known as ""robo-advisers"", Wealthfront caters primarily to millennial and Gen Z investors, and currently counts around half a million clients in the United States, the two firms said.
It manages more than $27 billion in assets, having added cryptocurrencies and socially responsible investing into the mix in 2021.
""Adding Wealthfront's capabilities and client base to our global investment ecosystem will significantly boost our ability to grow our business in the U.S.,"" Hamers said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
UBS in October outlined a push to lure in more affluent clients in America by building up a digitally scalable advice model, as the bank sought to increase its share in its biggest wealth market.
The world's number one wealth manager is set to unveil the results of Hamers' broader strategic review when it reports results on Feb. 1. Hamers became CEO in November 2020 following a successful stint digitalising Dutch lender ING.
The Wealthfront purchase, set to close in the second half of 2022, follows UBS' roll-out of a 'hybrid' platform blending digital and personal advisory services in Europe and Asia, launched in 2020 to quick uptake.
Wealthfront will become a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS and will operate as a business within UBS Global Wealth Management Americas, the companies added.
""If successful, we believe UBS could roll out the model on a global scale,"" Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said.
Joining up with UBS will let Wealthfront offer clients more services and research, its CEO David Fortunato said. ""We couldn't be more excited to have found a strategic partner who has the same view on the power of technology,"" he added. 
The purchase follows a trend set by U.S. rivals Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in looking to broaden their client bases beyond the super-high-net-worth individuals they traditionally served.

UBS said it would finance the deal with excess capital.
The companies said UBS Investment Bank is acting as financial adviser to UBS, and Sullivan & Cromwell as legal counsel. Qatalyst Partners is Wealthfront's financial adviser, and Fenwick & West is acting as legal counsel.

“The market is not being very patient with them,” said Greg Martin, co-founder and managing director at Rainmaker Securities, a brokerage specializing in private company deals.
Waning investor interest in retail trading has weighed on shares of the commission-free online brokerage, which saw explosive growth at the beginning of 2021 as retail investors gobbled up viral stocks https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-anger/robinhood-is-new-eye-of-gamestop-storm-as-outrage-grows-idUSKBN29X33D including GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Robinhood's monthly active users jumped from 11.7 million at the end of 2020 to 21.3 million at the end of June 2021. 
California-based Robinhood achieved a valuation of $31.8 billion on its initial public offering https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-gateway-meme-stocks-raises-21-billion-ipo-source-2021-07-28 in July. But it has slumped since then, and closed Wednesday down 85% from its 52-week high. 
In addition to smaller trading volumes, analysts cited regulatory scrutiny of Robinhood’s main source of revenue: order flow it sells to market makers.
“They've got a global brand, which they basically did with zero marketing. Now, they need to create more long-lasting revenue streams that are more sustainable,"" said Martin.
One analyst said Robinhood needs to find a way to get its share price up or it could become a takeover target.
Robinhood declined to comment, but has said it continues to gain customers as it adds new products and features, and expects that trend to continue. The company, which offers stock, options and cryptocurrency trading, is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon. 
Like many tech start-ups, Robinhood has yet to turn a profit as a public company. Its two quarters https://www.reuters.com/technology/robinhood-revenue-more-than-doubles-crypto-trading-boom-2021-08-18 of results have so far disappointed investors. 
Robinhood's modest gains in revenue have been driven largely by a surge in crypto trading in the second quarter. Stock trading activity has eased from peaks during last year's trading frenzy, partly offset by a rise in options volumes. 
Robinhood's average revenue per user swooned to $65 in the third quarter from $137 in the first quarter of 2021. 
Analysts agree the company must expand its offerings to survive in a crowded space, especially if U.S. stock prices fall further from record highs as expected with the Federal Reserve preparing to raise interest rates https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26.
Chaim Siegel, founder and head of U.S. equity research at Elazar Advisors, called rising interest rates a key threat.
“So many high-flying, no earnings or low-earnings companies have just been hit very hard in the last two months,” said Siegel, who downgraded Robinhood to neutral in August. 
Last week, investors sold stocks as they grappled with changing Fed policies and tension between Russia and Ukraine. Wall Street posted its biggest weekly decline https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/global-markets-wrapup-1-2022-01-26 since early in the pandemic in March of 2020. 
Rising interest rates will probably push investors into safer assets, and many could cut positions in stocks or crypto. That could mean less trading for retail investors, the core of Robinhood’s customer base. 
""A ton of them are going to lose money, then lose interest,” said Jeff Tomasulo, chief executive officer of Vespula Capital Management.
Retail trading volume peaked in January 2021, making up nearly 27% of U.S. stock trading volume, according to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) data. By November, retail trading volume had declined to 21.42% of total market volume.
SEC CRACKDOWN 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering whether to reform or even ban payment for order flow (PFOF), whereby brokers route trades to wholesale market makers in return for a fee.
Robinhood derived nearly 75% of its revenue from PFOF and other transaction rebates in the third quarter of 2021. 
It has said it does not expect the SEC to ban the practice, but expressed confidence it could find other ways to generate revenue, possibly executing client orders internally.
Still, the threat of an SEC crackdown is an ""overhang"" for the stock, said Martin of Rainmaker Securities. 
Looking to expand its revenue stream beyond transactions, Robinhood now offers customers the opportunity to buy into IPOs. It has been testing a wealth management tool and has talked about offering retirement accounts.
Robinhood shareholders are probably looking for the company to limit its spending, said Siegel, which would make it harder to offer new products. The company also must deal with fines stemming from the meme stock frenzy last year.
Robinhood's legal expenses jumped from https://www.reuters.com/technology/regulatory-legal-headwinds-facing-robinhood-2021-07-02 $1.4 million in 2019 to $105 million in 2020, according to its IPO filing. Other financial firms https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/big-us-banks-see-higher-expenses-workers-rising-wages-2022-01-19 have also been pinched by upward pressure on labor costs.

Tomasulo said it remains to be seen if the market will be patient. 
“There's not many brokers out there like Robinhood, so I can see as Robinhood gets cheaper and cheaper, this becomes a really good takeover target.""

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 06:12AM ET</span>",Factbox-How the SEC is cracking down on the equity market after GameStop saga,"By John McCrank and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year after the ""meme stock"" rally humbled hedge funds and roiled Wall Street, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on several areas of the equity market. 
""The events of last January gave us an opportunity to consider how we can further our efforts to make the equity markets as fair, orderly, and efficient as possible,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday. 
He was referring to so-called ""Reddit rally"" in which  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other ""meme stocks"" popular on Reddit and other social media surged to extreme highs on buying from investors trading heavily through Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) and other commission-free retail brokerages. The surge led to big losses, or a ""short squeeze"" for hedge funds who had bet the shares would decline. 
The intense volatility prompted Robinhood and others to restrict trading in the affected stocks, curbing the rally, infuriating retail investors and rattling market confidence.
Here are issues the SEC is scrutinizing:
DIGITAL TRADING PROMPTS
Gensler has criticized the ""gamification of trading"" in which commission-free brokerages and other digital platforms encourage excessive trading using lights, noises, notifications other psychological gimmicks common on video games.
He has also highlighted the use of artificial intelligence, predictive data analytics and machine learning to push products. 
In August https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-markets-regulator-wants-public-feedback-firms-digital-engagement-practices-2021-08-27, the SEC issued a consultation on potential new rules to limit gamification and these other ""digital engagement prompts."" The agency is expected to proceed with a rule change https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/will-games-stop-sec-mulls-crackdown-trading-apps-2022-01-26 in coming months.
PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW
Gensler has criticized payment for order flow (PFOF), the practice in which commission-free brokers generate revenue by sending customer orders to wholesale market makers in return for payments, rather than to exchanges.
He has floated https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-gensler-markets-idCNL4N2Q13ST a ban on the practice, saying it raises potential conflicts of interest, giving brokers incentives to encourage customers to trade more frequently to maximize the payments. 
Proponents say PFOF is a major reason brokerages were able to stop charging commissions, and retail investors often get a lower better price than they would on the main exchange.
CONCENTRATION, PRICING
The GameStop saga highlighted the small number of market-makers that dominate the retail market, which could pose competition issues, Gensler has said. 
Overall, more than 40% of all trades are executed away from exchanges. That is partly due to rules that allow market makers to offer fractional sub-penny price improvement on bids and offers, whereas exchanges have to quote in pennies, which Gensler has said has created an unlevel playing field.
According to its latest public agenda https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST&currentPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=3235&csrf_token=ACE6459BAE38251002FF06695AAC34E8A26DDF9AEFCB5DF139E0DAC4CD05ADBEA9212C833BBEE3FE8C7DC33AC6BDF83B2299, the SEC is considering proposing changes ""to modernize rules related to equity market structure such as those relating to order routing, conflicts of interest, best execution, market concentration, and the disclosure of best execution statistics.""
SHORT SELLING, HEDGE FUND DISCLOSURES
The GameStop saga intensified worries over hedge fund transparency. On Wednesday the SEC proposed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-hedge-funds/update-2-u-s-hedge-funds-private-equity-firms-to-disclose-more-data-under-sec-proposal-idUSL1N2U61FB new rules to boost hedge fund disclosures on material events, including extraordinary losses.
Most of the stocks in the GameStop saga were heavily shorted - a strategy used to bet a stock price will fall. While the SEC said in its post-mortem https://www.reuters.com/business/fun-facts-us-sec-report-januarys-gamestop-saga-2021-10-18 of the saga that the available data did not suggest foul play when it came to such short sales, Gensler has said greater transparency of short selling may be warranted.
The agency plans to finally implement a rule created by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act that would expand the current investment position reporting requirements to include details on short sales.
SETTLEMENT TIMES
The ""meme stock"" volatility prompted the post-trade clearinghouse that guarantees trades to demand that retail brokerages pay billions of dollars in extra collateral to guarantee trades in case either party defaults.
In response, several brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the problem was largely due the two days it takes trades to settle, and if settlements were in real time so much collateral would not be necessary. 
The SEC is also mulling changes to shorten the settlement cycle to one day.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 05:55AM ET</span>",STMicro to double investments to meet high chip demand,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) -French-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics plans to double its investments this year to up to $3.6 billion, buoyed by high demand that drove its earnings to beat expectations in the fourth quarter, sending its shares up. 
The step up in spending stems from a global chip shortage that has hit manufacturers and fuelled inflation for semi-conductors, which range from low-added value chips in washing machines to sophisticated sensors in cars and smartphones. 
The Geneva-based company said on Thursday it planned between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion in capital spending this year, compared with $1.8 billion in 2021, including building the first production line of a new 300 mm wafer plant in Agrate, Italy. 
STMicro, whose biggest clients include electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), expects net revenue this year in a range of $14.8 billion to $15.3 billion, a 20% increase at the top of the range.
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery said he expected the chip shortage in the automotive industry to continue and that he saw no signs of any inventory buildup. 
Instead, ""the challenge ... is to have the capability to support the major transformation of the automotive and mobility industry"", Chery said on a call with analysts and journalists.
STMicro shares opened up 2% before extending gains after Chery's comments. They were trading at 5.9% at 1012 GMT, the best-performing stock on the CAC 40 benchmark index. 
STMicro's larger peers have also fared well. Industry bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) beat market expectations this week and is also boosting capacity.
Taiwanese chip firm TSMC this month said it expected strong growth to accelerate in coming years due to booming semiconductor demand.
The semiconductor bottleneck was still being felt at the start of 2022. 
Japanese automaker Toyota said last week it expected to miss its annual nine million vehicle production target because competition for chips meant it didn't have enough to ramp up car output to offset production lost during the pandemic last year.

STMicro made fourth-quarter earnings per share of $0.82, beating ​analysts' average estimate of 69 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
However, the group sees first-quarter sales around $3.5 billion, down 1.6% from the previous quarter, and gross margin around 45%.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 2.5% in Thursday’s premarket as its profit forecast for the current quarter amid ""unprecedented demand"" for chips disappointed.
The company’s first-quarter forecast of 80 cents in EPS and 52% gross margin left market players worried given its heavy capital spending and extreme supply constraints. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger expects supply issues to persist this year and into next, according to Reuters.
Gross margin is seen 6.8 percentage points lower while EPS is expected to weaken 40% year-on-year. Intel is also expecting its first-quarter revenue to fall 1% to $18.3 billion.
In last 10 months, the company has committed at least $40 billion to setting up four semiconductor units, two each in Arizona and Ohio. 
""With the high capex spend planned, we think Intel's gross margin could come under more pressure,"" said Kinngai Chan, a senior chip analyst at Summit Insights Group.
The recent quarter was Intel’s best in revenue terms as it grew 4% year-on-year to go past $19 billion, aided by robust demand for its server chips. The company said it shipped a record number of those in the period.
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter ended December 25 was 55.4%, a sequential decline of 4.6 percentage points. Profit per share of $1.09 beat estimates.

1599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 05:09AM ET</span>",Bridgewater Sees ‘Much Bigger’ Drop in Stocks Before Fed Blinks,"(Bloomberg) -- How much further is the Federal Reserve willing to let stocks slide? That’s the burning question of the moment for financial markets, and Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater Associates, has an answer: as much as 20% more.
That’d put the S&P 500 below 3,500, or close to where it was before the Covid-19 pandemic began two years ago. The benchmark U.S. index closed Wednesday at 4,350.
The reality, Jensen explained, is policy makers have little reason to halt the selloff that has savaged the most speculative stocks and spurred equity volatility to a 12-month high. On the contrary, inflation in the U.S. is running at the hottest in four decades, labor is scarce and companies are building inventories because of supply-chain threats.
“Some decline in asset prices is not a bad thing from the Fed’s perspective, so they’re going to let it happen,” Jensen, 47, said in an interview over Zoom. “At these levels, it would take a much bigger move to get the ‘Fed put’ into the money. They’re a long way from that.”
He figures it’d take a drop of 15% to 20% to alarm the central bank, and even that would depend on how fast the bottom falls out from under the market. So far, Jensen said, the decline over the past few weeks has been “mostly healthy” because it has “deflated some of the bubbles,” such as cryptocurrencies.
House View
Jensen, who serves as co-CIO with Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio and Bob Prince, represents the house view at the world’s biggest hedge fund, with about $150 billion in assets. And in Bridgewater’s analysis, much of what has been happening lately is simply math: Asset prices were elevated by injections of “excess liquidity.” Now that policy makers are withdrawing that monetary stimulus, “there aren’t enough buyers to make up the difference,” Jensen said.
The result is what he calls a “liquidity hole” affecting both stocks and bonds.
Anyone who expects the Fed to blink, as it did after the last pre-pandemic selloff in late 2018, is misreading the economy, Jensen said. Things were different then. Inflation was below the Fed’s 2% target and big companies were buying back shares instead of adding capacity, stockpiling supplies and raising wages.
Fed Chairman Jay Powell inherited an orthodoxy that dates back to Alan Greenspan. In Jensen’s words:
“Since the 1980s, problems have always been solved by easing. That was true fiscally and monetarily, and the countries that eased more did better than the countries that eased less,” he said. “We’re at a turning point now and things will be much different.”
For the first time since Paul Volcker’s Fed of the early 1980s, inflation has accelerated so fast it’s become a political issue. Powell, speaking to reporters after the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, acknowledged the central bank may have to jack up borrowing costs faster than the market anticipated to stop prices from spiraling higher.
Jensen doesn’t think the Fed wants the market to crash, just reset to a level where it’s more reflective of cash flows in the “real economy” and no longer a channel for inflationary pressures to build. He expects policy makers will be watching closely to see if lower asset prices have any effect on job creation.
One question Jensen raised is who’ll buy all the bonds that the Fed has been soaking up with quantitative easing. In addition to raising rates in March, policy makers are set to end the asset-purchase program that has inflated the central bank balance sheet by trillions of dollars.
Jensen said he figures the 10-year Treasury yield has to reach 3.5% or even 4% -- up from less than 1.9% today -- before private investors are ready to absorb all the government debt that the Fed has been monetizing.
In that scenario, with Treasury prices set to decline further, bonds fail as a hedge against stocks and the traditional 60/40 balanced portfolio is useless as a diversification tool. Jensen said a 1970s-style “stagflation” playbook is more appropriate, and investors need to increase their commodity holdings, trade out of U.S. stocks in favor of international equities and use breakevens to combat inflation.
“Expecting the environment to feel like it did over the past couple of decades is a big mistake,” he said.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 0.5% lower in premarket Thursday as the EV-maker’s warning of supply chain constraints outweighed its bullish projections on deliveries.
The company said it won't launch any new models this year, concentrating instead on increasing production of its existing models.
“We will not be introducing new vehicle models this year, it would not make any sense, because we’ll still be parts constrained,” CEO Elon Musk told an analyst call.
Tesla has usually been on top of the supply chain issues that have crippled most automakers for more than a year. But Musk's comments suggested those issues have finally caught up with the world’s most valuable automaker.
The market has been waiting for some announcement on new launches as competition from the likes of Ford (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG), Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV)hots up in U.S., Europe and China, the three biggest markets.
Musk said the company would launch its Cybertruck, Semi and Roadster next year.
The company said it is ramping up output at new factories in Austin and Berlin as well as the established units in Fremont and Shanghai. Full self-driving vehicles remains a priority for the company, Musk said, despite the company's repeated failure to meet Musk's publicly stated predictions.
The company aims to deliver 50% more vehicles in 2022 which means more than 1.4 million units this year, up from 936,222 units in 2021.
Tesla's revenue for the quarter grew 65% to near $18 billion. Adjusted profit per share was $2.54, and like sales, beat estimates.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, earned a return on investment of 1.58 trillion Norwegian crowns ($177 billion) last year, the second highest on record, with the biggest boost coming from tech stocks, it said on Thursday.
The $1.3 trillion fund's return on investment stood at 14.5% for the year, which was 0.74 percentage point higher than the return on the fund's benchmark index.
""The good results are mainly due to very strong developments in the equity market throughout the year,"" Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen said in a statement.
""There was good return in all sectors, but the investments in technology and financials performed particularly well,"" he said.
Tech stocks made a return of 30.2%, making it the best-performing sector.
Founded in 1996, the fund invests revenue from Norway's oil and gas sector and holds stakes in some 9,100 companies globally, owning 1.4% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds, unlisted real estate and renewable energy infrastructure.
Last year's return was the second highest in the fund's history, exceeded only by the 1.69 trillion crowns earned in 2019.
The biggest individual contributors to the fund's returns were  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), presentation material showed.
On a country basis, investments in the United States contributed the most, with 960 billion crowns in returns, followed by Britain with 112 billion crowns.

The fund holds the equivalent of $244,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Banco Sabadell expects to hit its 6% profitability target a year early, it said on Thursday after posting better than forecast quarterly and annual profit on the back of cost savings and a rise in mortgage lending.
Lower impairments for last year as it recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic helped the bank to a 530 million euro ($598 million) net profit for 2021, above the 2 million euros in 2020 and the 403 million euros expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
This allowed Sabadell to close the year with a 5% return on tangible equity (ROTE), up from 0.02% in 2020. It now expects ROTE of more than 6% in 2022, a year earlier than envisaged in its three-year strategy.
The bank said that further cost savings and lower provisions in 2022 should continue to support earnings in the coming quarters.
In its fourth quarter to Dec. 31, Spain's fourth-largest bank by assets swung to a net profit of 161 million euros from a 201 million euro loss in the same period of 2020 and far above analyst expectations of 34 million euros.
Sabadell shares rose more than 2% on the results, against a 0.8% decline for Spain's blue-chip index.
Quarterly results were also helped by new mortgages in the UK, jumping 56% year on year to almost 2.17 billion pounds ($2.91 billion) and helping Sabadell's UK subsidiary TSB to book a 33 million pound net profit.
Sabadell had been planning to sell TSB but has frozen the process for now. TSB's contribution to Sabadell's group results rose to 118 million euros last year, against a 220 million euro loss in 2020.
At group level, fourth-quarter net interest income rose 1% from a year earlier to 863 million euros, in line with analyst expectations, but fell 1.6% against the previous quarter on weaker bond sales and pressure from low interest rates.

The lender also said its board had approved a 0.03 euro per share cash dividend against 2021 results, equivalent to a 31.8% dividend payout.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 03:41AM ET</span>",Stock selloff is far from forcing the Fed to blink,"By David Randall and Tommy Wilkes
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Those clinging to a decade-old belief that the Fed will mount a rescue of tanking stock markets with a last-minute pushback on the timing of interest rate hikes may be left disappointed.
Equities have nosedived and government bond yields have risen in the runup to Wednesday afternoon's Federal Reserve policy decision https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26, which is widely expected to signal an interest rate liftoff in March and the timing of stimulus cutbacks.
While the rout has since eased, it raised the question: how much pain must stock markets endure before the Fed backstop - or ""put"" - comes into play? And has that estimate changed? 
Named for the hedging derivative used to protect against market falls, the ""put"" was deployed during previous selloffs, most recently in early 2019 when a market tantrum persuaded the Fed to call time on its rate hiking cycle.
Now after years of easy-money polices, stakes are high. A trillion dollars flooded into global stocks last year, surpassing the combined total of the past 19 years, and U.S. stocks have doubled in value since March 2020.
Based on history, Julian Emanuel at Evercore ISI Research reckons the S&P 500 would need to fall by 23.8% from its recent high for the central bank to act. Janus Henderson Investors estimates the put kicks in when declines surpass 15%.
But this time, the need to stamp out inflation running at 40-year highs around 7% may change the equation. 
""The Fed will typically only let the risk markets to sell off so much before they feel the need to slow it down a little bit. But now we have to ask, will they allow it go down 20%? Twenty-five percent?"" said Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.
""It's new territory.""
While a rebound is now under way, year-to-date losses https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/analysis-fed-tightening-a-sign-to-get-the-heck-out-of-us-stocks/ar-AATaxxg amount to 9% and 12% for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, respectively. 
Holding off tightening also raises risks the Fed might have to hike more should inflation get out of control. And it would go against policymakers' view that the economy has recovered faster than anticipated.
""The Fed ... because of the current inflation backdrop is not going to be able to blink. That's an issue markets are going to have to deal with,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Graham (NYSE:GHM) Secker said.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
Equity selloffs matter to policymakers because they can tighten financial conditions, in turn impacting the spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households. 
Though the Fed’s dual mandates of maximum employment and stable prices do not take into account market swings, research https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26894/w26894.pdf showed the central bank is sensitive to equity weakness, with policymakers’ negative stock market mentions associated with cuts in the fed funds rate.
Indexes compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and the Fed imply conditions are indeed tightening, but from historically loose levels.
Metrics that feed in to these indexes do not show much stress. While sovereign bond yields have risen - U.S. two and 10-year yields are at pre-pandemic levels - moves are less stark once inflation is stripped out. 
Both U.S. and German 10-year ""real"" yields remain below where they were for much of 2021 and 2020.
And yield premia on junk-rated credit, normally vulnerable to stock market falls, remain well below year-ago levels. U.S. corporate credit spreads remain low versus pre-pandemic levels.
""If you want to be bearish you could say the selloff has not done very much to tighten financial conditions,"" Morgan Stanley's Secker said.
There is, however, another view. Whereas once policymakers ignored share prices and focused on corporate borrowing costs, some investors today believe that ""markets drive economies,"" making it much harder for policymakers to stomach significant stock selloffs. 
Michael Howell at consultancy CrossBorder Capital said conditions were tightening faster than many measures capture. 
Oil prices have risen, central banks have slowed the rate of money growth injected into economies and on a quarterly basis money supply is shrinking, Howell noted.
""A 10% drop in the markets would be OK, much more than that they may find it very difficult,"" he said. 

Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said stock market ""fragility"" ruled out a 50 bps hike in March, which some investors have predicted. 
But, he said, the Fed will proceed with hikes ""until something breaks,"" adding, ""it's far too soon in the process for the Fed to be dissuaded by equity investor anxiety.""

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 03:30AM ET</span>",China property shares slump as planned U.S. rate hike adds to woes,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group shares slumped on Thursday after the developer's thinly detailed roadmap for restructuring left investors dissatisfied and its indebted peers also fell on concerns higher interest rates would raise financing costs.
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into crisis, highlighted by Evergrande, the world's most indebted property firm. The contagion has engulfed other Chinese developers, roiled global financial markets in the past year and contributed to a slump in China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of its economy. 
Evergrande closed 3.4% lower at HK$1.71 ($0.2195) on Thursday, narrowing from a 9.6% loss in early trading, on investor scepticism in the developer's plan to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place in six months.
The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index shed 2.6%, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 2%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it is likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases.
""Chinese real estate companies are highly leveraged, with a lot of overseas debt, so U.S. Fed signalling large room for rate hikes will put even more pressure on their financing,"" said Alvin Cheung, associate director of Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Brokerage Ltd. 
The long-awaited communication between Evergrande and creditors occurred as Beijing plans to tighten control over the property developer, while taking measures to stabilise China's property sector.
Evergrande's assets are expected to be taken over by state-owned firms in a restructuring led by the Guangdong provincial government, where Evergrande is based, Reuters has reported.
Those plans appears to be in place with Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the matter, reporting on Thursday that the provincial government submitted a proposal to Beijing to sell most of Evergrande's assets except for its separately listed property management and electric vehicle units. 
A group led by China Cinda Asset Management Co, a state-owned bad debt manager and major Evergrande creditor, would take over any unsold property assets, the Bloomberg report said.
The Guangdong provincial government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Evergrande set up a risk management committee last month, mostly comprising senior officials from state entities including Cinda, and earlier this week it named Liang Senlin, chairman of China Cinda (HK) Holdings Company, a unit of Cinda, as a new board member.
CREDITORS CALL
Evergrande's stock slump on Thursday came after the company told investors in a call late on Wednesday that it hoped to work with them to achieve a risk management solution, and it would treat all categories of creditors ""fairly and follow international practice"". The company also urged creditors not to take any ""aggressive legal actions."" 
But some bondholders were disappointed by the 25-minute call, which included prepared answers to questions, saying it failed to give any insight on Evergrande's plans.
Adding to the pressure on Evergrande, the Financial Times said on Thursday that asset manager Oaktree Capital, who is a lender to Evergrande to develop a vast land plot in Hong Kong, moved this week to seize control of the asset by appointing a receiver after Evergrande defaulted on the loan.
The move could cause Evergrande's offshore debt restructuring plan to fail as the 2.2-million-square-foot (204,000-square-meter) luxury housing development was a crucial piece of collateral, the report said.
Evergrande has liabilities of $300 billion including nearly $20 billion of international bonds all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments late last year.
Amid Evergrande's plunge, other Chinese property companies suffered losses as well.
Shares of Times China Holdings plunged 26.8% to HK$3, after the Guangzhou-based developer said it would raise HK$400.2 million ($51.38 million) by placing shares at HK$3.4 apiece, a 17.1% discount to Wednesday closing price. 
The company sold 117.7 million shares, representing 5.6% of its enlarged capital, for debt repayment and working capital, it said in a filing. 
Shenzhen-based Logan Group also said on Thursday it raised HK$1.95 billion through 6.95% equity-linked securities due August 2026 to refinance debt.

Its shares fell 15.7%.

LONDON (Reuters) -Drinks group  Diageo  (LON:DGE) on Thursday reported first-half sales up nearly 16%, buoyed by high-end spirits for home use while bars increased orders as they reopened after coronavirus lockdowns.
The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky, Tanqueray gin and Guinness stout also said it will speed up its share buyback programme, aiming to complete the 4.5 billion pound ($6 billion)plan in its 2023 financial year rather than by the end of June 2024.
Operating profit rose by 22.5% to 2.7 billion pounds in the six months to Dec. 31, with its operating margin up by 190 basis points, Diageo said.
Net sales increased by 15.8% to 8 billion pounds.
The world's largest spirits maker has benefited from shoppers stocking up on alcohol at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, often trading up to more expensive types of alcohol.
Sales of premium products made up more than half of net sales.
Then as lockdowns eased, particularly in Europe and North America, bars have had to restock, buying more than the previous year. Net sales grew 13% in North America and were up 27% in Europe.
Rival Remy Cointreau this week said it is confident demand for its premium cognac in China, the United States and Europe will underpin profit growth this year after the French spirits group beat quarterly sales forecasts.
The European beverages sector outperformed the wider market almost uniformly in the fourth quarter, Bernstein analysts said. The distillers led the way while global brewers were more subdued because of rising raw material costs.
Shares in Diageo have repeatedly touched record highs since the company said in November that it expects organic net sales growth to be between 5% and 7% for its 2023-2025 financial years, against 4% to 6% growth over 2017-2019.
On Thursday the shares were up 1.3% at 36.92 pounds.

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last week raised Diageo's target price to 46.50 pounds from 45.30 pounds.

SEOUL (Reuters) -LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) on Thursday saw its stock price soar 68% on its trading debut following a record IPO, catapulting the electric vehicle (EV) battery maker to the rank of South Korea's second-most valuable company.
The convincing debut sets the stage for what analysts expect to be another bumper year for Korean initial public offerings (IPO), with a lack of mega-deals elsewhere in Asia seeing more institutional investors turn their attention toward the country.
But it was the worldwide trend toward the electrification of transport that spurred almost 2,000 prospective foreign and domestic institutional investors to lodge bids worth an eye-watering $12.8 trillion in LGES' IPO, hoping to bag shares in a company boasting a fifth of the EV battery market and with a client roster featuring heavyweights such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
LGES stock began trade at 597,000 won, almost double the 300,000 won price set in South Korea's biggest-ever IPO.
It closed at 505,000 won, 68% above the IPO price but 15% lower than Thursday's open in a market which fell 3.5%. Still, that left LGES, split off from LG Chem Ltd, second only to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd in terms of market value at 118 trillion won ($98.08 billion).
The debut performance was the benchmark KOSPI's best since financial services firm Kakao Pay Corp gained 114% in November versus its IPO price, and adds to Seoul's string of blockbuster listings in the past year.
LGES' market value is still dwarfed by the $208 billion of Chinese rival Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL). Moreover, analysts have flagged growing competition from Chinese peers expanding globally as well as the prospect of automakers developing their own battery technology.
However, Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo has said a 260 trillion won order backlog highlights LGES' growth potential.
""The stock is trading at an expected level considering its discount to CATL. Bigger upside will be seen in the second half of this year and next year as its U.S. factories get closer to being fully operational,"" said analyst Kang Dong-jin at Hyundai Motor Securities.
'ANT' INVESTORS
Over 20 companies went public on South Korea's main stock board last year, raising about 17 trillion won, nearly double the previous record of 8.8 trillion won in 2010, showed data from bourse operator Korea Exchange.
Analysts expect even more companies to list in South Korea this year, including startups such as mobility platform company SOCAR and online grocery services firm Kurly Inc.
Encouraging listing hopefuls is the flood of liquidity brought by retail investors, so-called ants, taking advantage of the government's pandemic-busting economic stimulus policy.

Over 4.4 million retail investors bid a record $95 billion to subscribe https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/skoreas-lg-energys-108-bln-ipo-draws-record-demand-retail-investors-2022-01-19 to LGES shares, in what was Asia's largest equity fund raising since China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd raised $12.9 billion in its 2019 Hong Kong secondary listing.

The world's largest economy is predicted to record GDP growth at a 37-year high of 5.5%, with data due later on Thursday. Some such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reckon the figure could be as high as 7.5%. We will also likely see weekly jobless benefits claims dropping further. 
That, in a nutshell, is why the U.S. Federal Reserve feels there is ""quite a bit of room to raise interest rates"".
Could there be more than four rate rises this year? Powell did not deny that possibility, so markets have started to price a fifth move.
Accordingly, Treasury two-year borrowing costs hit 23-month highs, shrinking the gap with 10-year yields. And on t-bills, the shortest-dated debt segment, Tradeweb notes a sharp steepening, with the gap between the three- and six-month yields at the steepest since 2015, and more than double from a month-ago period. 
Similar steepening is notable between other bill maturities in a sign more tightening is being priced. 
So the stock market selloff that had abated pre-Fed is back in full swing, with world stocks down 0.6%; European and Wall Street looking set for another tumble.
But if buyers are running scared, there are bargain hunters of a different sort -- billionaire William Ackman said he had snapped up $1 billion worth of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares since last Thursday's market tumble.
Companies, meanwhile, continue to deliver good news; Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for instance predicted 50%-plus growth this year, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) posted its biggest profit since 2011. But with buyers still in hiding, Tesla shares tanked in after-hours trade.
Graphic: Fed policy trails inflation by historic margin, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/gdpzynrmnvw/chart.png Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian industrial technology buyout fund Novo Tellus Capital Partners listed its special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in Singapore on Thursday, marking the third such IPO this month as the city-state seeks to become a hub for SPAC listings.
The trio of SPAC listings in Singapore comes almost a year after a frenzy of debuts of blank-cheque firms in the United States, which was stalled when regulatory changes and poor returns affected investor sentiment.
Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition, which raised S$150 million ($111 million), traded at S$4.96 versus its initial public offering (IPO) price of S$5 per unit. Each unit comprises one Class A share and one half of a warrant exercisable at S$5.75 per share.
SPACs, or shell firms, raise money on stock markets to buy private companies, effectively bringing those businesses to markets in shorter time frames and often stronger valuations.
At a listing ceremony on Thursday, Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition Chief Executive Loke Wai San said structural change in supply chain trends would benefit industrial and technology companies in the region. He also said Singapore was a key venue to list SPACs.
""We would be looking at companies in the S$500 million to S$1 billion range,"" Loke, also the CEO of Novo Tellus, told Reuters last week.
He said investors had ""expectations of stable growth, profitability and not hyper growth and huge losses"" for the SPAC's target group of industrial companies.
Earlier this month, Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Technology Acquisition Corp Ltd, sponsored by a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, raised S$200 million in the city.
Next to list was a S$170 million SPAC backed by European asset manager Tikehau Capital and a holding firm of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault.
Hong Kong is also allowing SPAC listings from this year but bars participation from retail investors.
Novo Tellus' SPAC IPO was heavily oversubscribed. Sponsored by Novo Tellus PE Fund 2, the IPO secured 13 cornerstone investors, including Malaysia's Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd and an indirect, fully owned subsidiary of Temasek.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and DBS were the joint issuer managers and joint global co-ordinator of the IPO.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>",Now or never? European banks eye comeback against Wall Street,"By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Replenished firepower and higher interest rates will give Europe's banks an ideal opportunity this year to reverse recent underperformance and claw back market share from rivals in the United States, industry experts say.
European lenders lost ground to Wall Street rivals during the pandemic because volatile markets boosted the earning power of U.S. banks' outsized trading arms. European rivals earn proportionately more from lending and benefit from a higher interest rate environment.
As the continent's biggest lenders prepare to report full-year earnings for 2021, kicking off with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/deutsche-bank-nearly-triples-q4-profit-defying-expected-loss-2022-01-27 on Thursday, European banks must seize the opportunity that now presents itself, analysts consultants and investors say.
""The need is becoming much more urgent for European banks to show what they truly stand for and how they're going to differentiate themselves to create an advantage for the long term,"" said Eriola Shehu Beetz, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group.
In investment banking, U.S. banks have beaten European rivals on their own turf by almost any metric in recent years, and the gap has been widening.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) between them claimed 31% of merger fees in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region in 2021, according to Refinitiv data, up from 26% in 2019, while their six largest European rivals took just 12%.
""What the US banks have done really well – and scale helps quite a bit – is that they've consistently invested in technology in their capital markets businesses. That makes them much more resilient,"" Shehu Beetz said. 
That is reflected in valuations. 
None of the ten largest European banks by assets has a price to book ratio above one, according to Refinitiv data, while only Citigroup among their U.S. equivalents dips below 1, showing the gulf in how investors value lenders from the two continents.
REBOUND POTENTIAL
European banks that lend heavily to home buyers such as Dutch ING, are hopeful that the rock bottom interest rates used to lift the region out of the financial crisis more than a decade ago could finally be coming to an end.
Late last year, ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said the gradual rise in interest rates would trickle down to make its lending business more profitable in the medium term. 
In Britain, central bank interest rates are rising after years near zero, helping banks such as Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and NatWest make more from lending, with the European Central Bank expected to follow suit in 2023 if not sooner.
European lenders have also largely avoided amassing mountains of bad loans as corporate borrowers weathered the COVID-19 pandemic.
A combination of fewer than expected soured loans in the pandemic and, until recently, curbs on shareholder payouts and banker bonuses from central banks, mean lenders have generally built up healthy capital buffers. 
""The (loan) moratoria are almost gone and banks still have quite a lot of (bad loan) provisions that they can take back,"" said Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments.
Investors hope higher capital levels will translate into bumper dividends and share buybacks. But banks could also take advantage of their replenished firepower to invest for the long term, in areas such as digital services and wealth management.
""The banking system has proven to be able to cope … Enough is enough now, and the focus has to be on what you do with that excess capital,"" said Oliver Judd, senior credit research analyst at investor  Aviva  (LON:AV).
""I'm looking for strategies. That's what's been missing for two years.""
One constraint on these ambitions is likely to be spiralling wage demands, a trend seen across U.S. banks in recent weeks.
Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Tuesday set a dour tone for European earnings, warning of a fourth-quarter loss, but analysts said the scandal-hit bank's troubles should not impact the rest of the sector.
Cross-town rival UBS should report more positive earnings on Monday, extending a recent winning streak that saw it post its highest quarterly profit since 2015 in October.
On Thursday, Germany's Deutsche Bank nearly tripled its fourth-quarter profit, defying expectations for a loss, as revenues at the investment bank rose. It marked the bank's longest streak in the black since 2012. 

Other European heavyweights set to report include Italy's UniCredit on Friday, Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) on Wednesday, and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) on Feb 8.
Britain's big banks are likewise expected to report relatively robust earnings, with Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) first on Feb. 17 followed by NatWest the next day, HSBC on Feb. 22,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Feb. 23 and Lloyds on Feb. 24.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wealth manager St. James's Place said on Thursday its funds under management hit a record 153.99 billion pounds ($206.76 billion) in the fourth quarter, as it brought in 2.91 billion pounds of net new money. 
Total net inflows during 2021 came to 11.04 billion pounds, representing 8.5% of opening funds under management, helped by pandemic savings continuing to flow in.

(Reuters) - Foreign investors have been cutting their holdings of Indian equities over the past few months, but domestic mutual funds, banks and insurance companies have helped put a floor under the market with their buying.
According to the data from National Stock Exchange of India, foreigners have sold $7.24 billion between Oct. 1 and Jan. 25, but domestic Indian institutions purchased $9.63 billion in that period. 
Graphic: Domestic and foreign institutional investments in Indian markets- https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-EQUITYFLOWS/INDIA-EQUITYFLOWS/znvnejdenpl/chart.png
Analysts said the rise in domestic investments is due to the surge in retail interest in the equity markets as the country's young investors pick stocks over other traditional assets.
""People start to see rising incomes and put more money in investments for their future and there is a greater willingness to hold assets like equities. A few decades ago most people would only save in cash, jewelry or gold and property,"" said Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), chief Asia equity strategist at HSBC. 
""Hence, we see continued buying from retail investors. They buy ETFs, funds and pick stocks themselves too.""
Data from Association of Mutual funds in India showed funds amassed 328 billion Indian rupees ($4.38 billion) through systematic investment plans (SIPs) in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 40% higher than a year before.
Graphic: Mutual fund SIP flows into Indian equities- https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-SIPFLOWS/INDIA-SIPFLOWS/lbvgnjqkqpq/chart.png
SIPs are more popular among retail investors as they allow them to invest a fixed amount regularly, and their returns are less volatile than lump sum discretionary stock investments. 
This domestic support could protect Indian markets against global volatility as the U.S. Federal Reserve gets set to raise interest rates rapidly in efforts to combat higher inflation. 
Many emerging market stock indexes have slumped in the past few weeks as foreigners aggressively sold riskier markets, while chasing higher U.S. yields and preparing for a hit to earnings.
However, India's Nifty 50 index has shed just 2% so far this month, compared with MSCI Asia-Pacific index's decline of 5%.
Some analysts said India's higher stock valuations could deter foreign investors, but domestic investors would continue to accumulate shares.
According to Refinitiv data, India's large and mid-cap stocks' forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stood at 20.1, the highest in Asia.

""In India alternative assets to hedge inflation are difficult to find, which, we believe, explains investors' liking for equities,"" said Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

""That situation seems unlikely to change in the medium term, implying that domestic institutional investment flows could continue to remain a bulwark to the market.""

Meta, formerly  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), first unveiled plans for Diem, known as Libra earlier, in June 2019, as part of an effort to expand beyond social networking into e-commerce and global payments.
The project immediately ran into fierce opposition from policymakers globally, who worried it could erode their control over the money system, enable crime, and harm users' privacy.
In the quest for regulatory approvals, Facebook then renamed its digital coin to 'Diem' and scaled down its global ambition to focus on the United States by announcing the launch of a U.S. dollar stablecoin, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to a traditional currency.

A much recent blow came when Facebook's financial technology executive David Marcus, who was overseeing its efforts to develop Diem, left the company to start working on something new.
Meta and Silvergate did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside business hours.

On Wednesday, the ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Rocking In the Free World"" singer thanked his record label for ""standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from Spotify,"" and he encouraged other musicians to do the same.
""Spotify has become the home of life threatening COVID misinformation,"" he said on his website. ""Lies being sold for money.""

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) shares tumbled on Thursday, as investors expressed skepticism about the company's thinly detailed plan to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place in six months.
The developer’s Hong Kong shares tumbled 6.21% to HK$1.66 ($0.21) by 11:56 PM ET (4:56 AM GMT), after falling as low as HK$1.6 earlier in the session. This was near its lowest level in almost two weeks.
Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index also slid 2.41%, part of a downward trend in Asian shares after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled forthcoming interest rate hikes in its policy decision handed down on Wednesday. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index also slid 2.5% on Thursday.
China Evergrande executives told creditors in a call late on Wednesday that the company hopes to work with them to achieve a risk management solution. The company added that it would treat all categories of creditors ""fairly and follow international practice"", while also urging them not to take any ""aggressive legal actions.""
However, some bondholders remained disappointed after the 25-minute call, which included prepared answers to questions. They said the call failed to give any insight into the company's plans.
The company’s communication with creditors comes as Chinese authorities tighten control over the property developer and adopt measures to stabilize the debt-ridden property sector.
China Evergrande, once one of the country’s top developers, now has a debt pile of more than $300 billion and continues its struggle to repay its creditors, suppliers, and investors in wealth management products.
The company missed some dollar bond payments in December 2021, triggering calls for communication, and nearly $20 billion of its international bonds are now deemed to be in default."

(Reuters) - U.S. cities and counties have embraced a proposed settlement worth up to $26 billion resolving lawsuits alleging three large drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, lawyers behind the deal said on Wednesday, increasing the odds that it will move forward.
About 90% of local governments nationwide that were eligible to participate in the settlement with McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and J&J had opted to do so by a Wednesday deadline, said Peter Mougey, a plaintiffs' lawyer involved in the negotiations.
Those municipalities and counties are located in 45 states and several territories that had earlier agreed to settle with the three largest U.S. drug distributors after the proposed settlement was announced in July.
Forty-four states will settle with J&J. New Hampshire settled with the distributors but is still suing J&J for billions of dollars. It is one of five states that declined to settle with all or some of the companies.
""To get 6,000 cities and counties to agree on anything at the 90% level in 90 days is unprecedented,"" Mougey said. ""It demonstrates the strength and power of this settlement.""
In California, over 400 cities and counties, or 97%, joined, putting the most populous state a step closer to receiving more than $2 billion from the settlement and ""closing this dark chapter,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.
J&J in a statement said it is evaluating the level of participation by eligible local governments. The distributors did not respond to requests for comment.
The deal aims to resolve thousands of lawsuits by state and local governments and future cases they could bring seeking to hold the companies responsible for an opioid abuse crisis that has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths.
The distributors agreed to pay up to $21 billion, while J&J agreed to pay up to $5 billion. The money is largely intended to fund treatment and other programs to address the health crisis.
How much the companies ultimately pay depends on state and local government participation. About $10.7 billion was tied to local government participation.
The companies have until Feb. 25 to decide whether to proceed with the deal.

Mougey, a partner at the law firm Levin Papantonio, said that by mid-Wednesday, 3,010 local governments pursuing lawsuits against the distributors agreed to settle, along with 3,405 with populations of over 10,000 that had not filed a lawsuit.
He said 3,038 local governments that sued J&J have joined the deal along with 3,324 non-litigating ones.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning, with U.S. Treasuries trimming a fall. Investors continued to digest U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s signal of an interest rate hike as soon as March 2022, with more to follow.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.47% by 9:20 PM ET (2:20 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI slid 2.94%, with Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) missing profit estimates.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.11%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.69% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.29%.
U.S. shares gave up gains from a rally on Wednesday but were edging upwards. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was around 1.85%, and the gap between five- and 30-year yields was almost the narrowest since early 2019.
Powell’s comments accompanied the Fed’s latest policy decision, handed down on Wednesday. Although he did not provide a specific timetable, Powell emphasized the central bank’s determination to curb high inflation, with the Fed likely to commence asset tapering after hiking borrowing costs.
The imminent possibility of a tighter Fed monetary policy has driven a selloff in stocks and bonds in 2022 to date. Investors will now have to adjust to central banks withdrawing COVID-19-era stimulus but are also weighing the risks to economic recovery.
The Fed meeting “played out more hawkishly than we expected,” Standard Chartered Bank global head of G-10 FX research Steven Englander said in a note.
“The statement was largely as anticipated, but Powell emphasized upside risks to inflation, pointing to a steady pace of policy withdrawal.”
The South African Reserve Bank will also hand down its policy decision later in the day. Investors also await U.S. data, including GDP and core durable goods orders, due on the same day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. stocks retreated Wednesday, erasing strong gains, after the Federal Reserve signaled an interest rate hike could be coming soon, while supply concerns stemming from tension between Russia and Ukraine saw oil prices touch highs not seen since 2014. 
Wall Street ended the day in mixed territory after spending most of the day up roughly 2%. Stocks shed those gains following an afternoon policy update from the Fed and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which suggested the Fed would push forward with interest rate hikes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.38%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite gained just 0.02%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was largely flat.
In its latest policy update, the Fed signaled it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings.
In the follow-up press conference, Powell warned that inflation remains above the Fed's long-run goal and supply chain issues may be more persistent than previously thought. Stocks turned negative during his comments, as some investors bet the Fed would prioritize fighting inflation over ensuring robust economic growth.
""The market took notice of the stress the Fed Chair put on the inflation side of the equation combined with his stressing of the tight labor market. This implies that the Fed could be comfortable with some reduction in the pace of overall economic growth,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services.
The Fed also said its policy-setting members had agreed on a set of principles for shrinking its balance sheet, set to start sometime after interest hikes begin. The Fed's balance sheet roughly doubled in size during the pandemic to nearly $9 trillion, as it snapped up bonds to help keep longer-term interest rates down to support the economy.
U.S. Treasury yields rose as the Fed issued its update. The U.S. Treasury 2-year yields hit their highest level since February 2020. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield climbed to 1.8709% shortly after the Fed statement.
The dollar hit a three-week high after the Fed news. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.58%.
Spot gold prices were down 1.64% to $1,817.31 an ounce.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 08:36PM ET</span>","Tesla forecasts 2022 growth above 50%, despite supply chain challenges","By Hyunjoo Jin and Nivedita Balu
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Wednesday forecast vehicle deliveries would comfortably grow by more than 50% year-over-year in 2022 despite persistent supply chain issues that it expects to be alleviated only next year.
The upbeat outlook from CEO Elon Musk came after the world's most valuable automaker posted record quarterly revenue that beat Wall Street expectations.
But the cautious note about supply chain woes showed that even Tesla cannot avoid the shortages that were pitfalls for many larger automakers last year. Shares fell 0.8% after hours. 
Tesla, which produced a few cars at its Berlin and Texas factories last year, said scaling up production there would depend on supply chain headwinds and the successful introduction of new technologies. 
Musk said that Tesla would not roll out new models this year but hopefully would launch its Cybertruck, Semi and Roadster next year. Tesla said it is not currently working on a $25,000 model that Musk promised in 2020 would launch in three years.
Revenue rose to $17.72 billion in the fourth quarter, above analyst estimates for $16.57 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla has fared better than most automakers in managing supply chain issues by using less scarce chips and quickly re-writing software. The automaker last quarter handed over a record number of vehicles to customers despite supply chain headwinds. 
""We still expect to be partly or primarily chip limited this year,"" Musk said during a conference call, saying that chip limitations should be alleviated next year. 
He said Tesla's volume growth would comfortably exceed 50% from last year, meaning that Tesla expects to deliver more than 1.4 million vehicles this year.
Tesla said the goal would be achievable even with current factories at Fremont, California, and Shanghai. 
Tesla said its Texas factory will this quarter deliver its first vehicles equipped with its next-generation 4680 batteries made in California as planned. 
Musk said he expected Tesla's vehicles to achieve full self-driving capability this year. Currently humans are required to sit behind the wheel to drive the car if needed.
""I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving, safer-than-human this year,"" he said. 
The number of full self-driving beta vehicles in the United States increased to nearly 60,000, up from a few thousand at the end of September. Tesla has been testing the improved version of its automated driving software on public roads, but it has said the features do not make the cars autonomous.
Tesla's $4.09 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat the consensus estimate of $3.89 billion, according to Refinitiv. That appeared to qualify Musk for an additional options payout under his 2018 compensation package.

Quarterly profits took a $340 million hit from payroll taxes related to Musk exercising options related to his 2012 compensation package. 
The profits also reflected rising raw material, commodity and logistics costs and expenses related to warranties and recalls. Tesla is recalling more than 475,000 of its Model 3 and Model S electric cars to address rearview camera and trunk issues that increase the risk of crashing.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc has delayed production of its much-awaited Cybertruck, aiming to start in 2023, chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday, at a time when rivals are doubling down on efforts to capture the lucrative market.
The announcement confirms a Reuters report from earlier this month and comes as the electric-vehicle maker reported record quarterly revenue and 2022 deliveries growing more than 50%, despite supply chain issues.
Musk, who unveiled the futuristic vehicle in 2019, had already delayed its production from late 2021 until late 2022. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will prepare to launch Cybertruck, Semi and Roadster as well as its humanoid robot next year, he said. 
""We will not be introducing new vehicle models this year. It would not make any sense because we'll still be parts constrained,"" Musk said on a call with analysts. 
He said additional products ""would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered this year."" 
Musk said he hopes to produce a quarter million Cybertrucks annually but achieving this will take time because of a lot of new technology to be introduced. 
""Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production,"" he said. 
""I worry more about like how do we make the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology,"" he said. 
Earlier in January, Reuters reported Tesla delayed its Cybertruck production as it changes features and functions in the face of rising competition in the electric pickup market.
Tesla, which began making electric vehicles with the premium sedan, Model S, and later introduced a more affordable car, the Model 3, has yet to launch in the highly profitable pickup truck segment currently dominated by fuel-guzzling vehicles from U.S. automakers.
Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1486143850368360448?s=20 on Tuesday he has been driving the latest Cybertruck prototype around the new Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, adding: ""It's awesome"". 

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Rivian Automotive have raced ahead of Tesla in launching electric pickups. Rivian has started deliveries of its R1T pickup truck, while Ford is set to start deliveries of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup in spring this year. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM)' Silverado electric pickup, unveiled earlier this year, will begin production in 2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Wednesday, taking an abrupt nosedive that reversed earlier solid gains after the U.S. Federal Reserve released its statement at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gyrated wildly in the final minutes of a session that ended with the Dow joining the S&P in negative territory and the Nasdaq eking out a nominal gain. 
The indexes enjoyed a brief surge after the Federal Open Markets Committee left key interest rates near zero. But those gains quickly evaporated as the Fed statement warned it would soon begin raising the Fed Funds target rate to combat persistent inflation related to the COVID-hobbled supply chain.
""With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the statement said.
Stocks slid into negative territory once Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A got under way, during which he warned that inflation remains above its long-run goal and supply problems are bigger and more long-lasting than previously thought. 
""When reporters asked Powell if the Fed would consider raising rates at every meeting, which would mean more than four times this year, he didn’t say they wouldn’t, which indicates a flexibility to raise rates much more quickly (if necessary) than anyone was expecting,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 129.64 points, or 0.38%, to 34,168.09, the S&P 500 lost 6.52 points, or 0.15%, to 4,349.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.82 points, or 0.02%, to 13,542.12.
While all 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 spent much of the trading day green, by the time the dust settled only tech and financials showed gains.
Fourth-quarter reporting season has hit full stride, with one-fifth of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 81% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:36PM ET</span>","Casual denim trend, higher prices fuel Levi's upbeat forecast","(Reuters) -Levi Strauss & Co forecast annual sales and profit above analysts' estimates after topping quarterly results on Wednesday, bolstered by higher prices and strong demand for its jeans and jackets, sending its shares up 8% after the bell.
People shopping for casual outdoor clothing as pandemic restrictions eased and a resurgence in retro fashion styles such as high-rise and loose-fitting jeans have buoyed demand for the company's denims. 
The Signature and Levi's (NYSE:LEVI) 501 jeans maker said it expects revenue between $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2022, compared with analysts' estimates of $6.37 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The robust demand has, however, coincided with increased production and shipping costs, forcing companies to raise prices to offset the inflationary pressures.
Levi plans to raise prices further in 2022 and beyond, Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said on a call with analysts, adding that demand outstripped supply in the quarter due to supply chain snarls. 
Lower promotions, more full-price selling and the reopening of its European and Asian markets also lifted the Denizen brand owner's sales in the reported quarter. 
Compared to pre-pandemic levels, Asia net revenue was flat in the three months ended Nov. 28, recovering from a 23% slump reported in the third quarter.
Net revenue rose 22% to $1.69 billion in the fourth quarter, edging past analysts' estimate of $1.68 billion.
Excluding items, Levi earned 41 cents per share, a cent above expectations.

Holiday season sales came in above its expectations, the company said, in contrast to downbeat estimates from retailers including  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
San Francisco-based Levi expects adjusted full-year profit per share between $1.50 and $1.56, compared with estimates of $1.52.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:35PM ET</span>",FAA chief to testify at U.S. House hearing on 5G impact on aviation safety,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is set to testify before a Feb. 3 U.S. House of Representatives hearing on new C-Band 5G deployment and its impact on aviation safety, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is expected to hear from FAA Administrator Steve Dickson along with aviation and wireless industry officials. These include the head of Airlines for America, a trade group representing passenger and cargo airlines, and Aerospace Industries Association, which represents airplane manufacturers. 
""I hope Administrator Dickson and all of our witnesses come prepared for a robust discussion about how the goal of a successful 5G deployment can co-exist with the safety of our skies,"" Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said in a statement to Reuters.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed on Jan. 18 to delay switching on new telecom towers near key airports even as they turned on the new 5G C-Band service. 
Radio altimeters are used to give data on height above ground for bad-weather landings and the 5G technology could cause interference, the FAA has warned. 
Last week, major U.S. passenger and cargo carriers warned of a potential ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis and said that without a delay of 5G deployment near some airports ""the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded.""
The FAA, which did not comment on Dickson's planned testimony, said Tuesday it issued approvals for additional altimeters that allow about 90% of the U.S. commercial aviation fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where 5G wireless is deployed.
The FAA cleared seven additional altimeters, bringing the total approved to 20.
Verizon agreed to temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution.
The issue is disrupting some landings in poor weather at smaller airports especially among regional jets, and there are still serious concerns about what happens when wireless carriers turn on those towers near airports.

""We are now seeing the operational impacts to airline travel,"" DeFazio said. ""All interested parties must come together to address these impacts and implement long-term solutions that will increase safety and reduce disruptions for affected airports.""
Airplane models with cleared altimeters include Boeing (NYSE:BA) 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787 MD-10/-11; Airbus A300, A310, A319, A220, A320, A321, A330, A340, A350, A380; Embraer 120, 170, and 190 regional jets; All CL-600/CRJ regional jets; DHC-8 and ATR turboprops.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:26PM ET</span>",Dearth of chips drives UK car production to lowest since 1956,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - British car production last year fell to its lowest since 1956, largely due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips that caused automakers to slow or shutter plants while waiting for parts, an industry group said on Thursday. 
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said production fell 6.7% from 2020 to 859,575 vehicles and was 34% below the pre-pandemic year 2019. 
""Overall, this was a deeply depressing year,"" SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes told reporters. ""The impact of the semiconductors really hit home hard in the last quarter of last year.""
The SMMT said it expected the shortage to ease this year and cited independent production forecasts that British car output should increase 19.7% to above 1 million vehicles.
The pandemic-fuelled shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors and power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up both new and used vehicle prices amid robust demand from consumers.
The overall fall in British car production was also partly caused by the long-planned closure of Honda's vehicle plant in Swindon.
One bright spot was that Britain's electric vehicle production rose 72% last year.

The SMMT said earlier this month that fully-electric BEVs accounted for 11.6% of sales in 2021 - more than the cumulative sales for 2016 to 2020.
Hawes said that while the government's Brexit deal had resulted in additional costs in 2021 for carmakers to handle increased bureaucracy in trade with the European Union, the industry had avoided the tariffs that would have accompanied a ""no deal"" rupture with the economic bloc.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>",Ackman's Pershing Square takes new position in Netflix,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire investor William Ackman has built a new stake in streaming service Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) worth more than $1 billion since its stock price tumbled starting last Thursday.
Ackman told investors that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, started buying on Friday and now owns more than 3.1 million shares in Netflix, making Pershing Square a top 20 shareholder.
In a letter to his clients, Ackman praised the company's ""best-in-class management team"" and on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) the manager said he has long admired Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and the ""remarkable company he and his team have built.""
Netflix shares climbed as much as 5% in after-hours trading. They had tumbled more than 30% in the last five days, a much steeper swoom than the broader market. After the market closed last Thursday, Netflix forecast weak subscriber growth. 
Ackman, whose firm invests $22.5 billion, wrote that he had been analyzing Netflix at the same time he was investing in Universal Music Group (AS:UMG) and was ready to buy when Netflix' ""stock price declined sharply last Friday.""
""Now with both UMG and Netflix, we are all-in on streaming as we love the business models, the industry contexts, and the management teams leading these remarkable organizations.""
To raise the cash to make the Netflix purchase, Ackman said the firm unwound a big piece of its interest rate hedge which generated profits of $1.25 billion.
He said that if he had not sold the hedge, his performance would have been better. His Pershing Square Holdings lost 13.8% in the first three weeks January, the worst start to a year for the manager in years.
Last year Ackman posted a gain of 26.9% after the fund surged 70.2% in 2020.
Ackman said Netflix benefits from highly recurring revenues, adding the company has pricing power and delivers industry-leading content.
Pershing Square traditionally holds only a small number of investments which currently include Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), and Dominos Pizza Inc. 
He said these companies are high quality businesses that can withstand inflationary pressures because they are able price their products to preserve profits. 

Netflix' stock price surged during the pandemic as live performances were shut down and movie theaters were largely off limits.
The company has been a favorite with prominent investors before. Roughly a decade ago Carl Icahn, an activist investor like Ackman, took a 10% position in Netflix and thought the company might need to sell itself to a technology company as its shares were undervalued. Ackman, who has pushed other companies to perform better, appears to be approaching this investment as a friendly investor. ""We are delighted that the market has presented us with this opportunity,"" he wrote on Twitter.

(Reuters) -  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) on Tuesday highlighted steps it has taken to avoid imposing trading restrictions and said it was in a ""strong position"" to support customers through unlikely market events, in a blog post published almost one year after a social-media-fueled rally that rattled markets.
The online trading platform, which helped pioneer commission-free trading, and several other brokerages on Jan. 28, 2021, restricted trading in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a handful of other ""meme"" stocks as the regulatory deposit requirements for settling the securities skyrocketed during the rally driven by retail investors.
Robinhood said in Tuesday's blog post that its net capital position was $2.8 billion, 21 times what is currently required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Those restrictions had infuriated clients trying to buy and sell the ""meme"" stocks.
Early this year, Robinhood asked a federal judge in Miami to dismiss a lawsuit alleging it engaged in fraud and market manipulation when it restricted trading in the stocks.
Robinhood last year also said it had increased the size of its customer support team and introduced 24-hour customer phone support, seven days a week.

Analysts on average expect Robinhood to report a $355 million loss when it posts its December-quarter results on Thursday after the bell. 
Following a slowdown in stock market trading by retail investors, shares of Robinhood, which went public last July, have fallen by about 66% from its IPO price.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:16PM ET</span>",Amazon workers eligible to hold union election at New York warehouse -NLRB,"By Julia Love
(Reuters) -A group of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers has met the requirements to hold a union election at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, a spokesperson for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board confirmed on Wednesday, paving the way for another high-profile labor battle at the online retailer. 
NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado wrote in an email that group of workers, known as the Amazon Labor Union, had ""reached a sufficient showing of interest."" In order to hold an election supervised by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, unions must show that they have gathered signatures of support from at least 30% of workers who are eligible to vote.
""We are jumping for joy,"" said Chris Smalls, president of the group and a former employee at the Staten Island warehouse. ""We know it’s a long battle ahead of us, but to get over this hump, the show of interest, it’s definitely historic for us.""
The Amazon Labor Union, which is not affiliated with a major U.S. union, withdrew its petition https://www.reuters.com/world/us/amazon-worker-group-new-york-withdraws-petition-organize-union-2021-11-12 in November after the NLRB notified them that they had not collected enough signatures. But on Wednesday afternoon, the NLRB told the group that they had cleared the hurdle, Smalls said. 
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the company was seeking more information about how the signatures were verified.
“We’re skeptical that there are a sufficient number of legitimate signatures,"" Nantel said in a statement. ""Our employees have always had a choice of whether or not to join a union, and as we saw just a few months ago, the vast majority of our team in Staten Island did not support the ALU.”

The NLRB will hold a hearing regarding the upcoming election on Feb. 16.
Amazon is facing a growing volley of campaigns to organize its vast workforce. Next month, workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama will vote again on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). Amazon handily defeated the union campaign last year, but the NLRB called for another vote after finding the company improperly interfered in the first contest.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:11PM ET</span>","Intel posts record quarterly revenue, sees supply strains through year","By Jane Lanhee Lee and Chavi Mehta
(Reuters) -Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) posted record fourth-quarter revenue, but forecast first-quarter earnings short of Wall Street expectations, as the world's largest chipmaker faces challenges linked to persistent global supply chain problems.
Intel shares, which initially fell about 3% in late trade, recovered some ground after the company expressed confidence in demand for its chips and the ability to manage supply chain constraints.
However, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Gelsinger said on a conference call that he expected those constraints to persist this year and into next year as the ""unprecedented demand"" for chips continued.
The company forecast first-quarter earnings per share of 80 cents, compared to an expectation of 86 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Intel's gross margin forecast of 52% fell within a previous range it projected for the next two to three years, but the figure raised concerns.
""With the high capex spend planned, we think Intel's gross margin could come under more pressure,"" said Kinngai Chan, a senior chip analyst at Summit Insights Group.
The outlook overshadowed fourth-quarter results, which Tony Balow, Intel's vice president of investor relations, said was a record and surpassed expectations. Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $19.5 billion, above an expectation of $18.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, ahead of 91 cents expected by analysts.
Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center business rose 20% to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter, also a record high for that category. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $6.73 billion, according to FactSet data. 
""We continue to see robust demand across all of our businesses. And then we see superb execution by our factory network, allowing us to go meet that demand in this challenging environment,"" Balow told Reuters after the earnings were released.
The company expects first-quarter revenue of $18.3 billion, above analysts' average estimates of $17.62 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The forecast places bets on its in-house chip-making capacity to meet strong demand from PC, data center and artificial intelligence markets even through a global semiconductor supply crunch. 
Intel, one of the few semiconductor companies that designs and makes its own chips, has been in a better position to weather supply chain challenges. 
Last week, Intel announced it https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-plans-new-chip-manufacturing-site-ohio-report-2022-01-21 was investing $20 billion for two chip factories in Ohio that could eventually become the world's largest chip making complex with up to eight planned.
Investors are watching how fast and how successful Intel ramps up those factories. Some analysts have raised questions of a glut coming at a time when not only Intel but rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. are also building factories.
""It's really up to Intel to execute this plan so they can show revenue growth above 10%, which is what they've guided to once the foundry business is up and running,"" said Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk.
Gelsinger said on the conference call that acute inflation will mean having the extra chip factory capacity will help balance cost and bring in healthy cashflow.

He also said that Intel could have other spin offs like the Mobileye (F:0ME) autonomous vehicle unit that it plans to list this year. Gelsinger said that process was ""progressing smoothly"".
""I won't say that's the last one that we'll consider for such moves,"" said Gelsinger. ""We see this as a formula for value creation that may have other areas that could benefit from such a purchase from the Intel family as we look to the future.""

Just a day earlier, the bank said 97% of its employees would get special compensation awards with a total value of nearly $1 billion, reflecting a 47% increase in its stock price last year.
Bloomberg News had reported earlier on Wednesday that Bank of America raised https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/bank-of-america-increases-base-pay-to-reward-top-tier-bankers?sref=V7uxlNge base salaries for its managing directors in investment banking and markets to $500,000 from $400,000. 
Directors can get a raise to as much as $350,000 this year, compared with $250,000 in 2021, while vice presidents will get a boost to $225,000, the report added. 
The bumper bonuses and salary raises underscore the pressure on Wall Street banks to retain their best performers.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its 2021 bonus pool for top-performing investment bankers by 40% to 50%, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) increased it by 30% to 40%, Reuters reported earlier in January.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group said on Wednesday it aims to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months as the debt-laden developer scrambles to reassure creditors spooked by defaults since its finances began to unravel last year.
The long-awaited communication came against the backdrop of Beijing tightening control over the property developer, while taking measures to stabilise China's crisis-hit property sector.
But some bondholders said they were disappointed by the 25-minute call with creditors, which included prepared answers to questions, saying it lacked insight on Evergrande's plans.
""(I had) no expectation prior to the call and no expectation after the call... frankly speaking, I believe the final decision making is led by the government, the company is relatively passive,"" said one offshore Evergrande bondholder.
The bondholder declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
Once China's top developer, Evergrande has racked up debts of more than $300 billion and is struggling to repay creditors, suppliers and investors in wealth management products. 
It missed some dollar bond payments last month, sparking calls for talks, and nearly $20 billion of its international bonds are now deemed to be in default.
Evergrande's newly-appointed executive director Siu Shawn, who is also chairman of Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd, said on the call with creditors that the group was working on a comprehensive restructuring plan.
Siu said Evergrande aimed to propose the plan within six months, adding the developer also hoped to work with creditors to achieve a risk management solution, a call participant who declined to be named due to confidentiality constraints, said.
Evergrande had on Monday sought more time from its offshore bondholders to work on a debt restructuring plan, after a group of creditors said they were ready to take ""all necessary actions"" to defend their rights.
""The board of directors and the risk management committee look forward to having further communications with investors and respectfully request (them) not to take any aggressive legal actions in order to maintain stability for the mutual benefits of all stakeholders,"" Siu said on the call.
In a Hong Kong stock exchange filing shortly after the call, the developer said it would continue to listen carefully to the opinions and suggestions of creditors.
TRANSPARENCY
The company's debt crisis has engulfed other Chinese developers, roiled global financial markets in the past year and contributed to a slump in China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of its economy. 
Evergrande had stayed largely silent about the status of its offshore credit since missing payment on dollar bonds for the first time in September. As Beijing tightened its grip, Evergrande has publicly said it planned to engage with offshore creditors.
The developer set up the risk management committee in December with mostly members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading its restructuring.
On Monday, Evergrande named Liang Senlin https://www.reuters.com/business/shares-china-evergrande-jump-after-report-restructuring-plan-be-released-soon-2022-01-24, chairman of China Cinda (HK) Holdings Company Limited, a unit of China Cinda Asset Management (1359.HK) - one of the country's four biggest state asset managers - as one of its board members.
Advisers for a group of offshore bondholders had demanded more transparency https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-markets-return-break-more-evergrande-angst-2021-10-07 from the developer.
""We noticed there are doubts about the transparency and the restructuring process of the group, we'd like to take this opportunity to explain to all creditors that the board of directors, the risk management committee and the group will work expeditiously to stabilize the group operation,"" Siu said. 
A member of the developer's risk management committee, Chen Yong, also joined the call, the participant added.
Chen is a compliance director of state-owned Guosen Securities. Andrew Huang, Evergrande's Hong Kong branch general manager, was also present, said the participant, declining to be named due to confidentiality constraints.
Responding to offshore creditors' concerns that they would be treated differently from those onshore, Huang said on the call that the company would treat all categories of creditors fairly and follow international practice.
""The call turned out to be disappointing. Not that I was expecting any fireworks, but still some insights on business would have been useful,"" Himanshu Porwal, an EM credit analyst at Seaport Global, said.
""Six months is a long time for (a) draft restructuring plan.""
Evergrande had asked bondholders to disclose their holdings by the middle of this week to identify investors for communications, and hired more financial and legal advisers to follow up on creditor demands.

Shares in Evergrande closed up 1.7% on Wednesday, while its defaulted dollar bond due April 2022 dropped to 15.997 cents on the dollar from 17.074 overnight, Duration Finance data showed.
Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in a report on Wednesday that covenant packages in Evergrande's offshore issuance had become increasingly lax, loosening or eliminating key protections, and putting the recovery prospects for offshore creditors in peril.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 04:57PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC to ramp up hedge fund, private equity fund scrutiny","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wednesday proposed new rules to boost hedge fund and private equity fund disclosures as it looks to increase oversight of the private funds industry and better monitor systemic risks. 
The private funds industry has drawn fresh scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-funds-regulation-analy-idUKKBN2A218L after hedge fund de-leveraging contributed toward turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market in March 2020 and hedge funds were again at the center of last year's GameStop (NYSE:GME) ""meme-stock"" saga.
""We'd had issues and challenges in private funds earlier and the transparency the U.S. government had into it was scant at best,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
The proposed changes to the SEC's ""Form Private Fund (PF)"" rules would require private funds to disclose details of material events within one business day, compared with the current quarterly or annual requirement, depending on the firm.
Form PF, which was introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, is the primary way private funds disclose purchases and sales of securities to the SEC.
The draft rule, which is subject to public consultation before it can be finalized, would also lower the Form PF reporting threshold for private equity funds from $2 billion in assets under management to $1.5 billion to capture more firms.
""After almost a decade of experience analyzing the information collected in Form PF, we have identified significant information gaps and situations where we would benefit from additional information,"" added Gensler. 
Separately on Wednesday, the SEC also proposed increasing the number of treasury trading platforms captured by the agency's Fair Access Rule, which prohibits platforms from unfairly denying or limiting access to such platforms. 
President Joe Biden's regulators have expressed concerns over private funds' excessive use of leverage, which raises the risk that firms will not have the ability to absorb even modest losses when hit by adverse shocks.
Last year, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) revived https://www.reuters.com/business/pressure-hedge-fund-scrutiny-builds-yellen-leads-her-first-us-financial-2021-03-31 a hedge fund working group, which President Donald Trump's administration had shuttered, to gather better data on risks hedge funds may pose to the financial system.
In 2013, private funds managed approximately $5 trillion in assets but that number grew to approximately $11 trillion by the end of 2020, according to an SEC official.
Wednesday's SEC measures would not see funds publicly disclose the new data, but would help regulators better spot signs of trouble, such as big losses, significant margin and counterparty default events, and other events associated with withdrawals and redemptions, the SEC said.
Noah Theran of the Washington-based Managed Funds Association, said that the group needed to review the proposal to ensure it does not ask funds to disclose ""routine activity.""
""We support the SEC’s broad goal of obtaining timely and relevant information from market participants in a crisis,"" he added.

David McGill at Kobre & Kim in Washington said the SEC will undoubtedly use the data to probe individual funds too.
""Ultimately, increased reporting is going to lead to increased investigating, and nothing gets investors to run for the door faster than a government investigation. Those practical realities provide plenty of motivation for funds to push back here,"" McGill said.

(Reuters) -Massachusetts' securities regulator on Wednesday charged Fidelity Brokerage Services with improperly ""rubber-stamping"" applications to trade options, saying the ""blatantly unethical"" practice allowed some ineligible retail investors to trade in meme stocks.
Secretary of State William Galvin said Fidelity, with 30.9 million retail brokerage accounts and $11.1 trillion of assets under management as of Sept. 30, betrayed a ""half-hearted and lackadaisical attitude"" toward investor protection when vetting applications for options and margins trading.
The administrative complaint against Fidelity came as regulators try to ensure that ordinary investors understand the risks of trading in options and other complex products, as smartphone apps make it easier to dive into securities markets.
Fidelity said it has cooperated fully with Galvin's office, but disagreed with how the complaint characterized the company.
""We have effective due diligence processes, and look forward to addressing and resolving this matter through the administrative process,"" Fidelity said in a statement.
Galvin said Fidelity's systems let investors submit multiple options trading applications containing ever-inflating claims, and failed to spot bogus claims of employment status, investing experience and financial wealth.
He said one investor submitted 11 applications in one week, including a sudden change in job title from ""Scientist"" to ""CEO,"" and upon winning approval traded options in meme stocks including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK).
Given the popularity of mobile apps and of options trading among young investors, ""broker-dealers need to make sure they're still maintaining the same standard of care and attention and making sure these investors qualify,"" Galvin said.
Massachusetts wants Fidelity to pay a civil fine, hire an independent compliance consultant and avoid future violations.
Options give investors the right but not the obligation to buy and sell stocks. Margin trading lets investors trade stocks with borrowed money. Both can result in higher or lower returns, and more risk, than from ordinary stock trading.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, as tech gave up some gains on surging U.S bond yields after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that there was plenty of runway to raise rates, with the first hike widely expected in March. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, after rising about 2% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%, or 129 points, and the Nasdaq was flat, erasing a 3% gain.
In his press conference that followed the Fed decision, Powell said there was ""quite a bit of room to raise rates without hurting jobs,"" stoking expectations that the Fed's plan to tighten monetary policy measures, which have underpinned risk assets, may be more aggressive than expected. 
The remarks arrived after the Fed said in a statement that it may ""soon"" be appropriate to raise rates, and confirmed plans to end its bond purchasing program in early March.     
""With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said in a statement. 
U.S. bond yields surged, putting a dent in growth sectors of the market like tech, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.

For the third-quarter, Microsoft guided revenue between $48.5 billion and $49.3 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates for $48.9 billion.
“Microsoft's cloud guidance was stronger than the Street and when factoring in F/X headwinds we would characterize this as a blowout guide in terms of how investors will digest these numbers” Wedbush said in a note.
The bullish results from the Microsoft helped steady sentiment on growth sectors of the market including consumer discretionary following days of selling.

The Federal Reserve as expected left rates unchanged but signaled its willingness to begin raising them in March.
It marks an aggressive shift in policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had previously downplayed how soon rate hikes would follow the end of the tapering.
Stubbornly high inflation has forced the Fed to rethink its stance. The Fed has flagged ""supply and demand imbalances"" as the key driver of elevated levels of inflation.
The improvement in the labor market has also served as another catalyst for the Fed to double up on efforts to combat inflation after the unemployment rate dropped under 4% to pre-pandemic levels.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 03:51PM ET</span>","Pfizer, Moderna shots safe during in vitro fertilization; healthy gut bacteria may help prevent long COVID","By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
mRNA vaccines safe during in vitro fertilization
COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA technology do not affect fertility outcomes during in-vitro fertilization (IVF), researchers have found.
They compared rates of fertilization, pregnancy, and early miscarriage in IVF patients who had received two doses of the vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) with BioNTech or ModernaO> with those in unvaccinated patients. The 222 vaccinated and 983 unvaccinated patients who underwent ovarian stimulation - medical treatment to stimulate development of eggs - had similar rates of eggs retrieved, fertilization, and embryos with normal numbers of chromosomes. The 214 vaccinated and 733 unvaccinated patients who underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer - where their eggs were collected from the ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory, creating embryos that were frozen and later thawed and transferred to the womb - had similar rates of pregnancy and early pregnancy loss, according to a report published on Tuesday in Obstetrics & Gynecology.
""Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in women who are trying to conceive,"" the researchers concluded.
Healthy gut bacteria may protect during COVID 
The bacteria living in your small intestine may contribute to the risk for long COVID after infection with SARS-CoV-2, new findings suggest.
Researchers analyzed the ""gut microbiome"" in 116 COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong in 2020, when regulations required that every infected person be hospitalized. More than 80% were mildly or moderately ill, but more than 75% had at least one persistent symptom. After six months, the most common symptoms were fatigue (reported by 31%), poor memory (28%), hair loss (22%), anxiety (21%) and sleep disturbances (21%), according to a report published on Tuesday in Gut. Analyses of stool samples obtained at hospital admission and over the succeeding months showed long COVID patients ""had a less diverse and less abundant microbiome,"" said Siew C. Ng of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Patients who didn't develop long COVID had a gut microbiome similar to that of people without COVID-19."" 
Lack of ""friendly"" immunity-boosting Bifidobacteria species was strongly associated with persistent respiratory symptoms, Ng noted. While the study cannot prove that healthy gut organisms prevent long COVID, the findings suggest ""maintaining a healthy and balanced gut microbiota via diet, avoidance of antibiotics if possible, exercise and supplementing with depleted bacteria species including Bifidobacteria"" might be helpful, she said.
New PCR test can identify variants
A new type of PCR test can quickly tell which variant of the coronavirus is causing infection, helping doctors choose the most effective antibody treatments, researchers said.
Most current PCR tests can check broadly for the presence of the virus but cannot identify specific variants. The new test uses special ""probes"" - fluorescently labeled molecules - called ""sloppy molecular beacons"" that glow in different colors when they attach themselves to DNA or RNA in the virus. When the sample from the patient is heated, the probes fall off their DNA or RNA targets and their color disappears. They fall off at different temperatures depending on the DNA or RNA sequence they were bound to. Because the variants each have some unique sequences, they can be identified based on the pattern of color changes at each temperature, explained Dr. David Alland of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.
""We have already performed a clinical study which showed that the assay was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying variants of concern including Delta and Omicron,"" Alland said. ""We are asking the N.J. Dept of Health to clear our test"" so that New Jersey labs can use it, he added. A typical hospital molecular laboratory would be able to perform it, his team reported on Friday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
U.S. study finds slight myocarditis risk with mRNA vaccines
There is a small but increased risk for heart muscle inflammation, or myocarditis, following receipt of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found.
The 1,626 cases documented in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System from December 2020 through August 2021 ""exceeded the expected rates,"" the researchers reported on Tuesday in JAMA. Overall, 73% of reported cases were in people under age 30, and 82% were males. The highest rates were found among adolescent and young adult males. For every million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, there were roughly 71 cases of myocarditis in males ages 12 to 15 and 106 cases in males ages 16 or 17. In young men ages 18 to 24, the rate per million doses was roughly 52 with the Pfizer shots and 56 after Moderna shots. About 96% of patients with myocarditis were hospitalized. In 87%, symptoms were gone by the time they were discharged. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common treatment.

""This risk should be considered within the context of the significant benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 infection and potential serious complications,"" said a spokesperson for the authors, who noted that COVID-19 itself confers a 16-times higher risk for myocarditis. ""The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh any potential risks.""

“Microsoft's cloud guidance was stronger than the Street and when factoring in F/X headwinds we would characterize this as a blowout guide in terms of how investors will digest these numbers” Wedbush said in a note.
The bullish results from the Microsoft helped steady sentiment on growth sectors of the market including consumer discretionary following days of selling.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is set to quarterly results due after the market closes, was well off the highs 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is set to report quarterly results on Thursday, was up more than 1%.

Investing.com —  Plug Power  Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares fell 1.2% despite Susquehanna starting coverage with a positive rating and $26 price target.
Analyst Biju Perincheril told clients in a note that the rating ""reflects Plug's top-line growth potential"" as the green hydrogen ecosystem develops over the coming years, which allows for ""the stock’s relatively rich valuation.""
""Although we have a relatively cautious view of the hydrogen market, we think Plug’s ability to provide integrated end-to-end green hydrogen solutions (from electrolyzers to hydrogen fuel, to fuel cells) will put it in a favorable position to generate double-digit annual top-line growth over the next decade,"" explained the analyst.
Plug shares initially climbed to a high of $21.35 on the back of the rating and comments from Susquehanna. However, it has since fallen to the $19.80 mark, after an overall market slide after the Fed signaled a potential March rate hike.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -A pay raise offer of 1% a year for workers made by lead oil industry negotiator Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is ""ridiculous,"" the United Steelworkers union said in a message to members on Wednesday.
""We didn't work from home during the pandemic. We showed up and kept our facilities running,"" the union said in the message, which was seen by Reuters. The message said the offer would give 30,000 U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers a 1% pay increase for each of three years under the contract being negotiated.
Marathon Petroleum spokesperson Jamal Kheiry said the negotiations are covering various topics.
""We are committed to bargaining in good faith and working toward a mutually satisfactory agreement,"" Kheiry said.
Under the current contract, which expires Feb. 1, workers received pay increases of 3.5% in each of the contract's first two years and 4% in the third and last year.

Going into talks, the union was seeking ""significant"" pay increases and improvements in health insurance, according to people familiar with deliberations over the summer within the USW who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Refiners and chemical producers began recovering in 2021 from large losses in 2020 when lockdowns and work-from-home policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 drove down motor fuel demand.

(Reuters) - Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Tuesday it is investing in indoor vertical farm Plenty as part of a $400 million funding round and will be buying leafy greens from them for its stores in California.
The investment in the South San Francisco startup that grows leafy greens under banks of lights is one of the biggest in the indoor farming business, and the distribution deal from Walmart is a sign of mass market appeal from an industry that has not delivered on early expectations. High costs have been a challenge for the industry.
Martin Mundo, the Walmart executive in charge of buying all produce for U.S. stores, declined to say how much Walmart was investing, only adding that it will have a board seat when the deal is closed. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, Walmart said.
Plenty, which secured SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision Fund 1 investment in 2017, recently said Arama Kukutai replaced the previous CEO and co-founder, Matt Barnard, who will remain as executive chairman of the board. 
Kukutai, who is also an early investor in Plenty, told Reuters that Plenty has been able to increase yield in its leafy green growing rooms by 700% in two years. He said raising yields was key to profit.
“Their path to yield is absolutely critical,” said Mundo about why Walmart chose Plenty over nearly a dozen other indoor farms it visited as it sees this as an environmentally sustainable way of farming. The fact that Plenty also has a path to growing strawberries and cherry tomatoes at scale, and not just leafy greens, was another advantage, he said.
In late 2020 Plenty raised funds from berry brand Driscoll’s and signed a joint development agreement to grow Driscoll’s strawberries.
Mundo said once Plenty’s new farm in Compton, California comes on line later this year, it will serve leafy greens to all of the Walmart stores in the state. 
Plenty isn’t alone in raising big funds in recent months. In May New York-based indoor vertical farming startup Bowery Farming raised $300 million in a round https://www.reuters.com/article/agriculture-indoor-farming-funding-idAFL2N2NA0LM that put the company valuation at $2.3 billion. Plenty declined to say how it was valued in this latest round of funding.
Still, others have struggled. AeroFarms said in October https://www.aerofarms.com/2021/10/14/terminate-business-combination its deal to list on the stock market through a blank check company was terminated. 
Michael Rose, a partner at Better Food Ventures which invests in food technology, said he has seen at least two companies forced to take a lower valuation to raise funds. But he added that was normal in industries with emerging technologies. 

“What we've seen during the pandemic is they're selling everything they can produce,” Rose said about the indoor farms. While they have been able to charge a premium for those salads for now, as they grow and compete on a bigger scale they will face pricing pressure, he said. 
“We're still early ... We're talking years down the road.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank signalled a more positive outlook on Wednesday saying it would undertake a 300 million euro ($339 million) share buyback and pay a dividend for 2021.
The measures reflect the improved financial state of Germany's largest lender, as well as a return to more normal times after regulators prohibited buybacks and dividends during the coronavirus pandemic.
The share buyback will be completed in the first half of this year, while the dividend has been set at 0.20 euro per share, the bank said in a statement. Analysts had expected the bank to pay a dividend of 30 cents for the year.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last paid a dividend of 11 cents in 2019 for 2018, and has not announced a major share buyback in years.
It said the two moves will give shareholders around 700 million euros in capital, adding that it represents a ""first step towards a previously announced commitment to return 5 billion euros of capital to shareholders over time"".
Shares in the bank traded 2.3% higher in Frankfurt after the announcement, which comes ahead of its earnings on Thursday.

Analysts expect Deutsche Bank to swing to a net loss for the fourth-quarter amid a slowdown in revenue at its investment bank.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 01:05PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer watchdog ups pressure on banks over fees,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog on Wednesday ramped up scrutiny of bank and credit card charges, seeking public comments about various ""junk fees"" consumers are charged by banks, from overdrafts to late fees.
The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau says U.S. banks have grown reliant on overdraft fees, which contributed $15 billion of revenue in 2019, and is considering ""regulatory interventions"" to increase transparency and competition. 
Under its new director, Rohit Chopra, who took up his position last October, the CFPB is targeting bank fees that are particularly unpopular with consumers, such as overdraft charges and non-sufficient funds fees, signaling an intent to whittle away at the fees it says harm consumers and pad banks' profits.
""In many cases junk fees act like penalties, like with non-sufficient funds and credit card late fees, rather than compensation for a legitimate service,"" Chopra said. 
Banks may charge customers for services that require the bank to take on extra risk, Chopra said, but ""many complain that these fees are far higher than the service is really worth.""
In recent months, banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) have made a variety of changes to existing overdraft policies, ranging from eliminating overdrafts altogether to allowing customers more time to bring their accounts above zero to reducing the fee the bank charges from $35 to $10.
""This is progress, but it is not enough,"" Chopra said.

The Consumer Bankers Association, an industry group, shot back at the CFPB's claims, saying overdraft fees contributed less than 2% of bank revenues in 2019, and that banks disclose the terms of those and other fees to consumers. 
The banking industry is well-regulated, supervised and competitive, said the group's president and chief executive, Richard Hunt. ""The (CFPB) should be focused on seeking feedback from and working in tandem with banks ... to recognize the value these products and services have in the lives of the people we are all working to serve.""

The Biden administration had previously vowed to donate a second tranche of 500 million doses to the COVAX global vaccine sharing program, raising its total pledge to some 1.2 billion COVID vaccine doses, with the latest batch expected to start shipping this month.
Global health experts have said at least 5 billion to 6 billion doses are needed by poorer countries to help protect them against the coronavirus amid the ongoing pandemic. 
Overall COVAX, backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, has delivered more than a billion doses to 144 countries and aims to achieve 70% COVID-19 immunization coverage by mid-2022.

Oil and gas producers globally are set to post higher revenues and profits for the last quarter, thanks to a more than 50% jump in oil prices in 2021. Brent crude prices averaged $80 per barrel in the last three months of 2021, nearly doubling from a year earlier.
The average selling price for Hess' crude rose 56.8% to $71.04 per barrel, including hedging, while gas prices jumped 42.4% to $4.77 per thousand cubic feet (mcf).
Oil and gas net production, excluding Libya, fell to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), from 309,000 boepd a year earlier.
Hess said it was on track to start production in the first quarter at its second platform in Guyana, home to one of the world's largest oil discoveries this century and considered a growth engine for the company.
That platform is part of the Stabroek block, in which  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) has a 45% stake, while Hess Corp has 30% and China's CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd holds 25%. 
Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a source, that Exxon plans to start production next month at its second oil platform in Guyana. 
Hess on Tuesday forecast higher output and capital spending for exploration and production this year.

Adjusted profit came in at $265 million, or 85 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $176 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.
That beat estimates for a profit per share of 74 cents, according to Refinitv IBES.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday met with family members of some of the victims of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes over the prior administration's decision to strike a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing.
In December, some victims' relatives said the Justice Department violated their rights when it struck the January 2021 agreement with Boeing over the two crashes in a five-month period that killed 346 people.
They argued the U.S. government ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process,"" and asked a judge to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution, which was part of the $2.5 billion agreement, and order the planemaker publicly arraigned on the felony charges.
Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, said that in the Garland meeting they ""expressed our view that the department under the previous administration ignored its obligations under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and our hope that he would intervene to right this wrong.""
The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
The January 2021 settlement allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution, and includes a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million crash-victim fund over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design.
The Justice Department deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.
In October, a former Boeing chief technical pilot for Boeing was charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. He has denied wrongdoing.

The crashes, which cost Boeing some $20 billion and led to the plane's 20-month grounding, which was lifted in late 2020, prompted Congress to pass legislation reforming new airplane certification.
The $243 million fine, which the Justice Department said was at the ""low end"" of the sentencing guidelines, represented the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia unit reported solid fourth-quarter revenue growth on Wednesday, helped by new customers for its HBO Max streaming service, but shares of AT&T fell 3% as the market absorbed whether its core wireless business could propel future growth.
After facing skepticism from investors over its expensive endeavor to become a media powerhouse, AT&T struck a deal to merge WarnerMedia with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, which it now expects to close in the second quarter.
The company will detail its plans to attract new types of wireless customers and how it will refine its brand post-WarnerMedia at a virtual analyst day in March, said AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey, during an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday.
AT&T will aim to have ""a much more crisp and intense focus,"" on its core wireless and internet business, Stankey said.
Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, wrote in a note on Wednesday that the rate of customer defections at AT&T increased ""materially,"" and it remained a question whether the company could sustain its wireless customer growth.
Investors were also disappointed in AT&T's growth guidance for the communications business, Chaplin said in an email.
The company signed up 884,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, in line with its preliminary result of 880,000 released earlier this month.
Rival carrier Verizon (NYSE:VZ) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 558,000 subscriber additions in its latest quarter.
Revenue at WarnerMedia, which houses premium TV channel HBO and streaming service HBO Max, rose 15.4% to $9.9 billion during the fourth quarter. 
WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said it was the business' highest revenue in its 99-year history, thanks to gains in streaming, the steady growth of its studio business and its game group. 
""That's one indication that what we're doing is working and resonating with audiences around the world,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
HBO and HBO Max together added 4.4 million subscribers during the quarter, drawing viewers with releases such as ""Dune"", ""The Matrix"" and the newest season of TV show ""Succession"".
Total consolidated revenue was $41.0 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' estimates of $40.44 billion, according to Refinitiv Data.
Excluding items, AT&T earned 78 cents per share, above analysts' average estimate of 75 cents.
AT&T has prioritized its fiber internet business as an area for growth, and said it added 271,000 net new customers during the quarter.
Including WarnerMedia and advertising business Xandr, AT&T now expects 2022 revenue growth in the low-single-digit percentage range.

The company expects annual adjusted earnings of between $3.10 and $3.15 per share in 2022, short of analysts' average estimate of $3.21.
AT&T, which faces fierce competition from rivals Verizon and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) amid nationwide deployment of their 5G technology, forecast 2022 capital expenditure in the $20 billion range.

Investing.com — Shares of Gatos Silver Inc (NYSE:GATO) plunged more than 69% Wednesday after revealing a technical report — the Los Gatos Project, Chihuahua, Mexico report — from July had errors and indications of an overestimation in the existing resource model.
The company estimates a potential reduction ranging from 30% to 50% of the metal content of Cerro Los Gatos' mineral reserve; therefore, ""the 2020 Technical Report should not be relied upon.""
""The company is working with independent engineering consultants to better understand the magnitude of the overestimation, including conducting a detailed reconciliation of production to previous models and reserve calculation estimates, as well as creating a new Life of Mine (""LOM"") plan,"" Gatos said in its statement. 
The company expects the work will be completed in the second half of 2022.
The resource overestimate could result in a credit facility default, leaving Gatos to seek a waiver from its lender. The company has $13 million outstanding under its credit facility as of Dec. 31. However, they believe they have sufficient liquidity to manage the process.
Analysts at RBC Capital and CIBC downgraded the stock. RBC's Michael Siperco said the disclosure ""is a significant negative event, and puts our estimates and valuation in question."""

(Reuters) -U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc on Wednesday issued a conservative annual profit forecast and warned that the highly contagious Omicron variant was likely to drive up treatment, vaccination and testing costs in the first quarter.
Since the start of the pandemic, profits of health insurers have come under pressure as huge costs related to direct COVID-19 treatment and tests cancel out any advantage gained from lower expenses due to delays in elective procedures. 
""We anticipate another year in which the overall cost of care will track above normalized levels driven by COVID-related treatment, vaccination and testing costs,"" Chief Financial Officer John Gallina said.
Anthem shares fell about 1.3% in early morning trading after the insurer forecast 2022 adjusted profit of at least $28.25 per share, below market expectation of $28.65, according to Refinitiv data and in line with its preliminary guidance.
The company's comments on medical costs combined with a largely in-line fourth quarter are weighing on Anthem's stock,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst A.J. Rice said. 
""I don't see anything that really changes our perspective on the stock. Anthem is one of the preferred names in managed care right now. This (stock move) will be short lived."" 
In contrast, rival UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) had last week predicted softer blow this year from the pandemic on expectation that added costs related to the Omicron surge would be offset by delays in non-urgent healthcare procedures.

Anthem said it expects annual benefit expense ratio - the percentage of premiums paid for medical services - to be between 87.5% and 88.5%. The midpoint is above analysts' estimate of 87.50%.
The lower the ratio, the better it is for a health insurer as it indicates a tight rein on costs. For Anthem, it was 87.5% in 2021, mainly due to rise in costs related to COVID-related care.

Investing.com – Kimberly-Clark stock (NYSE:KMB) fell 3.7% Wednesday as high raw material prices weighed on its annual outlook.
The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers is projecting its 2022 profit per share to be $5.60 to $6 on organic sales growth of 3% to 4%. This compares with 2021 EPS of $6.18 when organic sales fell 1%.
Net sales in the current financial year are seen increasing 1% to 2% compared to 2% growth in 2021.
“While we expect inflation and supply-chain disruption to persist into 2022, we are committed to recovering margins to pre-pandemic levels over time, and we are optimistic about gradual improvement later in the year,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Hsu said in a statement.
Sales of $5 billion in the fourth quarter rose 3% year-on-year, riding on price hikes. Kimberly said organic sales increased 3% during the quarter as net selling prices rose 2% and product mix increased sales 1%. Volumes were higher in personal care but fell in both consumer tissue and K-C Professional business.
Fourth quarter sales in personal care segment came in at $2.6 billion and were higher by 12%, driven by both price hikes and higher volumes. However, the consumer tissue segment suffered reverses. Sales fell 10% to $1.6 billion as both prices and volumes fell. Sales of these products were higher last year owing to Covid.

The gains were fueled, in part by investments in Vonage Holdings (NASDAQ:VG) Corp which sold itself last year for $21 a share. Legion had reached a settlement with the company in 2019 to add a director to the board and had been working behind the scenes.
Legion's 2021 returns beat the benchmark HFRI Activist Index' 19% return, as record setting market gains helped investors.
The firm, headquartered in Los Angeles, manages roughly $500 million in assets and is well known for having been part of a group that took on Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and settled for four new independent directors in 2019.
Last year, Legion's portfolio companies added 11 new directors to their boards. The firm has placed a heavy emphasis on corporate governance, gender and racial diversity. More than 44% of all the directors Legion has helped place on boards have been women.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>",Boeing posts loss as 787 jet deliveries stall with 'no firm end in sight',"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Wednesday it incurred $4.5 billion charges in the fourth quarter on its sidelined 787 program, obscuring the U.S. planemaker's long-awaited return to positive cash flow fueled by rebounding 737 MAX deliveries.
The planemaker sank to a loss after two quarters of profits because of the charges. Shares in Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 3.6% as the array of charges and uncertainty over the 787 program dwarfed a surprise return to positive free cash flow and plans to increase production on the 737 and 777.
The quarterly results underscore the challenges Boeing faces as it seeks to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic and 737 MAX safety crises, while navigating industrial and regulatory currents on its bigger 787 and 777X flagship. 
Its ability to resume deliveries to airlines depends on approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
Reuters reported last week that deliveries of the 787 are expected to remain frozen for months as U.S. regulators review repairs and inspections over structural flaws in the jets, while designs for the larger 777X face further regulatory pushback from Europe.
""We'll have to complete the rework on a large fleet of airplanes,"" Calhoun told analysts on a conference call later on Wednesday. ""There's no way to shortcut it ... I wish it could go faster, and I can't accelerate it.""
Asked whether deliveries would resume in April, as some people in the industry expect, Calhoun said the timing would be set by the FAA. 
The program remains at a low production rate, with an expected gradual return to five per month over time, Boeing said. Calhoun and Chief Financial Officer Brian West later told investors on a call 737 MAX deliveries and service would resume in China's crucial aviation market in the first quarter. 
Boeing unveiled a $3.5 billion pre-tax non-cash charge related to 787 delivery delays and customer concessions, and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs. 
Boeing had previously forecast low production rates and rework for the 787 due to manufacturing flaws and required inspections and repairs to result in about $1 billion of abnormal costs - putting the overall price tag at some $5.5 billion. 
""Here we go again,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said. ""Just as we saw with the 737 MAX, Boeing is now racking up massive charges on the 787 with no firm end in sight, and its fate in the hands of the FAA.""
HAIR-THIN GAPS
At its U.S. factories, Boeing is combing through parked 787s with ultrasound devices and tools to measure gaps barely visible to the naked eye. The gaps - left in the process for making carbon-composite structures that make the jet lighter and cheaper to fly - are the width of a human hair but violate Boeing's specifications. 
The company reported a core operating loss of $4.54 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $8.38 billion a year earlier, when the company recorded a $6.5 billion charge due to delays in its 777X jet program.
Still, Boeing generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter, representing its first positive cash quarter since early 2019, fueled by 737 MAX deliveries as air travel rebounds from the pandemic. 2023 cash flow would be ""materially"" higher than 2022, West said. 
Boeing said its 737 program was producing at a rate of 26 per month, up from 19 jets in the earlier quarter. It said it was on track to reach production targets of 31 per month in early 2022, though it faces supply-chain risks like labor and parts shortages.
Boeing currently has 335 737 MAX airplanes in inventory, and anticipates delivering most of those jets by end-2023, it said.
Boeing also said it aims to increase its 777/777X production to 3 aircraft per month in 2022 from 2 previously, fueled by orders for 777 freighters amid booming air cargo demand. It reiterated plans to deliver the first 777X in late 2023. 
Higher revenue and operating margins in its Global Services Division were hurt by an asset-impairment write down of $220 million due to fluctuating demand and pricing, Boeing said. 

Boeing also took a $402 million pre-tax charge on its KC-46 tanker program, due to changing customer requirements to the plane's remote vision system and supply chain disruptions. 
Debt fell to $58.1 billion from $62.4 billion at the beginning of the quarter, Boeing said.

(Reuters) -Abbott Laboratories on Wednesday beat quarterly profit and sales estimates, aided by robust sales of COVID-19 test kits and strong demand for its diagnostics products, but forecast lower-than-expected COVID-19 testing sales in 2022 due to uncertainties around the future of the pandemic.
The U.S. medical device maker traded down as much as 2.7% Wednesday morning following its earnings release.
Abbott said it expects $2.5 billion in sales of COVID-19 test kits in the early part of this year. The company will update its test kit estimates on a quarterly basis.
""COVID testing is going to still be around,"" said Chief Executive Officer Robert Ford during an investor call. ""The question is just how does it evolve over the next nine to 12 months.""
Test makers have grappled with choppy demand in the past few quarters as COVID infections have surged and plateaued in the United States, making it difficult to predict whether demand will hold up for the long term.
Analysts were expecting Abbott to be conservative with its COVID test forecast due to uncertainties around the pandemic.
The U.S. government in September announced plans to acquire billions of dollars worth of COVID rapid tests from manufacturers including Abbott in a bid to boost supplies around the country. [L1N2R228S]
Abbott said it would be closely looking at acquisition opportunities in medical devices and diagnostics tools this year. 
The Illinois-based company posted $2.3 billion in COVID test sales for the fourth quarter, including $2.1 billion in rapid tests. The overall COVID test sales were marginally lower than the $2.4 billion it reported a year ago.
The company had previously expected COVID test-related sales to be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion in the quarter.
Abbott forecast adjusted earnings from continuing operations of at least $4.70 per share for the year, below analysts' estimates of $4.78.
Fourth-quarter sales in Abbott's diagnostics business were $4.47 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $3.46 billion.

On an adjusted basis, Abbott earned $1.32 per share, beating estimates of $1.21, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Total sales were $11.5 billion, higher than the $10.7 billion estimated by analysts.

(Reuters) -Mattel Inc on Wednesday won the rights to produce dolls based on Disney royalty like Elsa and Jasmine, snatching back a highly lucrative license from archrival  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS).
The reunion sent Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT)'s shares surging 11% and is part of Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz's plan to turn the company around by getting more entrenched in big entertainment properties.
Mattel did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, which came seven years after it lost the rights and will also allow it to make dolls based on the ""Frozen"" movie franchise. 
""This is a defining moment in our transformation,"" Kriez said in an interview.
""This has been a key priority as part of our turnaround and we worked very hard to win it ... the way we see it Disney Princess and Frozen are back home where they belong.""
The toymaker has in recent years seen a resurgence in sales of the traditionally blonde Barbie doll thanks to new models with different skin tones, professions and attires that have struck a chord with a more diverse customer base.
Hasbro declined to comment but said it had renewed its licensing deal with Disney-owned Lucasfilm for ""Star Wars"" and would restart making products based on ""Indiana Jones"". 

Mattel will start selling the toys that would also feature dolls based on popular movies such as ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Brave"", and ""The Little Mermaid"" from 2023. 
The toymaker has struck similar deals with Disney for Pixar Animation Studio's ""Toy Story"" and ""Cars"" franchises, as well as ""Lightyear.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the small cap Russell 2000 hovers near bear market territory, some strategists are optimistic the index and U.S. stock market may be close to a bottom for the recent sell-off.
The Russell index of small capitalization stocks, often the most volatile of the major U.S. stock indexes, has led the way down in the recent market selloff. The index has been in an almost steady decline since hitting a record closing high on Nov. 8, while the S&P 500 last hit a record high close on Jan. 3.
As of Tuesday's close, the Russell was down 18% from its record close, and the S&P 500 is off about 9% from its closing all-time high. A close of 20% or more below a record high close confirms an index is in a bear market, while a close of 10% below a record confirms a correction, according to a widely used definition.
""It's been a bloodbath for small caps,"" said Steven DeSanctis, a small and mid-cap equity strategist at Jefferies. ""The average small cap stock is down about 40% from its 52-week high."" 
While the market's lows may not yet be in, ""this is part of the bottoming-out process,"" he said, and small caps are ""kind of the canary in the coal mine.""

Stocks were bouncing in early trading Wednesday. To be sure, with ongoing rate hike worries and fourth-quarter earnings season still in full swing, many investors remain cautious that the sell-off has further to go.
Investors have been spooked in recent months by spiking inflation and growing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy even more aggressively than the market has been bracing for. 
The Fed is due to release a statement later Wednesday following its two-day policy meeting, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference. Adding to this week's tensions, NATO put forces on standby and the United States put troops on heightened alert in response to a buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine's border.
Because they are more volatile than large caps, small caps often see bigger swings during periods of strong up moves and also in fast market downswings.
With the Russell, investors seem to be pricing in a recession, but that's not likely to happen, DeSanctis said. For these stocks, ""valuations are getting a lot cheaper. Earnings are holding up. I can't see it getting a lot worse from where we are today,"" he said.
In intraday trading Monday, the Russell fell below the critical 20% level from its November record closing high, before a late-day reversal helped the index to close up 2.3% on the day. It has yet to end 20% below its closing record.
Some strategists said hitting those low levels early in the session - especially in the Russell 2000 - may have triggered some buy signals.
""There's still a lot of cash on the sidelines, so people with cash are especially attuned to a time period like this,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The move in the Russell 2000, he said, ""might have been a bigger indicator than anything.""
Small caps may be looking especially attractive as prices have fallen.
The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Russell 2000 is now at 22.1, down from 28.1 in early November, according to Refinitiv data. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 19.7 is down slightly from 21.8 in the beginning of November.

Investing.com – F5 Networks stock (NASDAQ:FFIV) plunged 15% Wednesday as supply chain constraints led the cloud security company to lower its annual outlook.
“While demand for its solutions remains robust, the company expects that its ability to meet customers’ continued strong demand for systems will be restricted by supply chain constraints for the remainder of fiscal year 2022,” President and CEO François Locoh-Donou said in comments after releasing the company’s first quarter results.
F5 expects 2022 revenue growth to be 4.5% to 8%, down from its prior expectation of 8% to 9% growth.
The company’s projections for the current quarter also fell short of estimates and added to the pressure on the stock. F5 expects second-quarter revenue to be $630 million at the center of its guidance range. Even at the top end of $650 million, the second-quarter revenue is projected to be sequentially lower while being only $5 million more than year-ago.
The October-December revenue was higher by 10% year-on-year at $687 million, marking its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
The company said escalating demand for applications is driving its growth, currently being held back by supply shortages. The company said over the last 30 days, a decline in component availability is significantly restricting its “ability to meet customers’ continued strong systems demand”.
Operating margin eroded by 2.3 percentage points to 16.6%. Adjusted net profit rose 11% to $179 million and exceeded estimates."

MILAN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of ties between Russia's energy industry and Italy as he addressed Italian business leaders in a video-conference on Wednesday despite rising tensions over Ukraine.
The meeting with top Italian companies, including state-controlled  Enel  (MI:ENEI), went ahead despite a call from Rome for business executives not to attend.
Western leaders are stepping up preparations for any Russian military action against Ukraine and making plans to shield Europe from potential disruptions to Russian energy supplies.
Energy is one of the main issues on the agenda for Europe as surging natural gas prices have inflated energy bills for businesses and households. Russia supplies the European Union with around a third of its gas.
""I would like to underscore that we consider Italy as one of the leading economic partners,"" Putin said in opening remarks, noting that Italian energy companies were benefiting from long-term supply deals with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
He said Moscow was especially pleased with cooperation with Italian companies and banks on large-scale projects in the energy sector like Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2. 
An organiser of the event told Reuters the two-and-a-half hour meeting with top managers from 16 companies had lasted longer than expected and had been friendly and constructive.
""Putin never spoke about Ukraine or Italian politics,"" the head of the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce (CCIR) Vincenzo Trani said. 
Underscoring the business links between the two countries, industrial group Maire Tecnimont, also represented at the meeting, said on Wednesday it had won a contract from Russian oil group Rosneft worth 1.1 billion euros.
VIDEO LINK
Managers of big Italian companies, including power group Enel, the country's top two banks Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit and insurer Generali (MI:GASI) met Putin via the video link.
The Italian executives, who included UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel and Enel chief Francesco Starace, gathered in two luxury hotels in Rome and Milan.
""The meeting is a private initiative and there is no government involvement in it,"" an Italian government official said.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian ministers would attend the meeting as well as Igor Sechin, head of Rosneft and Dmitry Konov, head of petrochemical company Sibur.
The video call was organised by the CCIR and the Italian-Russian business committee chaired by Marco Tronchetti Provera, head of tyre manufacturer Pirelli.
Other companies scheduled to take part included state-controlled energy groups Eni and Saipem. But Eni said on Tuesday it would not attend, while a source said Saipem had also opted not to take part.
Eni has strategic long-term gas contracts with Russia and agreements with Rosneft which are on hold. Italy sources around 40% of its gas from Russia. 
Enel CEO Starace, whose brother Giorgio is the Italian ambassador to Moscow, took part in the meeting, pictures showed. The world's biggest private green energy group operates in Russia through Enel Russia and has renewable power ventures.
Trani said the energy transition and green technology had been one of the issues discussed as well as broader industrial ties. 

Italy was Russia's fifth biggest trading partner in 2020. Their trade in the first nine months of last year was up 44% on the same period the previous year.
Putin said around 500 Italian firms operated in Russia in sectors like energy, steel, and banking, investing around $5 billion in the economy.

However, analyst Ryan Brinkman reduced the price target to $205.00 from $225.00.
Brinkman told investors that the stock price has declined significantly since his double downgrade at the beginning of November — the company's shares fell from around $298 to Monday's lows of $162.50. Regardless, the analyst now sees a ""solid"" 21% upside in the shares, although explains that it is less than the potential upside of Hertz, which he prefers for its lower valuation. 
""Our target multiple is set above the historical average, reflecting partly structural increase in margin on greater perceived industry pricing power and further bolstering of financial condition,"" said Brinkman. The analyst believes the impact of the Omicron variant may be overblown."

""The credit servicing sector is evolving rapidly,"" doValue said in a statement, adding that companies operating in the industry must also change.
""Transformation means extracting more revenues per unit of gross book value managed ... (and) lower costs per unit of gross book value managed.""
To keep its loan portfolio at a stable level, doValue said it plans to secure new contracts for 13 billion-14 billion euros of debt a year over the 2022-2024 period under its new strategic plan.
The company, which was born from the spin-off of UniCredit's bad loan management unit, said it expected the improved collection rate to drive revenues up by 3-4% a year on average in the 2022-2024 period.
doValue, which also operates in Spain and Greece, said it forecast growth in all its three main markets, with Greece outperforming thanks to a strong pipeline of new inflows.
Greece's higher recovery rates and better margins will lead doValue to increase the relative weight of the country in its portfolio, it said.
To improve productivity, doValue said it plans to invest in technology, while also looking to branch out into data management and performing debt.
The company targets cumulative dividends of at least 200 million euros over the 2021-2024 period, which Citi analysts said in a note on Wednesday was higher than markets expected.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc on Wednesday reported a nearly 16% jump in fourth-quarter profit, topping Wall Street estimates, buoyed by the frenetic pace of U.S. initial public offerings, and strong demand for its investment-related products. 
Technology, healthcare and financial technology companies led the IPO rush during the quarter, including Rivian Automotive Inc's more than $100 billion debut.
Tech-heavy Nasdaq hosted 1,000 company listings in 2021, with 752 IPOs representing $181 billion in capital raised, including chipmaker GlobalFoundries Inc and crypto-exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global.
There are more than double the number of companies that have filed to tap the markets in 2022 compared with a year earlier, but recent market volatility may cause delays to IPO timings, Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said on an analyst call. 
""And in our index business, we expect index asset values to experience some impact associated with various market levels and investor appetite for products tracking our indexes,"" she said of the market volatility.
But Nasdaq may also benefit from higher futures trading volumes due to the use of its core indexes and market hedging strategies, she said. 
Stripping out one-time items, Nasdaq earned $1.93 per share, topping analysts' mean estimate by 15 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The trans-Atlantic exchange operator has also repositioned itself as a financial technology company, targeting the software sector with analytics, data and cloud services.
Revenue at Nasdaq's solutions segment surged 19% to $581 million, with its analytics products, which help customers make investment decisions across multiple asset classes, becoming key growth drivers. 
Nasdaq also launched a cloud-based data management platform geared toward investment management firms during the quarter.

Net revenue rose 12% to $885 million from a year ago. 
Like other financial institutions, inflationary pressures weighed on Nasdaq, with operating expenses rising 15%, mainly on higher employee compensation.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) was up 4% Wednesday as a Piper Sandler analyst found that sales of the company’s McPlant burger at McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) are doing better than expected.
The world’s biggest fast-food chain began testing the plant-based burger created with Beyond Meat in eight restaurants in November. A wider-scale experiment is scheduled to begin Feb. 14.
According to reports, analyst Michael Lavery feels the boost to Beyond’s revenue from McPlant sales could be as high as $215 million annually.
In a note to clients Tuesday, Lavery said test locations are selling about three-times more of McPlant burger than he initially estimated.
However, while Lavery continues to be bearish on Beyond Meat, he said a national rollout of McPlant by McDonald’s could be a near-term catalyst for the stock.
Beyond Meat share price is down more than 61% in the past year as the company has struggled to bring its products to market. Consumers have not adapted to faux meat at the pace that some expected them to, in part due to high prices."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -After a brief scare,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) reassured tech investors late on Tuesday that the enterprise internet cloud business category has plenty of room to grow.

But they rebounded https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSL4N2U548J on Wednesday on Microsoft forecast for cloud growth in the current quarter. Shares climbed more than 5% to $303.14, adding a boost to Wall Street's main indexes.
Executives forecast revenue for Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit of $18.75 billion to $19 billion for the third quarter, compared with a Wall Street consensus of $18.15 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
""We believe this can start to change the sentiment tide in tech,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. Microsoft's guidance was ""solid and robust and hopefully it will ease Wall Street concerns on tech earning power,"" he added.
The numbers for the quarter ended in December played on tech investors' fears that growth in the cloud business - among the strongest in tech industry segments - was decelerating.
Microsoft's forward-looking confidence, on top of its revenue for the second quarter beating estimates, helped battle back a backlash against tech shares that has led to stock price gyrations.
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said cloud acceleration and commercial bookings highlighted by Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood all helped ""save the Nasdaq.""
Accelerating constant currency growth for Azure - Microsoft's flagship cloud offering - coupled with strong demand will likely be reflected in upcoming financial reports from Microsoft rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Thill added.

""I very much think investors should feel confident, and you saw that in the rebound in the stock after management commentary and then guidance,"" said analyst Mark Moerdler of Bernstein.

The milestone coincided with the release of the iPhone 13, and amid otherwise stagnant demand for handsets as chief rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] market share declined.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s smartphone market share reached 23%, a record for the brand. Its unit sales volume grew 32% year-on-year in the quarter, while total smartphone sales in China fell 9%, according to Counterpoint. 
Counterpoint analyst Mengmeng Zhang cited a lower starting price in China and the impact of U.S. sanctions against Huawei, Apple's main competitor in the high-end segment, as factors.
Apple last ranked as China's top-selling smartphone brand in late 2015, just after the company launched its iPhone 6, which attracted Chinese consumers with their large screens.
In 2021 as a whole, Apple ranked as China's third best-selling smartphone brand with 16% of the market.
Vivo and Oppo, two Android handset brands under the privately-owned BBK Electronics, ranked first and second with 22% and 21% respectively.
Year on year, Apple's unit sales rose 47% while Huawei's tumbled 68%. Overall smartphone sales in China fell 2%, according to Counterpoint. 

Lengthening upgrade cycles have presented an ongoing dilemma for Chinese smartphone brands looking to maintain growth at home, as consumers delay purchasing new devices.
A global chip and component shortage has meanwhile rattled the entire electronics industry, affecting pricing and margins for all hardware makers.

Investing.com – AT&T stock (NYSE:T) rose 0.5% on Wednesday on strong fourth-quarter growth in its postpaid phone business.
The company signed up 884,000 net new postpaid phone subscribers in the quarter, more than 10% higher from a year ago as more customers embrace 5G services to enhance their video experiences. Mobility revenue was up 5% and topped $21 billion.
AT&T has prioritized its fiber internet business as an area for growth, and said it added 271,000 net new customers during the quarter. This was slightly short of the 273,000 subscribers it added in the business in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Growth in the phone and internet business is crucial for AT&T as the company completes the sale of its media business to Discovery. That business contributed $10 billion to the quarterly revenue as ‘Dune’, ‘The Matrix’ and the newest season of ‘Succession’ drew in more subscribers to its premium TV channel HBO and its streaming platform HBO Max.
AT&T expects the WarnerMedia-Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) deal to close in the second quarter.
The two platforms together added 4.4 million subscribers during the quarter, closing December at 73.8 million. AT&T had 60.6 million subscribers at the end of December 2020.
Including WarnerMedia and Xandr -- an advertising marketplace that it is selling to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- AT&T now expects 2022 revenue growth in the low-single-digit percentage range. The company expects annual adjusted earnings of $3.10 to $3.15 per share in 2022.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 09:30AM ET</span>",Intel scores major win as court scraps $1.2 billion EU antitrust fine,"By Foo Yun Chee
(Reuters) - Intel on Wednesday won its fight against a 1.06-billion-euro ($1.2 billion) EU antitrust fine that the U.S. chipmaker was handed 12 years ago for stifling a rival, in a major setback for EU antitrust regulators.
The judgment by Europe's second-top court in support of Intel's arguments is likely to cheer Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google in its fight against hefty EU antitrust fines and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which are in the EU antitrust enforcer's crosshairs.
The European Commission penalised Intel in 2009 for trying to block rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) by giving rebates to computer makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel.
The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, criticised the EU competition enforcer's analysis and annulled the fine.
""The (European) Commission's analysis is incomplete and does not make it possible to establish to the requisite legal standard that the rebates at issue were capable of having, or likely to have, anticompetitive effects,"" judges said.
The court annulled the entire article of the contested decision which imposed a fine of 1.06 billion euros on Intel for the infringement. 
The Commission said it would study the judgment and reflect on the possible next steps.
The same court had in 2014 upheld the Commission's 2009 decision but was subsequently told by the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest, in 2017 to reexamine Intel's appeal.
Regulators generally do not like rebates, especially those offered by dominant companies, on concerns they may be anti-competitive. Companies, however, say regulators must prove rebates have anti-competitive effects before sanctioning them.
The ruling will complicate the regulator's task, said Assimakis Komninos, a partner at law firm White & Case.
""This is a huge victory for Intel. It sets the bar higher for the Commission in bringing dominance cases. It will have to do an effects-based analysis for each case. This will have an impact on all companies,"" he said.
The ruling can be appealed to the CJEU.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Neil Young has threatened to pull his music from the Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) streaming service in protest of its relationship with podcaster Joe Rogan, who the prolific singer-songwriter accuses of spreading misinformation about COVID-19, according to media reports on Tuesday.
Young, who survived polio as a child, briefly posted a letter on his website addressed to his manager and his record label, Warner Music Group, demanding that Spotify no longer carry his music. The letter was later deleted.
“I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform. ... They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,"" Young wrote in the letter, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines - potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” the newspaper quoted Young, 76, as writing.
Rogan, 54, is the host of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" the top-rated podcast on Spotify, which has exclusive rights to the program.
As of Tuesday, Young's music, including such songs as “Heart Of Gold,” “Rocking In The Free World” and “Old Man,"" was still available on the service, as was Rogan's podcast. 
Spotify, Warner Music Group and ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Young could not be reached.
Rogan, who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has long stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic, government mandates and vaccines to control the spread of the coronavirus. He has questioned the need for COVID-19 vaccines on his show and said he used ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug that has no proven benefit against COVID. 
In the letter, Young singled out one episode in which a Rogan guest was pushing debunked anti vaccination theories, the Journal reported.
Young's letter noted that Rogan's podcast draws 11 million listeners each episode and highlighted that Spotify lacks a misinformation policy, the newspaper said.

Spotify began carrying Rogan's podcast in September as part of its efforts to transform itself into the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of audio. Rogan maintains full creative control over the show.
Earlier this month, 270 scientists and medical professionals signed an open letter to Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing him of spreading falsehoods on the podcast.

Investing.com -- Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) was 2% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as traders focused on its first quarterly positive cash flow since the first quarter of 2019.
Operating cash flow in the December quarter was $716 million as it generated robust commercial orders, including record freighter sales and took steps aimed at generating higher liquidity.
The company closed the year with an order backlog of $377 billion, higher by $10 billion in the three months through December as clients prepared for return to travel after two years of the pandemic.
Problems with its wide-body 787 Dreamliner planes continued to weigh on the company’s profitability. Boeing booked $3.5 billion in pre-tax non-cash charge as it intensified its efforts to return the planes to service.
Reuters reported last week that deliveries of the 787 are expected to remain frozen until around April as U.S. regulators review production flaws, while designs for the larger 777X face further regulatory pushback from Europe.
On the other catalog of planes – 737 MAX -- that too had its share of defect issues plaguing it, Boeing said it is currently producing at a rate of 26 per month and is progressing towards 31 per month in early 2022.
Boeing said since the FAA's approval in November 2020, it has returned the planes to service in nearly all global markets barring China where the country’s regulator issued an airworthiness directive last month, outlining changes required for their airlines to prepare their fleet for service.
Boeing’s fourth-quarter revenue fell 3% and came in short of $15 billion, let down by 14% erosion in defense, space and security revenue.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities are due a rebound after Wednesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, several indicators based on market levels and positioning are signalling.
Share markets have taken a beating as investors have ramped up bets that an era of ultra-low interest rates and vast pools of liquidity that boosted risk assets is fading quickly. The Fed is expected to signal later in the day that it will embark on policy tightening with rate hikes and balance sheet cutbacks.
Global stocks have lost 7% so far in 2022, with the Nasdaq Composite set for its worst start to the year since 1980 as high-flying technology shares fall out of favour.
But many reckon markets may have found a temporary bottom.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told clients the falls did not indicate a ""danger zone"" had been reached and that its risk indicator models suggest markets are nearing levels that are considered good entry points for longer-term investors.
Citibank too advised investors to consider buying into market dips. Based on a series of 18 metrics it said the number of ""red flags"" on U.S. markets was far lower than before the 2008 crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble.
Below are some more indicators signalling conditions for a bounce:
1/OVERSOLD TERRITORY
Chartists have been watching the relative strength index (RSI) to gauge oversold conditions for U.S. indices after this month's ructions. A level below 30 is traditionally seen as indicating a selloff has gone too far and pointing to a short-term bounce. 
All three major U.S. benchmarks are trading below that level, and the Nasdaq 100 - which has shed $3 trillion in market value this year - fell all the way to the lowest since December 2018 at 25.4. 
""U.S. markets are now looking oversold. I sense a rally,"" one UK-based trader said. 
Nasdaq 100 RSI https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmpjojgolvr/Nasdaq%20100%20RSI.PNG 
2/EXTREME BEARISHNESS
The latest sentiment survey by American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed retail investors in an extremely bearish mood; considered a classic contrarian signal, the indicator is hovering near its lowest in almost three years. 
AAII https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnwrgapq/AAII.JPG 
3/TAKING PROFITS FROM SHORTS
Net short positioning across U.S. benchmarks also points to a near-term bounce, potentially triggered by investors locking in profits from successful bearish bets. 
While the S&P has switched from net long to net short, Nasdaq positioning remains net short and according to Citi, the most ""negatively extended"".
Recent selling was more sentiment-driven than linked to new macro data, the bank said, adding that Nasdaq futures positioning was a ""one-sided short with profit levels rapidly rising which could lead to a short-term rebound.""
Overall, the futures flows picture implied ""weak conviction,"" they added.

US weekly flows https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpezngzlvr/US%20futures%20weekly%20flows.PNG 
4/FRENZIED PUTS 

The frenzied rush for the exits is also visible in the options markets. The CBOE put-to-call ratio has hit its highest since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, signalling investors may be getting too pessimistic in the short term. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy.

1697,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 08:45AM ET</span>",Tesla Needs a Big Beat to Get Back to $1 Trillion Value,"(Bloomberg) -- Pole position in the electric-vehicle business and a high valuation means Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) needs to deliver a blowout quarter to reclaim its trillion-dollar market value.
Tesla’s estimate-beating production and delivery stats have helped boost its projected revenue growth to 46% in 2022, a far cry compared to 20% for General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) and 15% for  Ford Motor Co . (NYSE:F). The problem is, even after the stock slumped 25% from its November record, Tesla’s dizzying market capitalization of $922 billion is more than 10 times the size of those 100-plus year old Detroit giants.
For Lindsey Bell, chief markets & money strategist at Ally Invest Securities, Tesla’s size only makes it more susceptible to violent market gyrations amid an environment of rising interest rates. 
The broader meltdown in high-growth stocks, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on monetary policy, adds to the headache for Tesla, which trades at 94 times forward earnings -- among the 10 most expensive members of the S&P 500 Index. What’s more, the specter of aggressive competition could hurt its pricing power as GM, Ford and new entrants such as  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) roll out more electric vehicles.
“If 2022 ends up being a year of more cautiousness toward some of the historical star performers, it is difficult to see why Tesla won’t get caught up in that,” David Jones, chief market strategist at Capital.com, said in an interview. 
Even strong fourth-quarter numbers could go only so far in soothing investors’ nervousness about the stock, given its whopping 27,000% run since Tesla went public in 2010.
Wall Street analysts, in aggregate, see the stock going nowhere over the next year: The average price target tracked by Bloomberg is $953, an increase of 4% from Tuesday’s close.
For Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, who has a $1,400 target, the focus on Wednesday’s earnings will be around commentary on deliveries in 2022, the shortage of semiconductors, when production will begin at new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, and the company’s growth and profitability outlook for this year and beyond.
“We believe the emerging fundamental story at Tesla will be back in focus of the Street with currently demand outstripping supply for Musk & Co. by roughly 30% globally based on our estimates,” he wrote in a note.
Tech Chart of the Day
After Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). has now wiped out almost all of its pandemic gains, leaving shares at almost half the record high in November after its poor outlook last week. Shares of the pandemic-era trading favorites have gotten caught up in a widespread rotation out of growth stocks, as concerns over inflation and Federal Reserve tightening have made investors less tolerant of high-valuation names.

According to Lipper data, financial sector ETFs have seen net inflows of $6.3 billion between Jan. 1 and Jan. 24, more than any other sector. 
""When interest rates rise, as will happen in 2022, banks' earnings will increase dramatically due to the higher interest rates, which creates a great spread between the interest they make lending and what they pay in interest,"" said Daniel Milan, managing partner at Cornerstone Financial Services, based in Michigan. 
""This is why the financial sector ETFs are having the highest inflows, as they should be one of the best performing sectors due to the increasing rate environment."" 
Analysts also expect investment banking and trading revenues of the banking sector to be stronger this year, despite higher interest rates.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the second-biggest provider of worldwide M&A advisory after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), expects some normalisation in investment banking revenue this year, but added that the overall deals pipeline remained healthy.
The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund led with inflows worth $1.9 billion this year, while Invesco KBW Bank ETF and SPDR S&P Regional Banking (NYSE:KRE) ETF received over $500 million each.
Investors are broadly cutting their exposure to growth stocks they accumulated over the past two years after the Federal Reserve flagged aggressive plans to begin raising rates and remove monetary stimulus.
Growth sectors, including tech and internet firms, are more vulnerable to a rise in interest rates, as their future cash flows get diminished. 
The MSCI World Growth index, which captures large and mid-cap stocks with higher forward earnings growth rates across 23 countries, has declined over 11.5% this year. 
On the other hand, the MSCI World Value index, which captures cheaper stocks based on valuation ratios, fell just 2.4%.

According to Refinitiv data, financial sector stocks look cheaper in terms of the forward price-earnings ratios (P/E), which enhances their appeal. 
The data shows large and mid-cap companies in the financial sector are trading at a forward 12-month P/E of 10.1, compared with the tech sector's 18.2.
