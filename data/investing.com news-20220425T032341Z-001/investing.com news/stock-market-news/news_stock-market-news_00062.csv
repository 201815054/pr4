Most of the cancellations are short-haul services, but 58 long-haul flights have also been scrapped, Lufthansa said. 

Verdi, which is asking for a 6 percent pay rise for around 2.3 million employees in various public sector roles across Germany, earlier said ground staff and some fire services staff would be on strike on Tuesday at Frankfurt, Munich, Cologne and Bremen airports.

Hilton announced the issue on Monday in a statement that also raised its first-quarter profit forecast.
HNA held a 26 percent stake, or about 82.5 million shares, in Hilton as of April 5. Its parent, HNA Group Co Ltd, said last week it would sell some or all of the $6.3 billion stake in Hilton.
Hilton, which also owns the Waldorf Astoria brand, said it now expects first quarter adjusted earnings per share in a range of 52-54 cents per share, up from 43-47 cent per share previously.
Hilton also raised its quarterly forecast for revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key performance metric for the hotel industry, to 3.5 to 4 percent, from 1 to 3 percent.
The company said underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 9.4 million shares of its common stock from HNA.
Hilton has agreed to repurchase from HNA 10 million shares of its common stock at a price equal to the one at which the underwriters will purchase shares from HNA, less 1 percent of the public offering price per share. 
Hilton will have the option to repurchase from HNA up to an additional 6.5 million shares of its common stock at the same price.

The company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering, Hilton said.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>","Russia's ruble, Rusal, Sberbank take hits as U.S. sanctions bite","By Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's ruble suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years on Monday and stocks in major Russian companies also slid, as investors reacted to a new round of U.S. sanctions targeting some of Russia's biggest tycoons. 
The sanctions, announced on Friday, target officials and business people around President Vladimir Putin in an aggressive response to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
The impact of the new measures could threaten Russia's fragile economic recovery, which was only just beginning to take hold after a wave of sanctions against Russia introduced in response to its annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Russia's currency briefly dipped more than 4 percent before recovering slightly to trade at 60.31 to the dollar at 1512 GMT, down 3.67 percent, its biggest daily percentage fall since January 2015. 
Shares in Russia's two biggest banks, Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB (MM:VTBR) fell 17.3 and 9.1 percent respectively. State-owned Sberbank is traditionally seen as a barometer for the wider health of the Russian economy.
On equities markets, Russian aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska saw the share price of one of his companies halve after he joined six other so-called ""oligarchs"" sanctioned together with their businesses, as well as 17 political figures. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was down 11.2 percent and the ruble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) fell by 7.7 percent - to their lowest levels since September and November respectively.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was watching events on the markets closely but that an assessment of the impact of the sanctions would take time. 
""The situation is pretty egregious from the point of view of legality, it tramples on all kinds of norms, and so a thorough analysis is necessary,"" Peskov said.
ALL EYES ON ALUMINUM
United Company Rusal Plc (HK:0486), at the heart of Deripaska's global aluminum empire, saw the price of its shares listed in Hong Kong fall over 50 percent. 
Rusal said in a statement that the impact of sanctions could trigger technical defaults on some of its debts. Its dollar-denominated bonds fell hard on default fears, while its Moscow-listed shares (MM:RUAL) tumbled 27.7 percent.
""Rusal will probably have to be bailed out by Russian state banks,"" analysts at TS Lombard wrote, adding that Deripaska may also be forced to sell his stake in Norilsk Nickel (MM:GMKN), losing a drawn-out battle with Vladimir Potanin for control of the metals giant.
Three private jets that are linked to Deripaska's family, according to Russian media reports, have returned to Moscow in the past few days, flight tracking services showed. 
TROUBLE AT HOME 
The sanctions mean Russian companies face the prospect of losing access to the U.S. market, which accounted for around 14 percent of Rusal's revenue last year, according to analysts at Promsvyazbank.
But Russian firms could also run into trouble in other markets as investment partners pull out to reduce exposure. 
The Swiss engineering company Sulzer (S:SUN) decided to buy back 5 million of its own shares from Renova Group at an emergency board meeting on Sunday, to reduce Renova's holding to below 49 percent. Viktor Vekselberg, Renova's Russian chairman, was included on the sanctions list on Friday.
Though Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) was not sanctioned, Alexei Miller, its chief executive, was included on the U.S. list. That could create complicated legal dilemmas for Gazprom's many foreign partner companies. 
Most are under EU jurisdiction, but they will not want to fall foul of U.S. legislation either.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Monday ordered his government to prepare measures to support sanctioned Russian entities and to draw up possible retaliatory steps.
However, Russia may find it difficult to respond in kind by imposing sanctions on U.S. businesses since few of them have significant Russian exposure. 
Russian companies not under sanctions are also taking a hit. Steel miner  Evraz  (L:EVRE) was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Monday, down 8 percent, while gold producer Polyus saw its 2023 dollar bond issue plumbing a record low.
Russia's sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve, with its September 2043 eurobond  falling to a five-day low.

The cost of insuring exposure to Russian debt also rose on Monday to its highest since mid-December, IHS Markit data showed.

Sales for the Spark slumped 36 percent to 22,589 units in the United States last year. 
The production plan for the new crossover is dependent on support from the South Korean government and concessions for its local union, a GM Korea spokesman said. The new model is tapped for production in 2022.
General Motors had said in February it plans to shut down one of its factories in South Korea, and was rethinking the operational viability of three other plants in the country. 
The move also comes as sales of GM's Opel brand in Europe might put a dent on the demand for Spark, which is being exported to Europe as Opel's Karl. 
Opel earlier said it will shift production from South Korea to Europe and import nearly 200,000 less vehicles per year from South Korea by 2020.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>","China rails at theme park boom over debt risk, 'blind' construction","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's powerful state planner said on Monday that a boom in theme parks around the country had led to ""blind"" construction and was creating local debt risks, underscoring Beijing's concerns over property development bubbles.
Theme park developers should strengthen supervision to ""prevent the formation of local debt risks, social risks and financial risks,"" the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement on its website.
""In the development of theme parks we've seen unclear concepts, blind construction, imitations and plagiarism, low-standard duplication and other issues,"" the NDRC said, adding in some areas ""local debt risks"" were emerging.
The regulator also said firms should look to bolster the role of government in theme park planning and strictly control large-scale theme parks, defined as those over a certain size and involving investment over 1.5 billion yuan ($237.71 million).
China has seen hundreds of theme parks spring up around the country to tap into fast-rising consumer demand, with developments from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), Dalian Wanda Group,  Sunac  China Holdings Ltd (HK:1918) and others.
China's theme park market saw sales grow 27 percent last year to hit an estimated 39.5 billion yuan, according to consultancy Mintel. It is set to more than double in size to 89.2 billion yuan by 2022.
The NDRC added property developments around theme parks, including residential and commercial buildings, would be more strictly controlled and must be separately approved rather than being ""bundled in"" with the park development itself.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Viacom asks CBS to raise its bid by $2.8 billion: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) has asked CBS Corp (N:CBS) to sweeten its merger bid by about $2.8 billion or almost a quarter more than CBS's offer, people familiar with the matter said, indicating the wide gap in the U.S. media firms' price expectations.
National Amusements Inc, the Redstone family company that controls CBS and Viacom, has pushed them to negotiate a merger by forming independent board committees. Viacom's request shows how the companies have yet to make progress in their talks.
In a letter to CBS last week, Viacom asked for 0.68 CBS shares for each Viacom class B share, the sources said. CBS had offered 0.55 of its shares for each Viacom class B share, sources have said.
CBS is now considering its next steps in the deal negotiations, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because Viacom's request is confidential. 
CBS and Viacom declined to comment.
Shares of CBS were trading around $52.67 on Monday morning, while Viacom shares were trading around $30.75. 
At CBS's proposed share exchange ratio of 0.55, Viacom would be valued at $11.9 billion, below its current market capitalization of $12.7 billion. Viacom's counterproposal values the company at $14.7 billion.
Viacom shares have risen by about a third since early November on speculation of new efforts to merge CBS with Viacom, after the previous round of negotiations in 2016 ended unsuccessfully.
In its letter to CBS last week, Viacom also asked for its Chief Executive Robert Bakish to be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, a demand supported by National Amusements, according to the sources. 
CBS has asked for its chief operating officer, Joseph Ianniello, to have that role instead, the sources said. 
Both CBS and Viacom agree that CBS CEO Les Moonves should lead the combined company, according to the sources.
The merger would combine CBS' television network, local TV stations and Showtime cable network with Viacom's cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, as well as its Paramount Pictures film studio.
The pressure on the media sector to consolidate has increased following AT&T Inc's (N:T) planned $85.4 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) and Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) recent deal to buy some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) assets for $52.4 billion.
Combined, CBS and Viacom would have more leverage to negotiate prices for their programing with U.S. cable and satellite companies, which face a decline in subscribers amid fierce competition from media streaming companies like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).
CBS investors may be worried that the work to combine the two companies could slow CBS' growth trajectory, said John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies.

The Financial Conduct Authority has said financial firms should feel comfortable about relying on a transition deal agreed last month between Britain and the EU.
EU officials, however, say this was a political deal and won't be legally ratified until later in the year, meaning firms should continue implementing plans based on a ""hard"" Brexit next March.
""We should not hold up the work, in my view,"" FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey told reporters.
He said UK and EU regulators could start coordinating now so that a system of regulatory coordination is in place, ready to be introduced once transition has been legally ratified.

The plans would include ensuring continuity in cross-border derivatives and insurance contracts.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",China a favorite for investors even as trade war risks grow,"By Vidya Ranganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's currency, bonds and stocks are among fund managers' top picks for 2018 as they bet the United States and China will avert a full-blown and potentially costly trade war.
Unlike in 2017, when a 'Goldilocks' scenario of synchronized global growth and low inflation led to a broad-based rally across Asian markets, this year has brought early challenges for investors. Chief among those are the threat of faster rate rises by the Federal Reserve, a reversal in the U.S. dollar's steady downtrend and the risk of a full-blown trade war.
The trade situation remains tense after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened China with another $100 billion of tariffs but also predicted Beijing will make concessions. China has warned that it is prepared for a ""fierce counter strike"".. 
Asian stock markets have been volatile since February as the United States imposed broad tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and renegotiated a trade deal with South Korea.
""We don’t think trade tensions are going to escalate to a full blown trade war,"" said Daniel Morris, a London-based senior investment strategist with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. ""We think there may be bouts of volatility, but the actual path is at the minimum status quo, if not conceivably an improvement in trade in the long run.""
Morris said his fund is still overweight on equities in general and views the return of volatility to markets as an opportunity to pick up good assets cheaply. 
Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, has also increased allocation to Chinese equities on the view they are still cheap and that the trade dispute will be resolved. 
Chinese equities make up the biggest proportion, at nearly 25 percent, of the $1.1 billion Asian Growth strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.
Fund managers argue that the steel and aluminum on which the U.S. has announced tariffs are a tiny proportion of China's exports. The China-specific tariffs also exclude many consumer electronics, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones. 
Besides, the Chinese companies currently part of MSCI's Asia-ex-Japan index (MIAPJ0000PUS), such as Tencent Holdings,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and technology firm Baidu, do not compete merely on costs and so tariffs wouldn't blunt the demand for their cutting-edge technology products
NOT EXPENSIVE 
Andrew Gillan, head of equities at Janus Henderson, says an escalation in tit-for-tat tariffs would be negative for global growth. ""But these risks are not unique to Asian companies, they are very much a risk for global companies that are accessing Asia for their growth opportunities.""
Both China and South Korea have been big recipients of foreign money in 2017 and so far this year, as have equity markets in India and Taiwan.
The Shanghai benchmark index (SSEC) rose 6.5 percent in 2017 but is down nearly 5 percent so far this year. It is still cheap, trading at a price-earnings ratios of 13.9, which is far lower than that for markets in India, the Philippines and even the United States.
Meanwhile, the sanguine view on the trade war is fuelling expectation that the U.S. dollar will resume its 3-year downtrend, giving Asian central banks room to hold off on rate rises as the region's currencies appreciate. 
In addition, the relative stability of China's yuan, the promise of its bonds being included into global benchmark indices and hints of a slowing economy have lured investors. Bloomberg said last month its Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Index will include Chinese yuan-denominated government bonds from next year.
The largest position in the $5.7 billion fixed income fund Western Asset Management's Desmond Soon manages is in yuan bonds. 
Aberdeen Standard Investments' fixed income manager Mark Baker is also overweight on Chinese bonds. 
""China had its big selloff back in 2016-2017, so domestic yields have already repriced significantly higher,"" Baker said.

""And it looks to us the economy is beginning to slow again now from the heights of last year and that should be a more constructive environment for rates.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose in early deals on Monday as hopes that a full blown trade war between the United States and China could be averted spread across markets.
The pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX) had risen 0.5 percent by 0805 GMT, after closing in the red Friday when investors feared the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economy could turn for the worse. 
""The chatter over the weekend appeared to suggest some optimism that some form of deal would likely be the probable outcome, though how long that could take to pan out remains a significant unknown, and as such further volatility seems likely"", said CMC Markets' Michael Hewson.
The situation in Syria, after President Donald Trump warned of a ""big price to pay"" for dozens of people killed by poison gas in a rebel-held town, was not impacting confidence.
The fact that U.S. futures were pointing to Wall Street opening in positive territory was supporting European bourses, analysts said. 
Financial stocks contributed the most to the rise with  Deutsche Bank  (DBKGn.DE) up 3.2 percent after it named a new CEO who said tough decisions would have to be made and the structure of its investment bank reviewed.
Another top mover was Portuguese energy and utility group EDP (LS:EDP), up 5.3 percent after a report French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) was examining a possible bid. 
Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR) rose 1.9 percent after it agreed to sell its Germany-based diesel parts maker L'Orange to U.S.-based engineering company  Woodward  Inc (O:WWD) for 700 million euros ($859 million), as part of a plan to simplify its business. 
Still on the front of mergers and acquisitions,  Novartis  (S:NOVN) rose 0.5 percent after announcing a $8.7 billion deal for AveXis (O:AVXS), a move into gene therapy that gives the Swiss drugmaker a rare-disease treatment seen reaping billions in sales and bolsters its technology base.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) retreated 0.5 percent after proxy adviser Glass Lewis recommended investors back a proposal by activist fund Elliott to replace six board members and shake up the way top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) runs the phone group.
Fresh U.S. sanctions on Russia had a strong impact on a number of corporations linked to allies of President Vladimir Putin. 
En+ Group, which manages the assets of tycoon Oleg Deripaska, was down over 20 percent and said the sanctions were ""highly likely"" to materially affect its business and prospects in an adverse way.

Shares in Swiss pump maker's shares Sulzer (S:SUN) and Swiss technology group Oerlikon (S:OERL) were sharply down, falling 8.5 percent and 5.4 percent respectively after their majority holder Viktor Vekselberg appeared on a list of U.S.-sanctioned individuals.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 03:20AM ET</span>",Accounting watchdog to bite harder with 10 million pound fines,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's Big Four accounting firms will face potential fines of 10 million pounds ($14 million) or more for serious rule breaches from June, double the record penalty to date.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said on Monday that it has accepted the findings of a study in November by former judge Christopher Clarke, which recommended much bigger fines for serious misdeeds by the world's biggest accountants.
Larger fines are part of the FRC's push to bolster its credibility after being heavily criticized by lawmakers for being too slow to take on the big accountants caught up in company scandals.
Under the FRC's disciplinary procedure, it sets out a case against an auditor or individual accountant at an independent tribunal before asking the tribunal to set a fine at a specific level. The record amount agreed by a tribunal so far is 5.1 million pounds for PwC over its audit of RSM Tenon.
Clarke recommended an increase in fines to 10 million pounds or more for seriously poor audit work from a Big Four accounting firm, meaning PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte, who check the books of most international blue-chip companies.
The FRC also accepted other recommendations from Clarke to make greater use of non-financial penalties and to exclude dishonest auditors from the accounting profession for at least 10 years.
However, fines will be discounted in line with the level of cooperation during an investigation to encourage early settlement, the FRC said.
A 10 million pound fine is still small compared with penalties imposed by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority for breaches of financial rules.
Britain's ICAEW accounting industry body has already warned that exacting retribution through big fines could harm the marketplace by prompting some firms to quit auditing.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 05:17AM ET</span>",China joins HK-U.S. battle for Chinese tech listings,"By Samuel Shen and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchange, last year announced plans to help the next wave of Chinese tech giants go public in the city, bankers celebrated. 
At last, they felt, Hong Kong could compete against New York, its fiercest rival for initial public offerings, by starting to offer tech founders the weighted voting rights common in the United States they were demanding. 
But in the past month a new rival has gatecrashed Hong Kong's hoped-for IPO party: China itself. 
On March 30, China's securities regulator announced its own pilot scheme to encourage the very same group of companies to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Beijing is also targeting the likes of Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, and JD.com by allowing them to list at home via secondary listings - business that has also been high on Hong Kong's agenda. 
At the heart of the three-way tussle lies an estimated $500 billion worth of Chinese tech firms expected to seek listings in the coming years - representing the biggest potential pool of IPO fees in the world outside the US tech sector.
For China, the hope is to see more of its tech companies list at home, where domestic investors can benefit from any success.
""China is encouraging innovation, but if all successful innovative companies rush overseas for listings, it would be embarrassing,"" said Ronald Shuang, chairman of Balloch Group, a China-focused investment bank and private equity firm.
Last week the Baidu-backed iQiyi became the latest group to list in New York, raising $2.25 billion in the biggest international Chinese tech listing since Alibaba.
Both Xiaomi, the smartphone and appliances maker, and Meituan-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand online services, are planning to float in Hong Kong this year, with Xiaomi seeking a valuation of up to $100 billion. 
As Beijing steps up its efforts to attract Chinese tech companies, Hong Kong - which is expected to implement the weighted voting rights in the second quarter, reversing a long-standing one-share-one-vote principle - is playing down the competition.
""There is no doubt that many firms will actively consider listing in the mainland, but we expect a strong pipeline of firms interested in Hong Kong as well,"" Li, the head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, told a panel of the city's Legislative Council members on April 3.
He added: ""Competition is always a factor, but the mainland and Hong Kong capital markets have some fundamental differences that do not make us direct competitors.""
How far China will crash Hong Kong's planned tech party depends, say bankers, on how it implements its rules for Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) - which would allow investors in China to buy securities of companies already listed overseas.
CDRs are expected to trade in yuan, potentially creating an arbitrage opportunity with the dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts or Hong Kong dollar-denominated shares they will be based on. Beijing is still in discussion with regulators, bourses and bankers on the issue.
Different trading mechanisms also present other issues. China has a 10 percent daily trading limit, up or down, on mainland stocks, which most expect would apply to CDRs. 
""If Alibaba rises or falls more than 10 percent in the US in an extreme situation, but in China, existing rules cap its move,"" said Wu Beihong, an investor who buys stocks in both China and overseas. ""How do you solve this issue?"" 
Another question is how much tech champions would be expected to list at home, and how those shares would be sold. 
If China's biggest four internet groups - Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com - were to sell 5 percent of their existing shares in the mainland, that would drain $55 billion from the market, equivalent to a fifth of all the funds raised in the onshore market in 2017, according to UBS analysts.
That could hit the pipeline of mainland IPO candidates hard - or prompt a sell-off in smaller shares if investors wanted to raise cash for the returning giants.
The sales might also prove difficult to execute. Last month, Naspers, the one-third owner of Tencent, sold a 2 percent stake in the tech giant, raising $9.8 billion in Asia's largest-ever block sale and dwarfing any single sale in the mainland.
""Do Shanghai or Shenzhen have the expertise to sell $10 billion in Tencent or Alibaba?"" asked one Hong Kong official who requested anonymity. ""That is a big ask.""
The irony of potentially selling and trading shares in China based on offshore listings of Chinese companies domiciled outside the mainland - which they have to be to list overseas - is not lost on investors and bankers.
They are however already well versed in a universe of Chinese securities that includes several distinct onshore and offshore groups, including H-shares, A-shares, B-shares, red-chips and US ADRs among them, which already often trade at different valuations. 

""Prices of the same company are different in Hong and China, and that's because regulations and rules in the two markets are different, and that difference may persist for a long time,"" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""So investors need risk-management when trading - and to understand the logic behind the price gaps.""

Sewing, 47, was appointed late on Sunday after a crisis meeting to discuss how to end three years of losses. He replaces Briton John Cryan who failed to meet cost targets, and his elevation could signal a retreat from decades of investment banking expansion.
Sewing, who has been with Deutsche Bank since 1989, said Deutsche would pull back from areas where it was not sufficiently profitable.
He said he would analyze how Deutsche Bank wants to position its investment bank in a difficult market environment but left open what structural measures he could take.
Analysts and investors swiftly demanded clarity over where growth would come from.
""What matters, and in our view Deutsche Bank has been missing for several years now, is a clearly defined strategy,"" JP Morgan analyst Kian Abouhossein said on Monday. 
""Deutsche Bank's problem is not the CEO, as speculated by the press, but different stakeholders with different interests, with little evidence of commitment to changing the organization in the interests of the owners: shareholders and creditors."" 
The bank's largest investors are Qatar's royal family, Chinese conglomerate HNA, U.S. asset manager BlackRock and private equity fund Cerberus. Together they own about a third of Germany's largest bank, which employs more than 97,000 people.
The prospect of deeper cost cuts sent shares in Deutsche Bank 2.9 percent higher in early trading, topping the STOXX Europe 600 banks index at 0817 GMT (4.17 a.m. ET) .
NO MORE SETBACKS
In a letter to employees on the bank's website, Sewing said that Deutsche needs to regain its ""hunger for business"" and set the bar for revenues higher in all businesses. 
""The priority is to leverage our strengths and to allocate our investments accordingly. And at the same time we will look to free up capacity for growth by pulling back from those areas where we are not sufficiently profitable,"" he said.
At the same time, its 2018 target for adjusted costs of no more than 23 billion euros ($28 billion) is non-negotiable, Sewing said.
""Setbacks like in the fourth quarter of 2017 are not to be repeated under any circumstances,"" he said.
In the last three months of 2017, Deutsche Bank's net loss had widened to 2.2 billion euros from 1.9 billion a year earlier as revenue slumped 19 percent, fanning shareholders' discontent with a lack of clear progress in turning the bank around.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut their price target on Deutsche Bank's stock to 13 euros from 15 euros amid uncertainty over the lender's future strategy and warned that it would be difficult to cut less profitable business without causing too significant a loss in shareholder value.
Cryan had been in charge since 2015 and his mandate would have expired in 2020, but investors had lost faith that he could return the bank to profitability.

His fate had appeared sealed two weeks ago when reports emerged that Chairman Paul Achleitner had begun searching for a successor.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) is moving further into gene therapy by buying AveXis (O:AVXS) for $8.7 billion, adding a rare-disease treatment that could reap billions in sales.
The acquisition reflects a surge of interest in biotech deal-making as large pharmaceutical companies seek promising new assets to boost their pipelines.
The $218-per-share cash deal announced on Monday represents a 72 percent premium to AveXis's 30-day volume-weighted average stock price. The transaction is seen closing in mid-2018.
Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who took over on Feb. 1, is flush with cash, having just agreed to sell his company's stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture to GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) for $13 billion.
Narasimhan is now counting on AveXis's main drug, AVXS-101 for deadly spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), as well as the Illinois-based company's gene therapy expertise and manufacturing capabilities, to bolster Novartis's neuroscience business, a focus for the Swiss company. 
This is Novartis's second notable gene therapy deal this year after it agreed to pay $105 million upfront and up to $65 million in milestone payments for rights to Spark's blindness treatment Luxturna outside the United States.
""We believe the medicine would have a multi-billion dollar peak sales potential,"" Narasimhan told reporters of AVXS-101, which has so-called breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and is expected to be submitted to regulators this year.
""It also provides us capabilities in gene therapy,"" he added. ""We have a robust internal portfolio of gene therapies in ophthalmology and neuroscience in Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research. And we look forward to using AveXis's capabilities and technical development capabilities to be able to advance that portfolio."" 
Novartis shares were up 0.8 percent at 0830 GMT.
The company said the acquisition would slightly dent core operating income in 2018 and 2019, due to research and development costs, before strongly contributing to profits in 2020 as sales accelerate.
Adding promising drugs from outside to boost sales growth down the road is a strategy being pursued by several of Novartis's rivals.
France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) agreed to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium's Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bagged cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion.
Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) is also considering a deal for London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP), which has a market value of about $47 billion.
""WHO'S NEXT?""
Novartis's second bet on gene therapy in four months will fuel speculation of mergers and acquisitions as large pharmaceuticals and biotech companies remain on the prowl for smaller targets, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.
""Clearly Novartis is building out in gene therapy,"" Yee said. ""Who's next?""
Narasimhan, who said the patient population for SMA was 23,500 people in established markets, plans to use proceeds from the GSK transaction to help pay for AveXis. 
SMA affects the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement, and commonly leads to death in young children. 
So far, a study of AVXS-101, which replaces a faulty gene, shows children achieved many important motor nerve milestones after getting treatment. Additional data is due for release this month, Narasimhan said.
There are existing treatments for SMA - Biogen's and Ionis's RNA-splicing Spinraza, approved in 2016, generated $363 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 - as well as therapies under development by Roche (S:ROG) and  Cytokinetics  (O:CYTK).
""Novartis is taking the view that AveXis's ... transgene approach trumps Biogen/Ionis' approved Spinraza and other agents in development,"" UBS analysts wrote.
Narasimhan said the transaction reflected Novartis's strategy of hunting for new medicines and technologies to buttress medicines it is developing in-house.
""Our goal is to continue to build on our core medicines,"" he said. ""With the exit of the GSK stake, our intention was to re-deploy capital into our core.""
AveXis is also developing gene therapy candidates in other rare diseases, Rett Syndrome and inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, that Novartis also sees as good prospects.

Novartis's financial adviser on the deal was Dyal Co LLC, while AveXis's was Goldman Sachs (N:GS).

Shares in Rusal, one of the world's largest aluminum producers, fell to HK$2.70 in late morning trade, its lowest since October 2016. That compared with 1.76 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng index (HSI).
""Investors were rushing to square their position or doing what they need to do with their exposure to the stock and to those shares which are sanction and trade war sensitive,"" said Steven Leung, a sales director at UOB Kay Hian.
Washington imposed sanctions on Friday on seven Russian oligarchs, including Rusal's former President Oleg Deripaska, 12 companies they own or control, as well as 17 senior Russian government officials. The Russian individuals and companies were targeted for profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world. 
Rusal's shares (MM:RUAL) dropped 16 percent on the Moscow Exchange on Friday. 
The company on Friday said that it regretted its inclusion on the new U.S. sanctions list, adding that its advisors were studying the situation.
""The company's initial assessment is that it is highly likely that the impact may be materially adverse to the business and prospects of the group,"" the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse on Monday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares crept higher on Monday as a rally in U.S. stock futures soothed sentiment even as U.S. President Donald Trump kept up his twitter war with China just a couple of days before President Xi Jinping gives a keynote speech.
Helping was news North Korea had told the United States for the first time that it was prepared to discuss denuclearization when their leaders meet.
There was more confusion than reaction to reports, which the Pentagon quickly denied, that U.S. forces had struck at sites in Syria. 
Trump said on Sunday there would be a ""big price to pay"" after medical aid groups reported dozens of people were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town.
For now, investors in Asia were encouraged that E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were still up 0.6 percent, while NASDAQ futures rose 0.8 percent.
European bourses looked set to open firmer with FTSE futures up half a percent and Germany 0.4 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan responded by rising 0.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei put on 0.5 percent and Hong Kong 1.1 percent.
Caution had been the watchword after Trump claimed on Sunday that China would take down its trade barriers because it was ""the right thing to do.""
Trump late Thursday threatened to slap $100 billion more in tariffs on Chinese imports, while Beijing said it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"".
Analysts warned the drama would be a long-running one given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals meant the earliest they might be imposed was somewhere around late July or early August.
""This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,"" said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global.
""Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end. But..you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.""
XI AND ZUCKERBERG
The next major hurdle will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday.
The tech sector faces its own risks on Tuesday and Wednesday when  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is grilled by Congress over a political consultancy's use of customer data.
Some hope the looming earnings season will be strong enough to provide fundamental support for stocks, with analysts tipping the fastest quarterly profit growth in seven years.
Bonds gave back some of their safety gains with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt nudging up to 2.797 percent, though that compared to a top of 2.8380 last week.
Japanese investors sold a record 3.924 trillion yen ($36.68 billion) of U.S. dollar bonds in February, as rising costs of currency-hedging undercut their yield attraction.
In currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 107.04, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49. 
The euro held at $1.2277, and above the recent trough of $1.2212, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 90.150.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will hold meetings with some U.S. lawmakers on Monday, a day before he is due to appear at Congressional hearings over a political consultancy's use of customer data, two congressional aides said on Sunday.
The planned meetings at Capitol Hill are expected to continue through Monday afternoon and include some lawmakers from committees before whom Zuckerberg is due to testify, said the aides, who asked not to be identified because the meetings have not been made public.
Facebook declined to comment.
Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear before a joint hearing of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Tuesday and the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.
Facebook has come under fire in recent weeks after it said that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
A Facebook spokesman said on Sunday that the company plans to begin telling affected users on Monday.
London-based Cambridge Analytica, which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign among its clients, has disputed Facebook's estimate of the number of affected users. 
Zuckerberg is expected in his testimony to recognize a need to take responsibility and acknowledge an initial failure to understand how many people were affected, a person briefed on the matter, who asked for anonymity, said on Sunday.
Zuckerberg said in a conference call with reporters last week that he accepted blame for the data leak, which has angered users, advertisers and lawmakers, while also saying he was still the right person to head the company he founded.
On Friday, Facebook backed proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads and introduced a new verification process for people buying ""issue"" ads.
The steps are designed to deter the kind of election meddling and online information warfare that U.S. authorities have accused Russia of pursuing, Zuckerberg said on Friday. Moscow has denied the allegations.
In February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies with interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by sowing discord on social media.

Zuckerberg, on the call with reporters, said Facebook should have done more to audit and oversee third-party app developers like the one hired by Cambridge Analytica in 2014.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 01:29AM ET</span>","As GM union faces big job losses, South Koreans turn cold shoulder","(This April 8 story has been refiled to say ""employs"", not ""employees"", in 13th paragraph; and add dropped word ""is"" in 10th paragraph)
By Hyunjoo Jin
BUPYEONG, South Korea (Reuters) - When Lee Bum-yeon lost his job along with nearly 2,000 other union workers in 2001 after South Korea's Daewoo Motor went bankrupt, his neighbors at supermarkets and bakeries gave his young daughters free snacks and bread.
""People felt sorry. People felt heart-broken. They were worried how we were going to make a living,"" 55-year-old Lee said.
Now, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) cutting some 2,600 jobs and threatening to leave South Korea in the absence of steep union concessions, the once sympathetic public is nowhere to be seen.
""I don't think anyone is feeling for us anymore,"" a grim-faced Lee, who was rehired by GM a year after it bought Daewoo in 2002, told Reuters outside GM's Bupyeong factory near Seoul. 
South Korea's reputation for militant unions and rigid labor practices has long been cited as contributing to high labor costs and a persistent discount for corporate Korea. Shares of South Korean companies are typically undervalued in comparison to their global peers, a phenomenon known as the ""Korea Discount"".
Now, like unions in other major auto producing countries, Korean labor leaders are under pressure to make concessions as automakers look to shift jobs and investment to countries with lower costs.
""I expect militant unions to become more reasonable, which would lead to enhanced labor flexibility,"" said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. ""Unions have learned a lesson from past incidents where they can lose all if they go militant.""
DEMOCRACY TO MILITANCY
Unions at large firms spearheaded South Korea's fight for wages and basic labor rights against powerful family-run conglomerates known as chaebol, during the country's rapid industrialization in the 1980s and 1990s.
They also led South Korea's democracy movement under then authoritarian governments, enjoying backing from non-unionized workers at small firms and the broader public.
But the power and influence of the unions has been weakening. Much of the public is now seeing them as an ""interest group which seeks to maximize their own interest"", said Kim Tai-gi, an economics professor at Dankook University in Seoul.
Images of auto workers with shaved heads and red head bands clashing with riot police have come to epitomize today's public perception of unions.
Union membership has halved in the last two decades to just 10 percent of workers in 2016, according to labor ministry data. That is the second-lowest after Turkey among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 
GM, which employs 16,000 South Korean workers, announced in February it would close its Gunsan plant and weigh options for its three other factories in the country. 
GM's union already said it will not seek a pay rise or bonuses this year, the first time it will forgo such demands during annual wage talks since GM acquired Daewoo. 
But GM warned its loss-making South Korean operations would file for bankruptcy unless the union agreed to further cost cuts by April 20.
Cha Min-song, a 29-year-old nurse from Suwon, south of Seoul, couldn't care less about the plight of the big auto unions. 
""They already earn way more than most South Koreans, but young people are struggling to find jobs, many of them are just temporary workers,"" Cha said. 
'OBSESSED' WITH OWN INTEREST
The 1987 democracy movement and the creation of unions at Hyundai Group and other large conglomerates led to widespread wage increases in the early 1990s.
But after massive layoffs following the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, workers at big companies became ""obsessed"" with their own job security, said Yoo Hyung-geun, a professor at Pusan National University.
Their fight for job security and more wages often came at the expense of young job seekers, and workers at smaller firms.
Workers at firms with 30 to 99 employees earned only 68 percent of what those at companies with more than 300 employees made last year, according to Reuters' analysis of labor ministry data. The corresponding figure was 78 percent in 1993. 
Meanwhile, youth unemployment in South Korea hit a record 9.8 percent in 2017, almost three times the national rate, and worse than Japan's 4 percent and 8.1 percent in the United States.
The government of President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer who defended union activists, is advocating for non-unionized temporary workers, while calling on unions to try to regain public support. 
""We feel very betrayed by the government and Moon,"" said a union official at Kumho Tire. ""Not just the president but many cabinet members were engaged in the labor movement in the past, but they are now saying no to us."" 
Kumho's labor union protested and threatened to strike when creditors agreed to sell the troubled company to China's Qingdao Doublestar last month. In the face of public and government pressure, the union eventually agreed to the deal.
""The public do not understand why highly paid regular workers are protesting and walking out, when temporary workers can't even strike because they are at risk of losing their jobs at any moment,"" the Kumho union official said.
Others acknowledge changes are needed at the unions.
About 50 GM union officials breached a security door to executive offices then damaged company property, GM Korea said in a memo to employees last week.
""We have to honestly admit that we have lost our way,"" said Lee, the GM worker.

41,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 06:02PM ET</span>",Bond Investors Get Access to $16 Billion of Extra Debt in India,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s central bank raised limits for overseas investors that could lure $16 billion of additional funds into the nation’s sovereign as well as corporate debt.
Foreign investors will be allowed to increase holdings of sovereign, state and corporate bonds by 1.04 trillion rupees ($16 billion) in the fiscal year to March 2019. Overseas investors can boost holding of central government securities by 0.5 percentage points a year, taking the limit to 5.5 percent in fiscal year to March 2019 and to 6 percent in the following 12 month period, the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement Friday. The central bank set 9 percent as the limit for foreign investors to own in debt sold by Indian companies.
In the past two weeks, the government has trimmed its fiscal first-half borrowing plans to reduce debt supply, and the central bank allowed lenders to spread out bond-trading losses to spur demand. The steps cooled bond yields, which had reached a two-year high to threaten the borrowing plans of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration. While traders have cheered the initiatives, a trade war brewing between the U.S. and China may fuel volatility and reduce demand for emerging market assets.
""Real return on India’s debt is relatively higher than other emerging market nations, and hence this limit increase will be quickly lapped up by foreigners,” said Dwijendra Srivastava, chief investment officer for debt at Sundaram Asset Management Co. “Demand for both government and corporate bonds from global investors is seen as robust,” except if the trade war between the world’s two largest economies intensifies, he said.
Indian sovereign bonds posted their biggest weekly gain since November 2016 after the central bank’s move to lower its inflation forecasts spurred optimism it won’t be raising interest rates anytime soon. The yield on sovereign bonds due January 2028 dipped to 7.18 percent on Friday from 7.40 percent the prior week. The rupee gained 0.3 percent last week against the dollar.
Government bonds had fallen for seven straight months to February, the deepest selloff in two decades as excessive debt supply, quickening inflation and higher global yields soured sentiment. State banks, the biggest holders of the securities, have swung to become net sellers this year as the rout saddled them with losses.
While Modi’s government had initially wanted to borrow a near-record 6.06 trillion rupees in the fiscal year that started April, it reduced the target by 500 billion rupees last month in an effort to calm the bond market. It was forced to cancel or cut back on debt sales earlier this year.
The central bank’s Friday announcement follows a 2015 review when policy makers said the cap will be raised to 5 percent of outstanding debt by March 2018, from an estimated 3.8 percent then.
Foreign investors bought 1.4 trillion rupees of bonds in 2017, the highest since 2014. While they still purchased 95.24 billion rupees in January, they became net sellers in the last two months.
The RBI also announced that the limit for foreign portfolio investment in state development loans would remain unchanged at 2 percent of outstanding securities. It will discontinue existing sub-categories in corporate bonds and there will now be a single limit for such debt."

Shares in the parent company of Google look inexpensive trading at 25 times projected 2018 earnings of about $42 a share, Barron's said. While that's a premium to the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which fetches around 16 times estimated 2018 earnings, Alphabet's growth stands apart given its large revenue base of $111 billion.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Saudi exchange counting on foreign funds to aid Aramco IPO, chief says","By Marwa Rashad
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's stock exchange expects an influx of foreign funds to smooth the listing of national oil firm Saudi Aramco, despite concern among some analysts about whether the market can absorb the huge offer, the exchange's chief executive said on Sunday.
""Foreign investors are putting in more money -- every day we have improved liquidity capacity,"" Khalid al-Hussan said in an interview.
The government has said it plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco, hoping to raise some $100 billion or more in what is likely to be the world's biggest initial public offer. Officials have said that in addition to Riyadh, Aramco may list on one or more foreign markets such as New York, London and Hong Kong.
Many private analysts think the $100 billion target is too ambitious, but even a $50 billion IPO could strain the Saudi market, which has a capitalization of about $500 billion -- especially if the burden is not shared with a foreign exchange.
Saudi Arabia's biggest IPO so far, the sale of a stake in National Commercial Bank (SE:1180) in 2014, raised just $6 billion. In January this year, an advisory council to the government asked the securities regulator to study whether the Aramco sale might destabilize the market.
Hussan insisted, however, that from technical and regulatory perspectives, the Saudi exchange was fully prepared to handle the Aramco IPO, alone if necessary.
He noted that foreign investors were not permitted to buy shares directly in the National Commercial Bank offer. Now, rules have been changed to permit foreigners to take part in local IPOs.
Hussan also said last month's decision by equity index compiler FTSE Russell to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status, and a similar decision which fund managers expect MSCI to make in June, would attract billions of dollars of fresh foreign money to the local market.
Regional investment bank EFG Hermes estimates Saudi Arabia could see fund inflows totaling $30 billion to $45 billion in the next two years if it reaches the foreign ownership levels of markets in neighboring United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 
Some foreign money has started to enter the Saudi market in anticipation of a positive impact from the FTSE and MSCI decisions. Foreign investors, including qualified foreign institutions (QFIs), have been buyers of stocks every week this year, purchasing a net $2.17 billion, exchange data shows.
""What we have seen at the beginning of this year from foreign investor participation and the cash inflows and the number of registered QFIs in the market, gives us a very comfortable state,"" Hussan said.
He did not comment on the timing of the Aramco IPO. Officials originally said it would take place by the end of 2018, but Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters last month that it could occur at the end of 2018 or in early 2019, depending on market conditions.
If Saudi officials are relying on foreign fund inflows to facilitate the Aramco IPO, they may be tempted to wait until early 2019. 
""Passive"" funds benchmarked to FTSE indexes will only enter Saudi Arabia when its upgrade takes effect, in stages between March 2019 and December that year. Similarly, if MSCI decides to upgrade Riyadh, the decision would probably only take effect in mid-2019. 

Passive funds may account for roughly a third to a half of foreign mutual funds entering Saudi Arabia in the next couple of years, fund managers estimate.

The CBI, a federal police body, is now also questioning some officials at overseas branches of Indian banks which issued loans to companies owned by the two jewelers against bank guarantees - later shown to have been fraudulently issued by certain rogue employees at PNB.
The case, dubbed India's largest ever bank fraud, has led to a huge probe and 20 arrests have been made so far in relation to the matter.
The court in Mumbai approved the CBI's application to issue non-bailable warrants against jewelers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi in the PNB fraud, said the agency source, who asked not to be identified.
Modi and Choksi have denied the allegations against them and authorities say they both left the country before the fraud was uncovered in February. PNB has said it is working with the investigators and regulators probing the fraud case.
The CBI is also questioning officers of overseas branches of Indian banks that extended credit facilities on the basis of the fraudulent letters of undertaking (LOUs), issued by employees of PNB, the source said.
The agency has also summoned an officer dealing with foreign exchange at Allahabad Bank's (NS:ALBK) Hong Kong branch, for questioning, the source said.  Allahabad Bank  has previously denied any wrongdoing.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 06:13AM ET</span>",Proxy adviser Glass Lewis tells Telecom Italia investors to back Elliott's proposals,"MILAN (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) investors back a proposal by activist fund Elliott to replace six board members and shake up the way top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) runs the phone group, a document showed.
Elliott, which wants to improve governance and performance at Telecom Italia (TIM), has built a potential holding of 5.7 percent in the company. Last month, it called for six Vivendi-nominated board members, including TIM Chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, to be replaced through a vote on April 24.
""Elliott's proposals provide the opportunity to functionally evict those directors clearly serving Vivendi's interests and replace them with new, independent candidates bringing experience and expertise plainly germane to Telecom Italia's operational scope and strategy,"" the influential proxy adviser said in a report for shareholders seen by Reuters.
TIM declined to comment, while Vivendi could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Since first becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has increasingly tightened its grip on TIM. It now owns 24 percent. 
Vivendi eventually appointed two-thirds of TIM's board and named its own chief executive as TIM executive chairman, raising concerns among other shareholders and politicians in Rome who consider the company of strategic national importance.
The stakes in the fight for leadership at TIM were upped last week after Italian state lender CDP said it would buy up to 5 percent in the group to safeguard Rome's interest.
Even if Elliott's board candidates are backed, no clear indication of who will end up calling the shots at Italy's biggest telecoms group is likely to emerge for several weeks.
Following Elliott's move last month, eight board members nominated by Vivendi resigned, triggering a full board renewal at a separate shareholder meeting called for May 4.
Elliott believes there will be no need for TIM shareholders to choose a new board in May if its candidates are elected in April. Meanwhile TIM says even if Elliott's candidates are elected on April 24, a new board would be voted in May.
Shareholders have until Monday to present their slates. 
For the April meeting, Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders vote in favor of Amos Genish serving as chief executive for the next two years. Genish was co-opted by the board last September following the resignation of his predecessor, but his appointment has to be approved by shareholders to continue beyond the April AGM. 
Most institutional investors approve of Genish, despite him being an ally of Vivendi Chairman Vincent Bollore, because of his track record as a telecoms veteran and dealmaker in Brazil.
Genish already features on the slate put forward by Vivendi.
This may prove a conundrum for some shareholders who may want to weaken Vivendi's grip, but will not want to lose Genish, whose three-year business plan presented last month was welcomed by investors. 

At the same time, the Israel-born CEO is unlikely to remain at TIM if it ends up with a board that would not give him the majority backing necessary to push through with his business plan, sources close to the matter have said.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank picks insider Christian Sewing as new CEO: sources,"By Andreas Framke and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Christian Sewing, currently co-deputy chief executive officer of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), is to become the new CEO of Germany's biggest lender, replacing John Cryan, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Sewing, a German national, would replace Cryan, a Briton, at a time when the bank is trying to strengthen its brand in its home market. Cryan has been in office less than three years but investors have lost faith that he can return the bank to profitability after three consecutive years of losses.
The promotion of Sewing, 47, with a background in retail banking, auditing and risk, comes as Deutsche Bank and its major shareholders debate the path forward for the investment banking unit where revenues have slowed and key staff defected.
His appointment could signal a shift in emphasis away from Deutsche Bank's strategy of seeking profit growth through the investment bank and giving investment bankers greater influence.
Marcus Schenck, currently Sewing's fellow co-deputy CEO who also helps oversee the investment bank, is close to leaving the bank, the people familiar with the matter said.
Sewing tops a list of candidates as the preferred option to be presented by Chairman Paul Achleitner at a hastily arranged board call for Sunday evening, the people familiar with the matter said. A second external candidate is also being proposed though that person's chances for the top spot are slim, the second person said.
Sewing would assume the helm at the company's annual general meeting in May, German magazine Der Spiegel said on its website. Der Spiegel was first to report on Sunday that Sewing would likely become the bank's next CEO.
Deutsche Bank said late on Saturday that the board would discuss the CEO position and make a decision.
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Sunday.
BLOW TO SCHENCK
In picking up the baton, Sewing would also face challenges including further cost cutting, intense competition at home and abroad, and increased regulation.
Sewing, a member of the management board since 2015, currently oversees the bank's private and commercial bank division, which includes the Postbank retail banking unit.
He joined Deutsche Bank in 1989 and has worked in Frankfurt, London, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto, according to the bank's website.
""Our view is that Sewing seems to be an OK candidate,"" said a major investor who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Sewing's appointment would be a blow to Schenck, a former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) investment banker long considered a future CEO at Deutsche.
Schenck had signaled he was looking for opportunities outside the bank. Garth Ritchie would stay on as sole head of the investment bank, said the first person familiar with the matter. There is still internal debate on the outcome, said the second person.
Achleitner had begun a search last month to replace Cryan following a flurry of negative headlines after the bank reported a third consecutive annual loss.
Cryan has said he is ""absolutely committed"" to the bank. But Achleitner has remained silent, to the disappointment of major investors seeking clarity. Sunday's board call is intended to provide that clarity.
""DYSFUNCTIONAL COMPANY""
The leadership debate also parallels concern about the direction of Deutsche's investment bank, whose swift expansion in the years leading up to the financial crisis is blamed for many of the bank's current woes.
The investment bank's revenue in 2017 was down 25 percent compared with 2015, a steeper fall than those suffered by its rivals. The division employed more than 41,000 staff at the end of 2017, up 4 percent from 2015, but key staff have left.
The bank is conducting a global review of the investment bank, known internally as Project Colombo, a person with direct knowledge of the matter has said.
Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas said Sewing's appointment would mean more focus on commercial and retail banking and wealth management.
""It looks like the board of directors is capitulating on the investment banking front,"" Marenzi said.
Cryan, the son of a jazz musician, married into the wealthy Du Pont family of the United States. He took charge at Deutsche in 2015 to overhaul the bank after years of rapid growth under investment bankers.
But his tumultuous tenure as CEO highlights many of the bank's underlying issues.
Early on, Cryan quickly announced thousands of job cuts to trim costs but reversed the bank's plans to sell its Postbank retail business after tepid interest from buyers.
Some of Germany's most senior politicians criticized Cryan for paying 2.3 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in staff bonuses, four times higher than the previous year, after the bank had made losses in 2017.
The bank's chief operating officer Kim Hammonds, told a colleagues recently that the bank was ""the most dysfunctional company"" she had ever worked for, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Over the past weeks, a number of names have surfaced as possible replacements for Cryan. But some analysts wonder whether anyone will be able to do a better job on turning the bank around.
""There has been actually a disciplined execution in a tough environment by this team,"" said Peter Nerby, who analyses the bank for Moody's. ""I wonder if anyone really has a better way to get there. It's not obvious to me what that way would be.""

Agrokor, the biggest employer in the Balkans, was put under state-run administration last April and has until July to reach a final deal with creditors..
The company said last month it expected to have debt settlement terms ready by April 10, and creditors would vote on the deal before July 10, the legal deadline for avoiding bankruptcy. Two thirds of the creditors must support the deal to make it valid. 
""A draft has been agreed among creditors and should be formally accepted next week... Sberbank will own some 30 percent or a bit more, while with another Russian bank, VTB (MM:VTBR), the percentage controlled by banks from Russia will amount to close to 45 percent,"" the Vecernji List daily said.
Agrokor was not immediately available for comment.
The largest private company in the Balkans with some 60,000 staff, Agrokor was put under administration for 15 months in April 2017 after the firm buckled following a rapid expansion program that left it weighed down by borrowing.
Sberbank is Agrokor's single biggest creditor with a claim of 1.1 billion euros ($1.35 billion). VTB's claim amounts to 300 million euros.
The overall claims against Agrokor, from creditors including also local banks, bondholders and suppliers, amount to some 58 billion kuna ($9.59 billion), the company says.
Vecernji List said the bondholders, of which the biggest is the U.S. investment fund Knighthead, would get up to 25 percent of Agrokor, while the local banks would get up to 10 percent.
The value of Agrokor's assets has been assessed at between 1.8 and 3.8 billion euros.
The suppliers would also get a portion of Agrokor's shares. A considerable part of debt to suppliers has already been repaid.
The restructuring process with creditors aims to put Agrokorback on a sustainable debt and equity footing, which includes certain write-offs.

The move puts another hurdle in the transaction, following an order by Singapore's competition watchdog that Uber delay its shutdown by a week because of an ongoing review.
""Uber's compliance with our anti-trust counterpart in Singapore to extend the operation of its app indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,"" Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement.
The Philippine business of Uber was supposed to shut down on April 8.
The anti-trust body also tasked Uber and Grab to maintain the independence of their business operations, including ride hailing and delivery platforms, and customer and rider database.
Uber declined to comment while Grab did not immediately comment. Uber and Grab announced the deal late last month, marking the U.S. company's second retreat from an Asian market.
""This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,"" said PCC, which started its review on Tuesday.
The Philippine transportation agency caps the number of ride-sharing vehicles at 65,000 across all brands and reviews the figure every three months.
Uber previously sold operations in China and Russia to local rivals under former CEO Travis Kalanick. In Europe, the company has faced protests, court battles and bans after some local authorities and taxi drivers said it did not abide by the same rules on insurance, licensing and safety.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) supervisory board intends to ""take a decision"" on Sunday after discussing John Cryan's job at the helm of the bank, the German lender said late on Saturday.
In a brief statement, the bank confirmed earlier reports that Chairman Paul Achleitner had invited the supervisory board to an ""update call"". Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that a replacement for Cryan could be discussed at the meeting.
""Deutsche Bank's Supervisory Board will have a discussion on the bank's CEO position on Sunday evening,"" the bank said. ""It is planned to take a decision in this context on the same day."" 
A representative for the bank was not immediately available to elaborate, but the two sources said earlier on Saturday that they could not rule out the possibility of a major announcement.
An external candidate to succeed Cryan was more likely than an internal candidate, one of the sources said.
Achleitner will act quickly to resolve the situation, said a third person who is a major investor in the bank, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Sunday discussion by the board follows two weeks of turmoil over the bank's leadership.
Achleitner had initiated a search to replace Cryan, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on March 27, following a flurry of negative headlines after the bank reported a third consecutive annual loss.
Cryan, who has been in office less than three years, responded by writing a memo to staff in which he said he remained ""absolutely committed"" to the bank. But Achleitner stayed silent, to the chagrin of major investors seeking clarity.
In recent days, Achleitner has broken his silence and reached out to some major investors, according to two other people with knowledge of the matter.
Achleitner was criticized by two major investors this week over the bank's performance and his handling of the search for a new chief executive.
The leadership debate underscores the continued fragility of the 148-year-old bank after speculation of a possible government bailout just over a year ago.
INVESTMENT BANK WOES

Facebook is under intense pressure after the data of millions of its users ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, has said that it worked with Canadian company AggregateIQ.
""In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,"" Facebook said in a statement. 
""Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities."" 
Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) is a government and military contractor that is the parent of Cambridge Analytica.
Wylie has said that AggregateIQ received payment from a pro-Brexit campaign group before the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to quit the European Union. 
The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Thursday that the agency, along with its counterpart in British Columbia, would jointly investigate Facebook and AggregateIQ over the ongoing data scandal. 
British Columbia's privacy commissioner was separately investigating AggregateIQ over whether the Victoria-based company had broken provincial personal privacy rules for its role in the Brexit campaign.
Facebook Canada said on Wednesday that more than 600,000 Canadians had their data ""improperly shared"" with Cambridge Analytica.
AggregateIQ was not immediately available for a comment. 
Cambridge Analytica tweeted on Wednesday, ""When Facebook contacted us to let us know the data had been improperly obtained, we immediately deleted the raw data from our file server, and began the process of searching for and removing any of its derivatives in our system.""
Facebook said on Wednesday that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million.
Facebook first acknowledged last month that personal information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.

London-based Cambridge Analytica, which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign among its clients, said on Wednesday on Twitter that it had received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended investors vote against a stock plan for employees at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), concerned about its costs and the bank's heavy use of stock-based compensation.
In a report to clients sent by an ISS spokesman, the leading proxy advisor wrote that the ""the cost of the company's equity plan and three-year burn rate are excessive.""
""Burn rate"" measures the proportion of outstanding stock used to pay everyone from Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein to rank-and-file workers, and roughly tracks how fast investors are being diluted.
Goldman previously acknowledged its burn rate has been higher than rivals as it overhauls its strategy. Based on shareholder feedback, the New York bank had proposed to continue its equity plan for three years but request no new shares for issuance under the plan. 
ISS also said it would offer just ""cautionary"" support in an advisory vote for the pay of top executives including Blankfein, who received about $22 million in 2017. 
While investors will welcome a shift to more equity awards tied to performance, ISS wrote, Goldman's compensation committee has much discretion in setting pay and goals for executives may not be so rigorous. 

Goldman Sachs representatives did not immediately comment.

Maduro targeted Copa along with other Panamanian companies, Varela himself and other government officials one week after Panama put Maduro and some 50 Venezuelan nationals on a list of those considered ""high risk"" for money laundering and financing terrorism. In announcing its action on Thursday, Venezuela said those on its list pose a risk to its financial systems.
Both countries have withdrawn their ambassadors, escalating tensions between the countries. 
On Friday, Varela said Venezuelans would be the real victims of the move on Copa.
""Panama is a logistic route,"" he told reporters. ""Venezuelans rely on Panama to supply medicine and food that they lack.""
Recently, various international airlines have abandoned Venezuela, citing insecurity and currency issues, which make it hard for them to repatriate profits. Copa was one of the few that continued operating flights, and its temporary suspension further isolates the country.
Venezuela is experiencing a severe crisis amid an economic recession, hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine that have left millions seeking to abandon the country. 

""We don't want to enter into a diplomatic fight,"" Varela said. ""We hope that reason prevails, but Panama will keep taking the steps previously announced in the coming days and weeks.""

59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 08:49PM ET</span>",China trade dispute could slam U.S. retailers,"By Nandita Bose and Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration's trade dispute with Beijing could slam U.S. retailers if tariffs are implemented and lead to higher prices or a shortage of merchandise. 
President Donald Trump late on Thursday said he was considering penalties on $100 billion in Chinese goods, without specifying which goods he would target. That would be in addition to the proposed tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China that Washington unveiled last week. Trump's first round of $50 billion in tariffs mostly targeted industrial goods and electronic components. 
The threatened U.S. tariffs could be little more than a negotiating tactic aimed at forcing China to address its intellectual property policies. But some retailers and apparel companies are sounding the alarm bells. 
The two biggest categories of U.S. imports from China last year were communications and computer equipment, totaling $137 billion according to U.S. Census data. Cellphones and computers, key portions of these categories, were spared from the initial tariffs list. Apparel and footwear, both labor-intensive industries in China, made up a combined $39 billion in U.S. imports.
""It's this rhetoric around another $100 billion in tariffs that concerns us because certainly within that next pool of categories it would be hard to exclude apparel and footwear,” said Robert D’Loren, chief executive of Xcel Brands Inc, a clothing supplier to Macy’s Inc, Hudson’s Bay Co and others. 
""If tariffs were to be introduced on apparel, the very next day I will be on a plane to China and I will be working with my factories, trim suppliers, mills to have each of us assess how much tighter we can work to deal with this,” he said.
Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation's vice president for supply chain and customs policy, also expressed concern over what the new set of tariffs might entail. 
""Our concern is that the new set of tariffs will turn to more consumer products not on the list and will now include things like apparel, home goods, shoes, all of those basic retail goods coming in from China,” Gold said.
""As companies make their buying decisions especially for the holiday season, which they do six, nine to 12 months in advance they are trying to figure out how they will do this going forward.”
Should a trade war ensue, retailers with vast global supply chains may suffer less than others.  Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s Companies Inc, for example, have the ability to acquire products in multiple markets and could move to tap alternative markets such as Vietnam, Bangladesh or Colombia for merchandise.
""Many retailers will do just fine, but you have to have other markets where your products can go,” said Brandon Fletcher, an analyst at broker-dealer Sanford C. Bernstein.
""Let’s say you pre-committed six months ago to buying a whole bunch of TVs from China. Now, the tariffs might force that to be a 25 percent higher price. And so you say, ‘OK, I don’t want to sell these in the U.S. because I have to pay the tariff.’ Well, is there a tariff for China on selling televisions to Mexico? Nope.""
Walmart has reduced its supply chain exposure to China “quite a bit” over the years as lower cost goods became available out of Vietnam, while Costco has sourcing offices in a number of core markets beyond China, Fletcher noted. In contrast,  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) depends heavily on China to source smaller TV sets and other low-priced merchandise, and there are no easy alternative supply countries, he said.
Best Buy declined to comment on how the tariffs might impact the company's supply chain.
At  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG), a substantial amount of imported merchandise comes from China, according to a company filing dated March 23. A spokesman for Dollar General declined comment. 
At  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), China is its single largest source of merchandise. It said in its annual report, the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products could adversely affect its business. ""Like all companies, we are monitoring the situation very closely,"" a Target spokeswoman said.
As the cost to make goods in China has gone up over the past decade, many retail and apparel companies have moved some production to Vietnam, Bangladesh and Indonesia. For instance, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) purchased 28 percent of its apparel in China in fiscal 2013, according to Christopher Svezia, a senior vice president of research at investment services company Wedbush. By fiscal 2017, the apparel chain bought 22 percent of its merchandise in China and 25 percent in Vietnam, he said. ""There’s definitely been some movement out of China across the board,” Svezia said.
Gap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""You can’t just say let’s go to Pakistan or North Africa. It’s not so easy,"" said Xcel Brands' D’Loren. ""It will take years to build out the supply chain. Even if you have the capital you won’t be able to find the factories,"" he said. ""Production lines are booked months or years in advance.”

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's national oil company Saudi Aramco on Saturday is expected to disclose initial steps toward a multibillion-dollar chemical plant in Texas, according to sources familiar with the company's U.S. operations.
Saudi Aramco has been weighing an expansion of its U.S. subsidiary Motiva Enterprises LLC's [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas refinery, already the largest in the United States by capacity. 
But Motiva wants to first move into petrochemicals, using abundant natural gas from U.S. shale fields to make the precursors for plastics, the sources said.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott is expected to attend an event in Houston on Saturday where Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser are to discuss the plans, according to a Saudi Aramco representative.
""Motiva is actively exploring a number of opportunities as part of its growth strategy,"" the company said on Friday. ""These opportunities include locations where we currently operate as well as new ones.""
Saudi Aramco last year said it would invest $18 billion in Motiva's Port Arthur refinery, which can process up to 603,000 barrels of crude oil per day (bpd).
Motiva wants to add an ethane cracker near its refinery that could produce more than 1.5 million tons of ethylene a year, the sources said. 
Saturday's announcement will also include an agreement with TechnipFMC (N:FTI) for a study of producing materials used in gasoline and industrial solvents, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Motiva Chief Executive Brian Coffman last month said the company had yet to win approval for its major expansion projects.
Other U.S. companies, including  Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co [CHEPH.UL] - a joint venture of Chevron Corp (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) - and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), have recently have opened plants to process ethane into ethylene. Chevron Phillips is considering building a second ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast of Texas. 
The price tag for a large ethane cracker is typically over $6 billion, according to Steve Lewandowski, vice president of Global Olefins at researcher IHS Markit. 
""Ethane crackers make a lot of hydrogen which refiners can use in hydrocrackers and hydrotreaters"" to make motor fuels, Lewandowski said.
Exxon is separately proposing to build with another Aramco unit, Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010), a $9 billion petrochemical plant near Corpus Christi, that would process ethane.
Refiners see petrochemicals as a new market as demand for motor fuels is expected to plateau later in the century, said Sandeep Sayal, vice president, downstream energy research at IHS Markit.

""Refinery industry growth is fairly subdued,"" Sayal added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has won a closely watched contest to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines (O:AAL), beating European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) for the highly coveted order of widebody, long-haul aircraft.
""This was a difficult decision between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 and A330neo and we thank both manufacturers for their aggressive efforts to earn more of American's business. In the end, our goal to simplify our fleet made the 787 a more compelling choice,"" American Airlines President Robert Isom said in a statement.
The deal, at a list price of more than $12 billion, is the latest in a series of blows to the Airbus A330neo. It comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines [HAII.UL] dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favor of the 787, leaving that variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers. 
""This new order is a powerful endorsement of the 787 family's unique passenger appeal and unmatched ability to help airlines open new routes and grow profitably,"" Boeing Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement.
Reuters had previously reported that Boeing was primed to emerge triumphant in the hard-fought widebody contest, bringing along in its victory engine maker  General Electric  (N:GE), whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft.
As part of the deal, American and Boeing have reached an agreement to defer the delivery of 40 737 narrowbody jets previously scheduled to arrive between 2020 and 2022 to ""better align with planned retirements of other narrowbody aircraft.""

Parsons' nomination comes as Shari Redstone, who with her father Sumner Redstone controls both CBS and Viacom, pushes to recombine the media giants after failing in an attempt to do so in 2016. Shari Redstone had been gathering names of possible candidates for CBS's board, as the company plans on replacing several of its directors at its annual shareholder meeting in May, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal in January. In March, CBS made a verbal offer for Viacom valuing it at below its market value of around $12.5 billion, sources told Reuters. On Wednesday, however, sources told Reuters that Viacom was preparing a counterproposal to CBS's first share exchange offer, which it deemed inadequate.

(Reuters) - That little tab on the rear pocket of your Levi's jeans is now the subject of a lawsuit.
Levi Strauss & Co on Friday sued the French luxury house Kenzo, accusing the unit of LVMH (PA:LVMH) of trademark infringement for putting tabs on its pants pockets, including in a new clothing line featuring singer Britney Spears.
The complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where Levi is based, said Kenzo's activities threaten to cause Levi to lose sales and suffer ""incalculable and irreparable damage"" to its goodwill, and confuse shoppers.
Kenzo did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours. A lawyer for the Paris-based company could not immediately be located.
Levi said it has put distinctive tabs bearing its name, in the form of folded cloth ribbons, in the seams of its pants pockets since 1936, to provide ""sight identification"" for its products.
It said Kenzo has not complied with its cease-and-desist letters to stop selling its own clothing bearing similar tabs, including in its ""Kenzo presents Britney Spears-La Collection Memento No. 2"" line launched last month.
The complaint quoted Leo Christopher Lucier, Levi's national sales manager in 1936, as having said ""no other maker of overalls can have any other purpose in putting a colored tab on an outside patch pocket, unless for the express and sole purpose of copying our mark, and confusing the customer.""
Levi is seeking to recoup lost profits, compensatory and punitive damages, and halt further infringements.

66,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>","Powell, Williams See More Gradual Fed Hikes Despite Trade Uproar","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell backed further gradual interest-rate increases amid strong U.S. economic momentum, in remarks that avoided the turbulent U.S. stock market and sought to steer clear of the simmering U.S.-China trade dispute.
“We will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a sustained economic expansion with a strong labor market,” Powell said Friday in his first speech since becoming chairman in February. “As long as the economy continues broadly on its current path, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.”
U.S. stocks extended losses after his remarks, with the S&P 500 Index ending 2.2 percent lower Friday as investors took note of Powell’s reluctance to be swayed from raising rates. His remarks were reinforced by comments several hours later by incoming New York Fed chief John Williams.
“I guarantee you they are thinking about it,” Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC said. “It is hard to think that any more bad news on tariffs doesn’t reduce the odds of faster tightening down the road.”
Powell’s prepared comments, which included no reference to China or financial markets, hewed closely to his March 21 press conference that emphasized the stronger U.S. economic outlook after the Fed raised interest rates and signaled at least two more moves in 2018.
Asked subsequently about the tariff debate, he said it’s “really too early” to estimate how tariffs will impact the U.S. economy. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was weighing tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports, bringing to $150 billion the range of Chinese goods under consideration. China says it will respond proportionately.
Williams, who is currently head of the Fed’s San Francisco branch, backed projections for three or four rate hikes this year and called his outlook “very positive” with “low and falling unemployment, and inflation that is closing in on our 2 percent long-run goal.”
“The economy continues to steam ahead,” Williams told an audience in Santa Rosa, California. “I am confident that we can carry on the process of gradually moving interest rates up over the next two years while seeing solid growth and historically low rates of unemployment.” He takes the helm of the New York Fed on June 18. The new job makes him vice chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Asked about trade, Williams said “so far, the kind of things that have been happening about specific actions -- they don’t add up to a huge effect on the economy.”
Laura Rosner, a senior economist at Macropolicy Perspectives, said the inflation and growth affects from tariffs right now have a “small impact” on her forecast. “We are saying it is small and the Fed is saying it is too early” to say anything about the impact, Rosner said.
The S&P 500 Index is down almost 10 percent from its January peak. Still, policy makers forecast solid growth this year aided by Republican tax cuts, and job growth remains steady.
Powell said reports from the labor market were mixed, with some indicators showing tightness and others showing slack.
“The absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not excessively tight,” Powell said. “I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.”
Employers added 103,000 new workers in March, Labor Department data earlier on Friday showed, while unemployment held at 4.1 percent. Inflation, measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge, rose 1.8 percent in the 12 months through February and has been below the Fed’s 2 percent target for most of the last six years.
“Given that the current pace of growth is above trend, my view is that we need to continue on the path of raising interest rates,” Williams said.

68,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 05:02PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this past week
1. Trade War Fears Wreak Havoc on US Equities
Wild swings in U.S. stock markets were a common theme through the week swayed by investor uncertainty on the prospect of full blown U.S.-China trade war, while a lacklustre jobs report did little to improve sentiment.
U.S. President Donald Trump upped the ante on the trade war front after instructing his administration to consider an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing as expected said it would fight back “resolutely” to protect its interest should the U.S. continue to adopt its protectionism stance.
The latest exchange of salvos on trade Friday between the two nations came just a day after the Dow Jones had notched a three-day winning streak on expectations that neither the U.S. nor China were pining for a trade war. 
The wobble in the labor market, meanwhile, also pressured equities after the U.S. economy created  103,000 jobs in March, according to a report released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. That missed economists’ forecast for 193,000.
There was a spot of bullishness in the market, however, as  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) made its public-listing debut, closing at $147.92 Friday, about 12% above its reference price of $132.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) also garnered investor support after the carmaker beat Wall Street projections for Model 3 deliveries.
The Dow fell 572 points Friday, to close at 23,932.76.
2. Crude Oil Prices Fall For Second Straight Week
Crude oil prices slumped to a second-straight weekly loss as a larger than expected draw in crude stockpiles mid-week was mostly overshadowed by escalating trade-war fears, dampening demand for riskier assets.
While a jump in U.S. oil rig counts to 808, the highest level since March 27, 2015, added to fears over rising U.S. output. U.S. production rose to a record 10.46 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration Wednesday.
""We expect U.S. oil production to increase by 0.2-0.3 million bpd per quarter during 2018,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note clients earlier this week.
On Friday U.S. crude futures fell 2.3% to settle at $62.06 a barrel.
3. Dollar Posts Weekly Win Against Yen Despite Trade-War Jitters
The dollar closed roughly unchanged on the week as investors opted against initiating large bets on the greenback following a mixed jobs report and an ongoing China-U.S. trade spat.
The greenback posted a weekly gain against safe-have yen, despite falling 0.47% to Y106.88 Friday.
Yet, some view a potential trade war between the world’s largest two economies as a short-term positive for the dollar. A trade war would likely reduce competition, raise prices, boosting inflation.
“We remain focused on the constructive technical backdrop for the dollar and war of words on the global trade front, both of which have us leaning short-term positive on the dollar,” TD Securities said.
The dollar fell 0.37% to 89.79 against a basket of currencies on Friday.
4. Flight to Safety Helps Gold Notch Weekly Win 
Gold prices bounced back from last week’s slump to post a weekly gain on Friday as escalating trade-war fears triggered safe-haven demand.
Dollar weakness, meanwhile, also supported upside momentum in the precious metal as the greenback struggled to find its footing amid a mixed jobs report released Friday.
Some market participants said the ongoing slump in equity markets could trigger a rotation back into the precious metal, pushing it as high as $1,450.
“When, rather than if, equities correct, we will still be faced with depressed yields,” Metals Focus director Nikos Kavalis said earlier this week. “At this point, investor rotation back into gold, even on a modest scale, should help take it to around $1,450 by year-end.”
5. A Swing and a Miss: Bye-Bye $7,000 Bitcoin?
Bitcoin remained on track to test its Feb. 6 low of $6,000 after its rebound earlier this week came under heavy pressure as regulatory concerns resurfaced.
India took measures this week to curb cryptocurrency activity, pressuring the already fragile sentiment on cryptocurrencies. The Reserve Bank of India ordered regulated entities to unwind their positions with individuals or business dealing in cryptocurrencies.
The Spanish Treasury, meanwhile, launched an investigation to crackdown on tax evading and money laundering crypto investors.
The regulator contacted 16 banks, around a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges and companies operating cryptocurrency ATMs and more than 40 businesses that accept online cryptocurrency payments, according to a report from Coindesk, citing a source at the country's tax agency.
While many remained fearful of entering crypto space, famed investor George Soros was said to be eyeing an entry into the market. 
Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade virtual coins in the last few months, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Yet, it would likely take a lot more than the $36 billion Soros family office fund to stop the current crypto rout amid scant demand for cryptos.
The total market cap of cryptocurrencies fell to about $250 billion – at the time of writing – from just under $300 billion last week, pointing to a lack of investor appetite for cryptos.
Bitcoin fell 2.47% to $6,592, on the Bitfinex exchange, while Ethereum fell to $368.79, down 2.31%. Ripple XRP fell to $0.46657, down 3.02% on the Poloniex exchange."

70,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 05:06PM ET</span>",Trump administration mulls stiffer rules for imported cars,"By David Shepardson and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering ways to require imported automobiles to meet stricter environmental standards in order to protect U.S. carmakers, according to two sources familiar with the administration's thinking.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump ""will promote free, fair and reciprocal trade practices to grow the U.S. economy and continue to (bring) jobs and manufacturers back to the U.S.” 
Two U.S. automotive executives said Friday they believed the idea had been floated in White House talks last week by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, but said the auto industry had not asked for the changes or backed them. 
A Commerce Department spokesman referred a Reuters request for comment back to the White House, which has not responded. 
U.S. automakers have long urged removal of non-tariff barriers in Japan, South Korea and other markets that they believe unfairly hinder U.S. exports. There are also concerns that any new non-tariff U.S. barriers could violate WTO rules.
The story was first reported Friday by the Wall Street Journal.
Citing unnamed senior administration and industry officials, the Journal said Trump had asked several agencies to pursue plans to use existing laws to subject foreign-made cars to stiff emission standards.
It appears such non-tariff barriers could have a greater potential effect proportionately on European automakers, which collectively import a greater percentage of cars from plants outside the United States, according to sales figures from Autodata.
In comparison, Japanese and Korean brands made about 70 percent of the vehicles they sold last year in the United States at North American plants. European brands built only 30 percent in North America.
Foreign automakers operate 17 assembly plants in the United States, 12 of which are owned by Asian manufacturers. Virtually all of those are non-union plants, many of them in southern states.
Imported vehicles accounted for about 21 percent of the 17.2 million sold last year in the United States, according to Autodata.
The White House initiative was still in the planning stage, with officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency working to craft a legal justification for the policy, the paper said.

The EPA and the Commerce Department, which the newspaper said was also involved in the effort, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Neither did representatives for  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors (N:GM), nor for the United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at those automakers.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 05:39PM ET</span>",Sanctions on Russian tycoon Deripaska will create global ripples,"By Katya Golubkova and Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The U.S. government's decision to include Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska on its sanctions blacklist on Friday will reverberate around the world because his business empire has a global footprint and counts major multinationals as partners.
Washington imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, 12 companies they own or control, as well as 17 senior Russian government officials because, it said, they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world.
Deripaska, estimated by Forbes magazine to have a net worth of $6.7 billion, is the main owner of the conglomerate EN+, which in turn is the co-owner of some of the world's biggest metals producers, Rusal and Nornickel.
Deripaska's inclusion on the U.S. sanctions list could potentially create complications too for companies with which he does business; they include German car giant Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and commodities trader  Glencore  (L:GLEN).
Deripaska called the U.S. decision ""very unfortunate but not unexpected.""
""Certainly the grounds for putting my name on the list of SDNs as provided by U.S. officials are groundless, ridiculous and absurd,"" he said, in a statement sent to Reuters by Basic Element, one of his businesses. SDN stands for ""Specially Designated National.""
Hong Kong-listed Rusal is one of the world's biggest aluminum producers. It says exports to the United States account for over 10 percent of its output. 
Rusal owns assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea. It owns a stake in Australian QAL, the world’s top alumina refinery.
Nornickel has assets in Finland, in Australia, where it holds a license to develop the Honeymoon Well Project, and in South Africa, where it has a 50 percent stake in the country's only nickel concentrate producer, Norilsk Nickel Nkomati.
A Nornickel representative declined to comment on the risks resulting from the sanctions on their shareholder.
FOREIGN PARTNERS
In its statement announcing the sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department said U.S. entities will be ""generally prohibited from dealings with"" the people and firms on the sanctions list. 
In addition, it said, companies outside the United States ""could face sanctions for knowingly facilitating significant transactions for or on behalf of"" sanctioned entities.
Volkswagen has a joint plant with GAZ, a Russian carmaker which is a subsidiary of Basic Element, which was also sanctioned on Friday. Under a contract that runs until 2025, the plant assembles vehicles from the Volkswagen stable.
The German automaker has been in talks to buy a stake in GAZ, five sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters in December last year.
Swiss-headquartered Glencore is a shareholder in Rusal, and his said it plans to switch those shares to Deripaska's newly-created holding company, EN+.
According to a Rusal prospectus, its major customers include Glencore, Toyota (T:7203), and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Alcan.
Other foreign firms with ties to Deripaska's empire include Austrian construction company Strabag, in which the Russian's firm Rasperia has a blocking stake, and Singapore's Changi Airports International, which is a partner with a Deripaska-owned airports firm.
KREMLIN CONNECTIONS
In his life and career, Deripaska has frequently intersected with the Kremlin and Russian officialdom.
He holds regular meetings with President Vladimir Putin, he invested heavily in building infrastructure for Russia's 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are indivisible from the state's interests.
The mother of Deripaska's children, Polina, is the daughter of Valentin Yumashev, who was presidential chief of staff under former Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Yumashev later married Yeltsin’s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko. Yeltsin and his entourage were instrumental in elevating Vladimir Putin to power as the anointed successor to the ailing president.
In February, the website of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny published a report alleging that Deripaska met Sergei Prikhodko, Russia’s deputy prime minister, on a yacht belonging to the businessman off the coast of Norway in 2016. 
Deripaska accused Navalny and others of spreading lies that he had committed unlawful actions and obtained an injunction from a court requiring media outlets stop disseminating the disputed content. The Russian state telecoms watchdog blocked Navalny’s website.
TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER
Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort, who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump when he was running for president. 
At the time he was doing business with Deripaska, Manafort, a Republican operative, was providing campaign advice to Viktor Yanukovich, a pro-Moscow challenger for the presidency of Ukraine. Yanukovich was elected president in 2010.
A Cyprus-based company tied to Deripaska, Surf Horizon Limited, sued Manafort and his aide Rick Gates, in a New York state court in January, accusing them of misappropriating more than $18.9 million earmarked for deals in Ukraine in 2008. 
That lawsuit emanated from a business partnership that dates to 2006 when Manafort and Gates convinced Deripaska to invest in a private equity fund that would make investments primarily in Russia and Ukraine, according to an offering memorandum referenced in the lawsuit.
Jeffrey Eilender, who is representing Manafort in the lawsuit, told Reuters last month he planned to argue for dismissal based in part on the assertion that Surf Horizon’s claims are past the statute of limitations.
On Friday, Eilender said he believed the sanctions would make the pursuit of the lawsuit meaningless. “As a practical matter, he can’t take money or assets out of the United States,” Eilender said, referring to Deripaska. Gates currently does not have counsel in the Surf Horizon case.
Despite the lawsuit, Manafort sought to stay in contact with the oligarch. Last year the Washington Post reported that Manafort sent an email in July 2016 through an intermediary offering Deripaska “private briefings” about Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Manafort was chairman of the campaign at the time.

Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni has said the email ex­changes were “innocuous” and aimed at collecting money owed by past clients.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Trump to mull U.S. biofuels policy options in cabinet meeting Monday,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will review a list of potential changes to the nation's renewable fuel laws at a meeting with members of his cabinet on Monday, two sources said, as biofuels groups warned against any action that would weaken ethanol demand.
Trump in recent months has waded deep into the controversial issue of reforming the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a 2005 law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel pool each year, or buy credits from those who do.
Merchant refiners like Valero and PBF Energy pulled Trump into the debate, arguing that complying with the regulation has grown too costly and will kill off the types of blue-collar jobs Trump had promised to defend. 
But Trump's efforts to reform the law have been met by fierce opposition from corn farmers and ethanol producers who are quick to remind the president that he also vowed to preserve the RFS during corn-belt campaign stops.
Monday's meeting will include Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue. Pruitt heads into the meeting under pressure from lawmakers to resign over allegations he broke ethics rules by renting a room in a Washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist.
Pruitt and Perdue have spent the last several weeks compiling a list of options for Trump to consider on the RFS, ranging from more aggressive tactics like capping the prices of blending credits, called RINs, to lifting seasonal restrictions on high-ethanol gasoline sales.
""A waiver or cap on RIN prices would fundamentally undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard and deal a massive blow to rural America,"" Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a statement on Friday. 
In recent weeks, advisers have urged Trump to let lawmakers tackle the issue, and only use the threat of executive action to coerce them to make it a priority. 
Iowa farmers and biofuel groups sent a letter to Grassley and fellow Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst on Friday, urging them to reach out to Trump to express their anger.
""Any Administration action to waive or cap RINs will be viewed as nothing less than a declaration of war on rural America and a complete abdication of his repeated promises to protect the RFS,” said the letter, orchestrated by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.

Biofuel groups are also frustrated with the administration over reports that the EPA was exempting small refineries from the program, including three owned by one of the nation's largest refining companies, Andeavor.

77,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Mexico Stocks Are Having a Great Week, But Itau Sees Risks Ahead","(Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks are on track for their best week since December 2016 on optimism that policy makers will reach an initial resolution on Nafta as soon as next week.
A preliminary trade deal would remove one of the overhangs that has made it hard to value local stocks, and the benchmark gauge has surged 3.9 percent over the past five days, making it the world’s best performing index in what was a volatile week for stocks globally.
Mexican equities have outperformed emerging-market counterparts as well as U.S. benchmarks this year. But analysts at Itau BBA warn that investors are ignoring risks like the potential for corporate earnings to falter amid slower economic growth or for July’s election to produce a president who is seen as unfriendly to business.
Some risks do appear to be priced in, analysts led by Gregorio Tomassi wrote in a report. Before this week, Mexican stocks had fallen 6.6 percent this year, which dragged price-to-estimated-earnings ratios back down near their 10-year average of 15. That’s below where most other global stock markets are trading, according to the report.
Still, Itau says stock weakness is likely as analysts and economists start trimming their earnings and gross domestic product estimates soon, given that the economy will probably face “transition challenges” next year, regardless of who is elected.
And of course there’s no guarantee on Nafta. The negotiations could become a source of anxiety for companies again if talks extend beyond the July 1 ballot, Itau says.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","As China ties up global lithium, Asian rivals must bet big on South America","By Dave Sherwood and Nicole Mordant
SANTIAGO/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - South America's lithium triangle is the lowest-cost place to produce the vital battery ingredient, but political hurdles will require Japanese and South Korean companies to make big investments to crack into the region as they chase Chinese rivals who have tied up resources in other parts of the world.
Even China, the leader in the global race for the metal used in batteries for everything from smartphones to electric cars, has had its efforts thwarted in the lithium triangle of Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, home to around two thirds of global reserves.
Because of China's problems, market experts say the lithium triangle is one place South Korean and Japanese auto and battery makers can play catch-up.
The race will go to whichever producers can best navigate policy obstacles in all three countries. But Panasonic, Samsung (KS:005930) and other South Korean and Japanese companies focused on long-term supply contracts find themselves further behind the Chinese, who have been aggressively going after physical assets elsewhere, such as purchasing their own mines.
JOLTED OUT OF COMFORT ZONES
South Korean and Japanese firms have relied largely on South American lithium, and formed longstanding relationships with producers there. But they have been jolted out of their comfort zones in the last year as China has engaged in a deal-making spree elsewhere in the world, spurred by government quotas for electric car sales. 
The Japanese and Koreans are ""certainly looking for supplies"" in South America, said Henk van Alphen, CEO of small Chilean lithium brine developer  Wealth Minerals Ltd  (V:WML), which has held talks with battery makers from both countries. 
Japanese and Korean companies have dipped a toe in backing new lithium mine developers, including in Latin America where Japanese carmaker Toyota (T:8105) invested in an Argentine lithium project. Company executives and government officials from those countries say more is needed. 
""How to secure metal supplies is one of the interests I have these days,"" Park Jin-soo, chief executive and vice chairman of LG Chem (KS:051910) told reporters in Daesan, South Korea, last month. 
""We could consider cooperating with companies which have such metals, or if needed, a joint venture or a long-term deal, and we are making a lot of plans for the next few years."" 
A Korean official said the government was looking at how to back the private sector. Previous efforts by Korean state development agencies have been halting, especially in Bolivia where a lithium initiative is mired in debt. 
""We are currently focused on giving support to the private sector like POSCO or  Samsung SDI  on the sideline,"" said the official speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Japan's Panasonic Corp (T:6752) is ""working to secure stable supplies of battery materials, through such steps as directly sourcing raw materials and diversifying sourcing channels"", said a spokeswoman, declining to comment on specific regions.
In February, a delegation of dozens of Japanese companies toured Argentine provinces that are home to most of that country's lithium reserves. 
THE REAL PRIZE 
Chinese companies have aggressively pursued supply elsewhere, inking several deals with mine developers in Australia, Canada and Africa in the past year. 
In Chile, however, the Chinese have struggled to get a significant foothold in the lithium industry, leaving an opening for others. 
Authorities in Chile balked when Chinese lithium giant Tianqi moved to purchase a coveted 32 percent stake in Chile's SQM, the world's lowest cost producer. Chile development agency Corfo filed a complaint with anti-trust regulators to block the sale.
Now Tianqi is talking to Chile's top anti-trust prosecutor about the yet-to-be-inked deal (N:SQM) (SN:SQM_pb). 
Such a deal would be ""nerve-wracking for Korean and Japanese companies"" who have long-standing arrangements with the producers like SQM, said van Alphen, of Wealth Minerals. These relationships would be rocked if Tianqi purchased even a minority stake in the top producer. 
South Korean battery maker Samsung SDI (KS:006400) and metals supplier Posco have committed to building a battery materials plant in Chile in exchange for securing lithium at a discount from SQM and U.S.-based  Albemarle  (N:ALB), the country's two biggest producers. 
""Why stick a cathode facility in Chile? It is likely to be more expensive than in Korea or China or Japan. It is all to do with security of supply,"" said Robert Baylis, managing director at ‎consultants Roskill Information Services in London. 
The real prize, according to a source with knowledge of the transactions, is a toehold in Chile's lithium industry and the possibility for eventual expansion. 
Chile has proven particularly hard to court, prioritizing access and increased production quotas for SQM and Albemarle and more recently, state miner Codelco. 
The country has also been closely guarding entry of new miners, encouraging companies to do business with known entities. Yet investors are watching a handful of smaller deals in the lithium triangle which could hint at potential openings in Chile for newcomers seeking reliable physical assets. 
Topping those deals is Salar Blanco, a project controlled by Lithium Power International of Australia and Canada's Bearing Lithium, which in March secured a rare Chilean export permit. 
There are also opportunities in Argentina and Canada where companies can jump on investments if they move swiftly. 
""If you look at the emerging low-cost lithium chemical projects such as Cauchari, Sal de Vida (Argentina), and Nemaska (Canada), said Joe Lowry, an independent industry consultant who worked for U.S.-based lithium producer  FMC Corp  (N:FMC). The most appealing thing about those projects, he added, is that:

""China has limited participation.""

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Shares of Brazil's biggest utility, Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET6), fell more than 10 percent in Sao Paulo on Friday after news of a shakeup at the Mines and Energy Ministry that could threaten a government plan to privatize the company.
The decline in shares of Eletrobras, as the company is known, wiped nearly $1 billion off its market capitalization.
Paulo Pedrosa, second in charge at the ministry, decided to step down from his post, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters, adding to upheaval on the day that Minister Fernando Coelho Filho is stepping down to run for the Congress.
Pedrosa, an experienced technocrat, had been seen as a likely replacement for Coelho Filho, according to analysts. He has been leading efforts to overhaul electricity sector rules and played a key role in government plans to privatize state-controlled Eletrobras.
Gustavo Miele, an analyst with the equity research team at investment bank Itau BBA, said Pedrosa's departure was negative.
""We believe that Mr. Pedrosa would be one of the best names to replace Mr. Coelho Filho in the Ministry of Mines and Energy,"" he said in a note.
""The announcement has a relevant impact on Eletrobras' capitalization. We believe that this process strongly depends, among other points, on a pro-market name taking over the ministry,"" Miele said in a note to clients.
The ministry declined to comment immediately on the matter. Fernando Coelho Filho is one of a dozen cabinet ministers who are leaving the government to run in the October general election.
Coelho Filho had brought Pedrosa and a team of officials with technical profiles to the ministry, many with experience in private-sector power companies, which improved investors' outlook for the sector. 
Another source told Reuters on Friday that Moreira Franco, the secretary of the Presidency and a leading figure in the governing Brazilian Democratic Movement party, is a top candidate to take over the ministry.

The Eletrobras privatization has faced opposition from several politicians, including members of the MDB, and the prospect of a person with a strong political profile taking over the energy post is seen as negative by investors.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Canadian Pacific Railway  (TO:CP) conductors and locomotive engineers on Friday voted to authorize a strike action that could have the 3,000 workers walk off the job as early as April 21, Teamsters Canada said in a statement. 
The workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, are asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands, a Teamsters spokesman said by telephone. 
The union also said in the statement that it opposes cuts and concessions requested by CP, because the company is reporting higher profits and strong fundamentals.
A spokesman for CP, Canada's second-largest railroad, could not be immediately reached for comment.
“We have come to a point where Teamsters are prepared to go on strike for the third time in six years to obtain a fair and reasonable contract renewal,” Doug Finnson, president of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, said in the statement.
CP and the union have clashed in recent years, when the railroad's former CEO, the late Hunter Harrison, cut costs at the Calgary-based company to improve efficiency. Current Chief Executive Keith Creel met with the union last year, striking a more conciliatory tone.
The labor unrest comes at a time of tighter rail capacity in Canada, with CP and rival Canadian National Railway (TO:CNR) facing strong demand for grain shipments and other commodities.
The union said a ratification vote is underway at CN that would guarantee ""labor peace for the foreseeable future.""

81,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Rival banks applauded U.S. watchdog on 2016 Wells Fargo settlement: emails,"By Michelle Price and Elizabeth Dilts
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rival lenders privately congratulated the top U.S. consumer watchdog on its $100 million settlement with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) over the bank's phony accounts scandal, according to internal documents published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this week.
On Sept. 8, 2016, the CFPB and two other regulators announced they had reached settlements totaling $190 million with Wells Fargo after discovering the third-largest U.S. lender had opened as many as 2.1 million bank and card accounts in customers' names without their permission. 
The number of potentially affected customers subsequently grew to 3.5 million as Wells expanded its probe of sales abuses.
The CFPB's portion of the settlement was $100 million, making it the largest fine in the agency's short history. 
The settlement sparked a flurry of internal back-patting among enforcement officials in the days that followed and, unusually, drew applause from other banks, according to internal emails published following a Freedom of Information Request.
""I have had a number of bankers reach out to me to express gratitude for the CFPB's action against [Wells Fargo] and disgust that such a situation occurred,"" Gary Stein, a manager in the CFPB's office of deposits, wrote in an email to Melissa Baal Guidorizzi, senior counsel for enforcement, on Sept. 12, 2016. 
""While many were from community banks, not all were. I don’t recall an action like this we have taken getting so much applause and so little pushback.""
The next day, Baal Guidorizzi forwarded the feedback to the broader CFPB enforcement team, the documents show.
""Seems that the case was popular even in the banking community. I am hoping that this feedback will help balance some of the concerns about 'industry' reaction in our future work. Congratulations again to the team!"" she wrote.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn declined to comment.
Wells had long been celebrated on Wall Street for its ""cross-sell"" ratio, which measured its ability to sell multiple products to each customer. But the metric had been questioned by envious rivals who struggled to achieve the same results.
In interviews after the Wells Fargo scandal erupted, executives from other banks told Reuters they believed Wells went awry by measuring employee performance through sales and product numbers in its retail operation, rather than using customer service metrics. 
The bankers said at the time that while incentive programs differed, it was standard across the industry to incorporate customer feedback when considering employee rewards.
Wells has since changed the way it measures sales performance.

A spokesman for the CFPB declined to comment.

93,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ukraine's largest airline may sue again in tussle with Ryanair,"By Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk
KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's largest airline may launch new legal action over the entry of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA) into the market if its complaints over airport slots are not addressed, its chief executive told Reuters on Friday.
The Western-backed government feted Ryanair's expected arrival in September as a sign of its pro-business credentials to attract foreign investors and prise open sectors traditionally dominated by local tycoons.
But Ukraine International Airlines, which is part-owned by one of the country's richest magnates, Ihor Kolomoisky, says the Kiev authorities have gone out of their way to support Ryanair while being slow to help local carriers grow.
UIA launched legal action against the government last year and Ryanair walked away from talks saying Ukraine was ""not yet a sufficiently mature or reliable business location"". Ryanair returned after more negotiations backed by the president.
In his first interview since Ryanair announced its entry on March 23, UIA's CEO Yuri Miroshnikov said Ryanair has started selling tickets for flights at Kiev's Boryspil airport without getting permission for the timings.
""Slots which they are expecting to receive are all occupied by Ukraine International flights, transit flights, where the connecting times are very important, where we know, we already understand that airport infrastructure in these peak times is a bottleneck for us,"" he said.
""I can have only one explanation: They (Ryanair) hope and believe that under pressure from various sources the issue somehow will be resolved (in their favor),"" he said. ""And they don't care.""
""If that solution will damage Ukraine International, yes we definitely will protect our interests in the court,"" he said, without specifying whom UIA would take to court.
""Ryanair's schedule has been constructed outside of Kiev Boryspil's peak slot times and we will continue to work closely with the airport on all planning,"" Ryanair said in emailed comments to Reuters.
""Hysterical utterances from the high fares UIA are just another example of their desire to block competition rather than giving Ukrainian customers the low fares they really want.""
Boryspil said the airport would not be able to accommodate the timings for which Ryanair is selling tickets.
""We can say that they started selling tickets without having received an agreement on slots at our airport ... What's more, they haven't even asked us about slots yet,"" it said by email.
Ryanair would either have to move its flights to off-peak hours or increase the number of flights to 15 a day from their stated number of 4-5 flights, which would make it economically viable for the airport to open another terminal, it said.
""I sincerely hope that the president of Ukraine or the infrastructure minister won't concern themselves with slot issues,"" Infrastructure Minister Volodymyr Omelyan said. ""I don't have a single doubt that Ryanair will start flights and the people who have already bought or are buying tickets will use the services of this airline.""
UIA says it is in favor of competition provided that it is fair, and the new incentives the government has offered to all airlines in the wake of negotiations with Ryanair, which include lower airport taxes, will also benefit UIA. 

It was a ""good outcome for the wrong reason,"" Miroshnikov said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Latin American currencies weakened on Friday after China fought back against a new U.S. threat to increase tariffs on Chinese goods.
China warned it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"" of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on President Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods.
The warning came after Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a high-stakes confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world's two biggest economies.
""It's still a battle of words at this time but that is enough to pull down prices,"" Guide Investimentos analysts wrote in a client note.
The currencies of Brazil (BRBY), Mexico , Chile  and Colombia  weakened between 0.1 and 0.9 percent in early trading, despite data showing the U.S. economy in March created the fewest jobs in six months.
A weak labor market could drive the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a slower pace than expected in coming months, potentially boosting the allure of emerging market assets.
Stock markets were also down across the region due to global risk aversion, with MSCI's Latin American index (MILA00000PUS) down 1.75 percent, its biggest daily loss in two months.
Brazil's benchmark stock index (BVSP) led the declines, falling 1.1 percent. 

Shares of drug retailer RD (SA:RADL3) were among the biggest decliners after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut its recommendation for the stock to ""underperform"" from ""outperform"" in the wake of hefty losses.

The leadership of the Kovo union, which represents industrial workers, plans to vote on the proposal next Wednesday, which would cover the period from April 1, 2018 to the end of March 2019, although that is seen as a formality. The offer also includes increases in bonuses and incentives.
Czech wages have been rising rapidly across sectors, putting pressure on employers, following strong economic growth in recent years and a fall in unemployment to its lowest level in two decades.

Skoda, the country's biggest exporter, has blossomed under nearly 30 years of Volkswagen ownership to become one of the group's profit drivers, even beating operating margins at luxury brands Audi (DE:NSUG) and BMW (DE:BMWG) last year.

“I’m not saying there won’t be a little pain,” Trump said Friday during an interview on WABC Radio’s “Bernie & Sid in the Morning’’ program. “ So we might lose a little of it but we’re going to have a much stronger country when we’re finished, and that’s what I’m all about.’’
Trump ordered his administration Thursday evening to consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports, sending U.S. stock futures tumbling. In a statement Thursday, Trump cited “China’s unfair retaliation” in response to his list of proposed tariffs earlier this week covering $50 billion in Chinese products.
U.S. stocks have fluctuated drastically for much of the past month as Trump has intensified punitive trade actions against several countries. Trump, who in the past has hailed the rising stock prices during his tenure, has spoken less about the markets as they have retreated from record highs this year.
Trump claimed in the interview Friday that “the market’s gone up 40 percent or 42 percent.”
Since Trump was inaugurated, the S&P 500 is up 17 percent, the Dow up 24 percent and the Nasdaq up 27 percent. Since his election, the S&P 500 is up 33 percent, the Dow up 44 percent and the Nasdaq up 44 percent, even with recent losses.
“We have to do things that other people wouldn’t do. So we may take a hit, but you know what, ultimately we’re going to be much stronger for it,’’ Trump said during the radio interview on Friday. “It’s something we had to do, and ultimately if you take a look it’s not only trade with China -- it’s everybody.""
Responding to Trump’s Thursday action, China said it would counter U.S. protectionism ""to the end, and at any cost,"" as a war of words over Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports escalated.
""The Chinese side will follow suit to the end and at any cost, and will firmly attack, using new comprehensive countermeasures, to firmly defend the interest of the nation and its people,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on its website on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico increased its projected five-year cash surplus to $7.36 billion in a revised fiscal turnaround plan on Thursday night, but did not include layoffs or pension cuts that have been urged by the insolvent island's federally-appointed oversight board. 
Puerto Rico, which is in bankruptcy with $120 billion in debt while it struggles to recover from September's devastating Hurricane Maria, is required to submit a turnaround plan as a basis for planned restructuring talks with bondholders. 
The board, created by the U.S. Congress to manage the U.S. territory's finances, can impose its own plan if it rejects the one submitted by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. 
The two sides have spent months negotiating a consensual plan, but remain apart on key issues after several drafts. Rossello has vowed to fight the board's proposed 10 percent pension cuts, as well as some elements of labor reform.
The governor has also insisted he can achieve the board's requested level of spending cuts without layoffs in the public sector workforce, which the board has been skeptical about.
The board has set an April 20 deadline to approve a turnaround plan for the island. 
While it has extended several past deadlines to continue talks with the governor, a source familiar with the board's thinking told Reuters on Thursday the board would certify a plan one way or the other on April 20, even if it meant altering the plan to include some of the initiatives resisted by Rossello.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is seeking to buy around 110 fighter jets, the air force said in a request for information issued on Friday, marking a first step toward a long-delayed deal that could be worth more than $15 billion.
Boeing (N:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) , Saab (ST:SAABb) and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) are among the manufacturers expected to compete.
The planes must be built largely in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to build a domestic industrial base. 
The air force said in a notice that ""85 percent will have to be made in India by a Strategic Partner/Indian Production Agency"". 
The tender will be open for makers of both single engine and twin-engined combat jets, in a widening of the field. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also potential contenders under the new requirements.
A spokesman for Dassault Aviation which makes the twin-engine Rafale declined to comment. 
Earlier, the defense ministry had sought expressions of interest from single-engine manufacturers which effectively restricted the contest to Lockheed's F-16 and Saab's Gripen fighter jets.
But in February the government asked the air force to open up the competition to twin-engined aircraft, in the latest flip-flop in policy that has delayed the acquisition process for years and left the air force short of hundreds of planes.
India began its search for new planes for the Indian air force in 2003 to replace its Soviet-era MiG fighters.
Lockheed has teamed with India's Tata Advanced Systems to build the planes locally while Sweden's Saab has entered into a partnership with the Adani Group, a resources conglomerate. The other contenders have not announced their local partners. 
The request for information is open until July, the air force said.

A request for proposal will then be issued followed by bid evaluations and contract negotiations. The process could take years, officials say.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Russian insurers may need more state support: lobby,"By Tatiana Voronova and Denis Pinchuk
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's banking crisis and a weak economy could spell more trouble for its insurance sector, requiring further state support following the bailout of top insurer Rosgosstrakh last year, the head of the country's main insurance lobby said.
Russia's financial industry has been hit hard by the fallout from Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the economic impact of a sharp fall in oil prices.
Three major private banks had to be rescued by the central bank last year, alongside Rosgosstrakh. 
""The insurance sector is not immune to the diseases of the national economy,"" Igor Yurgens, president of All-Russia Insurance Association, told Reuters in an interview.
""There are big (insurance) firms highly dependent on the banking sector,"" he said. Leading Russian banks such as Sberbank (MM:SBER), VTB (MM:VTBR), Alfabank and Uralsib own insurers, though none has shown any signs of trouble so far.
A draft bill under discussion in parliament envisages the creation of a Fund for the Consolidation of the Insurance Sector, similar to the one that was set up for struggling banks. 
The fund, to be run by the central bank, will pave the way for ailing insurers to be bailed out in case of an ""unsustainable financial position that threatens insurants... other parties or the state, as well as the stability of financial markets,"" according to the text of the draft bill. 
The central bank can then sell on the insurer once its rescue has been completed, it said. 
""The bailout scheme may increase confidence in the insurance market as it will boost the protection for its customers,"" Yurgens said.
The size of the planned insurance fund has not been disclosed, but central bank deputy head Vladimir Chistukhin indicated last year it would be smaller than its banking twin, which has so far pumped more than 2 trillion roubles ($35 billion) into troubled lenders.
Insurance contracts in Russia totaled 1.28 trillion roubles in 2017, official data shows.
The central bank has already spent 66 billion roubles to prop up Rosgosstrakh, which was part of the wider financial group that also owned the country's biggest private bank Otkritie, rescued last year.
SANCTIONS
Russia set up the Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC) last year to cater for firms that have been blacklisted by Western reinsurers because of the sanctions. 
Yurgens said that Chinese reinsurers, including China Re, were also steering clear of Russian companies targeted by European and U.S. sanctions even though Beijing did not impose sanctions on Moscow and relations between the two countries were warming.
""(Those businesses) are not being reinsured abroad, even by the Chinese. For that reason, the RNRC was established and it takes on 100 percent of the risk,"" Yurgens said. 
He said the central bank would keep printing money to fund the insurance and reinsurance sectors but warned this could end up triggering an inflationary spiral.
""We will cover the things which are crucial for the country's survival, as the Soviet Union did. But it will be expensive and done at the expense of the people.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Rising trade tensions between the United States and China have sparked equity outflows over the last week, though so far there has only been a modest unwind of 2018's most popular trades, fund flows data show. 
A weekly data compilation by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) showed the third straight week of equity outflows, with redemptions of $7.2 billion, according to a note received on Friday. Bonds on the other hand recorded the biggest inflows in 12 weeks at $8.1 billion, while gold attracted $1.1 billion.
""Off to Treasury Island to flee stormy China-U.S. weather,"" BAML titled its weekly note, adding that U.S. Treasuries had seen their biggest inflows since January 2016 at $4 billion.
""(This) shows investors positioning for lower yields; BAML private client debt allocation is up to 23.3 percent...Treasury inflows are the most visible expression of positioning for risk-off to date.""
Global markets have been on a roller-coaster in recent days after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on China, stoking fears the world's two largest economies could be headed for an all-out trade war.
In his latest salvo, Trump said late on Thursday he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. Beijing warned early on Friday it would fight back ""at any cost"" with fresh measures to safeguard its interests.
Yet the ups and downs this week suggest investors are not yet convinced the dispute will mushroom into a full-blown trade war that threatens global economic growth.
Emerging markets still enjoyed inflows into debt and equity funds of $5.4 billion, with cumulative emerging market inflows now at an all-time high of $363 billion. 
""(The) inability of (U.S. 10-year Treasuries) to break 3 percent and stubborn U.S. dollar weakness helps explain emerging market resilience to rising trade war concerns,"" BAML concluded. 
Looking at the year's most crowded trades - betting on short volatility and U.S. Treasuries and a rise in tech and bank stocks as well as large and mid-cap firms across wider developed market - showed a ""modest unwind"", BAML found. 
Tech stocks - which had driven much of the global equity rally in recent months before taking a hefty beating in the past weeks - suffered some outflows. Yet it is far from capitulation, BAML said, noting redemptions from tech of $300 million and consumer funds at $1.1 billion looked ""very modest relative to combined $20 billion inflows past six months"". 
BAML also predicted the second quarter ""pain trade"" - or unexpected turn in the market that could catch most investors flat-footed - could be to short emerging markets and long U.S. dollar. 
For the dollar index (DXY) to break decisively above 91, wages needed to surge or average hourly earnings to rise than 0.4 percent, BAML said. 
March data, due on Friday, were expected to show U.S. non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 the previous month with average hourly earnings expected to increase 0.2 percent, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped about 2 percent on Friday, with the Dow falling more than 570 points, as U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff threat on Chinese imports fueled increasing concern over a U.S. trade war with China.
Stocks added to losses and hit session lows in afternoon trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will likely need to keep hiking interest rates to keep inflation under control and said it was too soon to know if rising trade tensions would hit the U.S. economy.
Fears of a trade war since Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports more than a month ago have kept investors on edge over concerns that such protectionist measures would hit global economic growth.
""It's a reaction to concerns about the administration's approach to trade. The market has vacillated between writing it off as just talk and assuming there could be a serious problem,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
He and others said investors also appeared to be reducing risk ahead of the weekend.
""If the market is down it often tends to accelerate on Friday. Investors don't want to take the risk of coming in Monday after having something happen over the weekend,"" Meckler said.
Trump late Thursday threatened to slap $100 billion more in tariffs on Chinese imports, while Beijing said it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"".
The trade war worries continued to pressure stocks even as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in an interview on CNBC Friday said he was cautiously hopeful the United States will reach an agreement with China on trade.
U.S. companies seen as more likely to be hit by trade tensions with China were among the biggest drags on the Dow, including Boeing (N:BA), down 3.1 percent. The S&P 500 industrials index (SPLRCI), down 2.7 percent, had the biggest losses among sectors, though selling was broad-based.
Chipmakers, which as a group rely on China for about a quarter of their revenue, also declined. The Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) fell 3.1 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 572.46 points, or 2.34 percent, to 23,932.76, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 58.37 points, or 2.19 percent, to 2,604.47 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 161.44 points, or 2.28 percent, to 6,915.11.
The S&P 500 ended just above its 200-day moving average after trading well below that key support level that is watched by technical analysts.
Powell, who was speaking on the U.S. economic outlook in Chicago, also said the labor market appeared close to full employment. It was his first speech on the economic outlook since taking over as chairman on Feb. 5.
Before the session started, a Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by a smaller-than-expected 103,000 last month. While annual growth in average hourly earnings rose to 2.7 percent, it stayed below the 3 percent that economists estimate is needed to lift inflation toward the Federal Reserve's 2-percent target.
""There was a hope that if he had a more dovish tone that that might be a counterbalance to the trade headwinds out there,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 percent, the Dow was down 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq was down 2.1 percent.
Facebook (O:FB) share were down 1.3 percent. It backed for the first time proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads and introduced a new verification process for people buying ""issue"" ads, which have been used to sow discord online.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.59-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 64 new lows.

About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Hermes, known for its squared silk scarves as well as its hand-stitched $10,000 Kelly or Birkin bags, trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is famed for attracting long waiting lists. 
Like luxury peers, Hermes benefited from strong appetite from Asian shoppers in 2017, lifting its sales and profits to record levels.
In the fourth quarter, sales growth slowed slightly from the previous three months, however, as stocks of its handbags ran low. 
Hermes, originally a saddle and equestrian equipment maker, said its 16th leather goods workshop, located in the country not far from the city of Mulhouse, would eventually house 260 specialists trained to hand-craft a bag from start to finish. 
Vuitton is also expanding its leather goods production with at least two new domestic workshops this year and next.
Hermes has tended to pick sites in rural areas for its plants, hiring locally and training staff-in house, for workshops of around 300 people maximum. 
Hermes also plans two more production sites in France by 2020, and currently employs around 3,310 leather goods workers making everything from saddles to wallets. 
France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialisation. 

The industrial sector saw its first net job creation since 2001 in the last three months of 2017, national statistics showed last month.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 01:44PM ET</span>",Netflix offering more than $300 million for billboard company: sources,"By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) is offering more than $300 million to buy a company that owns billboards across Los Angeles, including on West Hollywood's famed Sunset Strip, a move that could help it save money maintaining a high profile in the world's entertainment capital, according to people familiar with the matter.
The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world's biggest film and TV producers. 
Netflix's motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" drama series. 
A billboard ad on Los Angeles's Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.
""This is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,"" Lowenthal said. ""Los Angeles matters to the people in the industry.""
Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Hulu and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and traditional media companies such as Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.
Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment. 
ANALOG ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT 
The world's leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip. 
Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.
It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company's website. 
Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing ""a little faster"" than its revenue.
As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix's expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017, more than any direct competitor.
""As the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,"" Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.

Netflix's first known acquisition was last year's purchase of comic book publisher Millarworld for an undisclosed sum.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>","Wall St. week ahead: High stakes, high expectations as earnings season heats up","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rockiest U.S. stock market in two years will meet a major test in the coming weeks as first-quarter earnings pour in, with expectations that tax cuts will help Corporate America show its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years. Any disappointments could further upset the fragile market. 
Hopes among stock investors are running high for corporate earnings season, which kicks off in earnest on Thursday and Friday with reports from several large financial institutions including BlackRock (N:BLK) and JP Morgan (N:JPM). 
Investors have counted on corporate profits to provide bedrock support as the market endured sharp swings in recent weeks over concerns about a trade war with China and tougher regulations for high-flying technology companies. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) has recovered some after swooning more than 10 percent in February from its Jan. 26 record high, confirming a market correction for the first time in just over two years. The benchmark index remains more than 7 percent off its all-time peak.
""There is an awful lot of pressure for corporate profits in this first quarter and especially the guidance the companies are going to give to really get this market back on its upward track,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
Analysts expect S&P 500 profits to rise 18.4 percent in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the first full quarter since passage of President Donald Trump's tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That would be the biggest profit rise since the first quarter of 2011. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2H0PB4A)
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts calculated that more than one third of that growth in the first quarter can be attributed to tax benefits. 
For a graphic on big first quarter seen for Corporate America, click https://reut.rs/2q8lxdE
Given the tendency of companies to report results above Wall Street estimates, those numbers might be expected to come in even higher. For example, first-quarter profits should rise by 24 percent if results achieve the median out-performance of the past eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio.
“A downside risk is that everyone is hoping for the earnings to come through and that is really a main pillar for the bull case,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""And if earnings surprise to the downside then you have to say, what is the bull case hanging onto at this point?""
Expectations for first quarter profits have risen from an expectation of 12.2 percent growth on Jan. 1 to 18.4 percent now, an increase of 6.2 percentage points as analysts have factored in the new tax law. 
That is unusual: In general, estimates decline by about 4 percentage points from the start of a quarter to the beginning of earnings season, according to Thomson Reuters data, which strategists say tends to help companies to post earnings ""beats"" when they ultimately report results.
""The expectation bar is a little bit higher this quarter because you didn’t see that cut ahead of time,"" Lerner said.
The very early returns indicate first-quarter results show similar positive surprises to past quarters. Of 23 S&P 500 companies reported so far, 74 percent have reported profits ahead of estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Historically, 64 percent of companies beat estimates in a quarter. More recently, performance versus expectations has been better: over the past four quarters, 75 percent of companies beat earnings estimates.
Seven more S&P 500 companies are expected to report next week including BlackRock, which is the world's largest asset manager, and three big banks: JP Morgan,  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). More than 60 S&P 500 reports are due the following week.
One cushion for investors is that stocks are generally trading at less expensive valuations following the market's slide. The S&P 500 recently traded at 16.3 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, down from 18.6 times in January, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
S&P 500 companies are expected to increase profits by 19.7 percent in 2018, which would be the biggest annual rise since 2010. In their quarterly reports, corporate executives will give forecasts or insight into prospects for the year. Some strategists said recent policy and market turbulence could lead companies to temper their views.
“Given the uncertainty that is in the market, especially regarding trade and potential tech regulation, we could see management teams be a little more cautious,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.

Some $4 billion went into government/U.S. Treasury funds in the week through April 4, the bank said in a report, citing data from EPFR Global. Investors pulled out $7.2 billion from stock funds, including $9.9 billion from the U.S. and $2.4 billion from Europe, while Japanese and emerging-market equity funds saw inflows.
The Treasury inflows are the “most visible expression of positioning for risk-off to date,” Bank of America strategists including Michael Hartnett in New York, wrote in the note. “We still think ‘sell-any-rip’ is a much better 2018 strategy,” than “buy-the-dip,” they said.
Investors are returning to Treasuries as the U.S. 10-year yield retreats from its 2018 high of 2.95 percent set in February. The yield declined one basis point to 2.82 percent as investors awaited the March U.S. jobs report and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech on economic outlook, both later today.
Concern about the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute and uncertainty over the pace of Fed rate increases have capped expectations the psychologically important 3 percent level will be breached in the short-term.
Investors pulled $300 million from technology stocks and added $1.1 billion to precious metals funds. In a sign some investors are still in risk-on mode, cumulative emerging-market inflows from the start of 2004 are now at a record $363 billion, according to the report.

Nestle is facing off with AgeCore, a Geneva-based group representing six European retailers, including Edeka, which is seeking better supply terms.
Germany's Lebensmittel Zeitung late on Thursday cited a letter Edeka had sent to its 5,900 supermarkets suggesting that they stop ordering further Nestle products including the KitKat brand of chocolate bars, Vittel drinks and Wagner frozen pizza.
The boycott had so far affected 163 Nestle products, equal to around 20 percent of revenue the chain generates with Nestle products, the magazine said. That figure will rise to 30 percent with the expanded measures, the magazine said, without saying how many products they would affect.
Edeka declined to comment on the letter on Friday. A spokesman for Nestle referred to comments the company's Chief Executive Mark Schneider made to a newspaper last week, while declining to provide further information.
Schneider had told Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview that Nestle was still negotiating with Agecore to end the spat and hoped to find a sensible solution.

""This aggressive approach coordinated across Europe (of withdrawing products from supermarket shelves to enforce price reductions) is new, particularly in Switzerland,"" Schneider said.

While U.S. stock-index futures fell after Trump’s move, investor reaction in equity markets across Asia wasn’t as big. Japan’s Topix index and South Korea’s Kospi gauge both slipped 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.1 percent after a holiday Thursday. China’s stock and currency markets are shut until Monday due to its annual tomb-sweeping holidays. China later said it would counter U.S. protectionism “to the end, and at any cost.”
“It’s becoming childish,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. “At some point investors will say enough is enough, there’s just too much political volatility now.”
‘Out of Love’
""The U.S. stock market is taking Trump’s escalation poorly, eroding support amongst the plutocracy,"" said Gary Greenberg, London-based head of global emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management. On the other hand, China’s tariffs on U.S. are well targeted as voters in agricultural states are “falling out of love” with Trump.
China, as world’s second largest economy, can afford to lose 25 basis points of growth for two or three years due to higher tariffs, he added.
Just Noise
“The reality is that the fundamental backdrop for markets hasn’t changed,” said Kerry Craig, Melbourne-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. It will be increasingly important for investors to know what stocks they own as fraying trade relations will lead to more market volatility, he added.
“The noise is distracting when nothing else is happening, a solid 2Q earnings season in the U.S. could see investors refocus on fundamentals and the corporate outlook,” Craig said.
Up at 3 a.m.
“I get up up everyday to write my note and it turns completely in opposite direction. I am getting up more often than not at 3 a.m.,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp.
“There is a perception of overvaluation in equities markets. Currency markets do not care about trade war, they care about central banks. They will care when there is some timeline, some proof to the pudding.”
De-Sensitized
“One should not be surprised to find markets growing increasingly de-sensitized to such talks,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte.
A Bluff
“I continue to believe the trade war won’t happen in the end. I think it’s more like bluffing. That’s typical Trump. I read one of his books and he said he’d always act unpredictable before negotiation so he could get more bargaining power,” said Kenny Wen, strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co.
“No date has been fixed on this. It’s a complete bluff ahead of the negotiations,"" Norihiro Fujito, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.
Asean Favor
“We expect Asean markets -- in particular Singapore and Thailand -- to continue to outperform due to to their low listed equities revenue sensitivity to the U.S.,” said Jonathan Garner, strategist at Morgan Stanley.
Greed and Fear
""Be greedy when others are fearful,"" as there are many value stocks to pick such uncertain times, said Aaron Oh, Singapore-based investment analyst at Aggregate Asset Management in Singapore. Fund in focused on buying stocks in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia amid the trade war led uncertainty, Oh added.

In exchange for the support, which is given through tax incentives, La Poste will continue to operate some 9,500 outlets across the country, including rural areas, with post offices gradually being replaced by partnerships by shops and town halls.
The Commission, which oversees competition policy in the European Union, said the scheme helped the postal service to fulfill an important role without distorting competition.

The pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.45 percent by 0707 GMT, erasing only part of the 2.4 percent gain in the previous session and remained on track for a small weekly gain.
Trump on Thursday directed U.S. trade officials to identify tariffs on $100 billion more Chinese imports, upping the ante in an already high-stakes trade confrontation between the world's two largest economies.
The new warning however did not appear to change the prevailing view among investors that a full blown trade war that could threaten global growth is unlikely.
""Markets will now watch both the rhetoric from Trump’s cabinet members and China’s response to assess whether risk of a trade war is materially higher,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in its investment daily. ""We continue to see a trade war as unlikely"".
However caution dominated, prompting investors into stocks like utilities seen as more resilient to possible trade escalations. French utility Suez (PA:SEVI) led the sector higher, further boosted by a bullish broker note.
Elsewhere among top movers was Dufry (S:DUFN), up 3.5 percent after the Swiss retail company proposed a higher than expected dividend, while  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 2.2 percent after Italian state lender CDP said it would buy a stake of up to 5 percent in the telecoms company.
Tech stocks were a weak spot with chip makers like Infineon (DE:IFXGn) generally lower following losses overnight in shares in Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).

136,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Indonesia’s salt spat gives industry a shake,"By Bernadette Christina Munthe and Cindy Silviana
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's efforts to protect farmers from imports have sometimes gone spectacularly wrong, creating shortages of staples such as rice and beef, and playing havoc with markets.
Its latest misfire has come over salt, with supplies so desperately low that one of the world's biggest producers of instant noodles warned recently it could run out of the vital ingredient in a matter of weeks.
President Joko Widodo has stepped in to end a squabble between two ministries over salt import quotas.
""I think no one will have to stop operating because the government is trying to solve the problem,"" said Fransiscus Welirang, director of PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (JK:INDF), which makes the hugely popular Indomie brand of noodles.
Still, Indofood scrambled to find ways to cut its salt usage and the Indonesia Food & Beverage Association - which represents a sector with billions of dollars in revenue - said biscuit and snack makers also faced shortages.
With more than 50,000 km (31,000 miles) of coastline Indonesia is surrounded by salt water, and yet it spends tens of millions of dollars every year on imports of salt.
The problem is that Indonesia is not producing enough high-grade salt. The local salt industry could take years to increase output and quality to levels needed, and there is currently no comprehensive plan to that effect.
POLICY FLAWS
Indonesia's ambition for food self-sufficiency is partly driven by concern about a growing food import bill. The Southeast Asian nation is on track to become the world's biggest importer of wheat this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and is a major buyer of corn and beef.
Food security is also politically sensitive in Indonesia where more than 160 million people, around 60 percent of the population, live on $5.50 a day or less, according to recent World Bank data, leaving them vulnerable to price swings.
However, economists say policies such as subsidies and stockpiling aimed at controlling markets cost billions of dollars and often keep prices artificially high. 
Indonesia's domestic rice prices were 60 percent higher than international prices due to policy interventions, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a 2015 report. 
After Widodo won the presidency in 2014, he curbed or delayed imports of beef and cattle mainly from Australia as well as other foods to stimulate domestic production. 
But when prices shot up in 2016, his government scrambled to find beef from different sources, including buffalo meat from India.
The OECD has urged Indonesia to ""develop a portfolio of policies that can respond to a diversity of food insecurity scenarios, rather than focusing policy attention on domestic production of staple foods.""
CRISIS
Most salt production in Indonesia is low-tech, involving the evaporation of seawater in coastal ponds during the dry season. The current shortage is partly due to unusually heavy rains last year tied to the La Nina weather pattern.
Indonesia was forced to import 75,000 tonnes of household salt from Australia last year, and there were media reports that a vessel attempting to smuggle 15 tonnes of salt from Malaysia was intercepted by the authorities.
The shortage became a crisis this year because of bickering within the government over how much salt could be imported without contravening legal requirements to give priority to local producers.
The Fisheries Ministry recommended imports of about 2.2 million tonnes, while the Coordinating Economy Ministry called for 3.7 million tonnes.
President Widodo intervened to resolve the impasse by taking away the Fisheries Ministry's authority over industrial salt imports and handing it to the Industry Ministry.
The move angered local salt farmers who said the government was failing to develop domestic salt refining capacity.
""We need to be realistic. Industry certainly needs salt of a different quality to that produced by salt farmers,"" Widodo said on Wednesday. ""If we do not import industrial salt, industry could stop."" 
The Industry Ministry immediately recommended allowing 676,000 tonnes of industrial salt imports for 27 companies in ""critical condition"", Achmad Sigit Dwiwahjono, an official at the ministry told reporters.
He cited a company that makes contact lenses on the island of Batam that had sent home nearly half of its 3,000 workers due to the salt shortage.
SODIUM CHLORIDE
Indonesia's salt industry users association says local suppliers have struggled to expand output because of limited land on densely populated Java island and now account for only about half of the 3.9 million tonne total annual consumption.
""The Indonesian salt industry mostly comprises tens of thousands of small-scale producers on plots of one or two acres,"" said David McNeil, a London-based salt specialist at commodity research group Roskill.
""This makes it extremely difficult to raise productivity to levels seen in countries such as Australia where leading highly mechanized producers have operations covering thousands of acres.""
There is also a quality challenge. Food companies need salt with a maximum water content of 0.5 percent and sodium chloride above 97 percent, levels many domestic suppliers cannot meet.
The government has plans for 40,000 hectares of new salt farms in eastern Indonesia and more investment in salt processing to achieve self-sufficiency in the next few years. 
But the cost of development and shipping salt from East Nusa Tenggara to Java, where most industries operate, could impede this plan.

Tony Tanduk, chairman of the association of Indonesian Salt-Using Industries, said locally produced salt already costs 2,000-3,000 rupiah (15-22 U.S. cents) per kg, more than three times the cost of imported salt.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 01:05PM ET</span>",Trump threatens more China tariffs; Beijing ready to hit back,"By Michael Martina and Steve Holland
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China warned on Friday it was fully prepared to respond with a ""fierce counter strike"" of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on President Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods.
In light of what he called China's ""unfair retaliation"" against earlier U.S. trade actions, Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a tit-for-tat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world's two biggest economies.
China's Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, called the U.S. action ""extremely mistaken"" and unjustified, adding that the spat was a struggle between unilateralism and multilateralism. He also said no negotiations were likely in the current circumstances.
""The result of this behavior is to smash your own foot with a stone,"" Gao told a news briefing in Beijing. ""If the United States announces an additional $100 billion list of tariffs, China has already fully prepared, and will not hesitate to immediately make, a fierce counter strike.""
He was speaking shortly after Trump defended his proposed tariffs on U.S. radio, saying the move might cause ""a little pain"" but the United States will be better off in the long run.
Asked in an interview with New York station WABC about the effect on U.S. stock markets, Trump said the market has gone up (since he took office) ""so we might lose a little bit of it.""
""So we may take a hit and you know what, ultimately we're going to be much stronger for it.""
Financial markets have been roiled by the prospect of threats becoming action and U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday as investors worried about an escalating trade war. 
One of Trump's economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, told Bloomberg Television that Trump and America's top trade official Robert Lighthizer were ""thinking about submitting a list of suggestions to the Chinese.""
On Wednesday, China unveiled a list of 106 U.S. goods - from soybeans and whiskey to frozen beef and aircraft - targeted for tariffs, retaliating just hours after the Trump administration proposed duties on some 1,300 Chinese industrial, technology, transport and medical products.
Washington called for those $50 billion in extra duties after it said an investigation had determined that Chinese government policies are designed to transfer U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies and allow them to seize leadership in key high-technology industries of the future. 
China said it was not afraid of a trade war, even though it did not seek one, and accused the United States of provoking the conflict. Gao said comments from U.S. officials about ongoing talks about trade issues were incorrect. 
""Under these conditions, the two sides cannot conduct any negotiations on this issue,"" Gao said, without elaborating.
Kudlow, who has repeatedly sought this week to soothe markets with mention of possible talks, told Bloomberg Television that there were always ongoing discussions on trade between the United States and China but that negotiations on the tariffs had not begun.
Seeking to tamp down alarm, he told reporters outside the White House, ""so nothing's happened. Nothing's been executed ... There's no there there yet, but there will be.""
CHINA'S ROLE
While Beijing calls Washington the aggressor and says it is spurring global protectionism, China's trading partners have complained for years that it abuses World Trade Organization rules and propagates unfair policies that lock foreign firms out of some sectors. China has promised repeatedly to open up sectors such as financial services. 
President Xi Jinping is expected to unveil fresh measures on reform next week and his country's opening up while attending the high-profile Boao Forum, China's equivalent of Davos, in the southern island province of Hainan.
So far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737.
Among the most affected by a trade war could be the U.S. technology sector, particularly chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor sector relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue.
It also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic backlash in terms of travel. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in-South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China. 
On Chinese social media on Friday, among the most searched phrases were ""China hasn't grown up afraid"" and ""China will follow through to the end.""
The China Chamber of International Commerce said the Chinese business community would firmly support its government's efforts to counter ""irrational and erroneous"" U.S. words and actions, the official Xinhua news agency reported, and urged Washington not to go ""further and further down the wrong path.""
DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES
Analysts at Oxford Economics, referring to the fact that the tariffs announced this week are not yet in effect, said in a note to clients that, ""Importantly, these threatened tariffs will be subject to negotiation, and therefore shouldn't be considered as final."" 
However it added a full-blown trade war ""would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and China would suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth – a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point."" It cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford's baseline scenario.
The escalating trade tit-for-tat between the United States and China has roiled global financial markets, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold.
""This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start,"" said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay.

""We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,"" Shay added in a statement, urging Trump ""to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy.""

139,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>","As Australia regulators target broker fees, banks' mortgage business face risk","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's regulators criticized compensation methods used by lenders to win mortgage business in submissions to a powerful inquiry into financial sector misconduct, potentially leading to changes that could disrupt a major revenue source for the banks.
In documents lodged with the judicial inquiry on Thursday, Australia's banking and corporate regulators said remuneration structures used to reward mortgage brokers for recommending bank products are inherently risky and weaken lending standards.
They took aim at the commissions banks use to reward brokers who recommend their products. So-called trailing commissions rise in line with the size of the loan and are paid over the life of the product, which can be decades.
Any change to the commission structure, which the inquiry may ultimately recommend, would upend how banks attract customers through their vast financial planning and broker networks, potentially disrupting one of their best performing businesses - mortgages.
""A ban on commissions is likely to have a serious impact on the mortgage broker market,"" said Azib Khan, a Morgans banking analyst. If the mortgage broker market suffers, the banks, who rely on these networks to source about half of their loans, would instead have to invest in growing their own proprietary networks, Khan added. 
The four biggest banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) - derived revenues of A$51.77 billion ($39.8 billion) from mortgage agents in the September quarter of 2017, according to the inquiry.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said in its submission a flat fee would help avoid conflicts of interest for the brokers because they would no longer have an incentive to recommend a bigger loan than the customer needed. It would also make it easier to compare fees, it said.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said the banks' reluctance to voluntarily improve lending standards and change their sales incentives had ""all led to APRA needing to be more interventionist in its approach to supervision of mortgage lending than it would ordinarily be"". 
The submissions were made in response to the first set of findings of a year-long inquiry that found trailing fees created an incentive for brokers to recommend larger loans for longer periods of time.
Trailing commissions have been prevalent in financial sector products of some countries, though their potential for conflicts of interest has been recognized.
In the Netherlands, where the banking system is similar to Australia's albeit with some differences in the way home loans are sold, broker commissions were banned in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. There, flat fees are paid directly to the brokers by the consumer.
Under questioning by the Royal Commission, as the Australian inquiry is called, CBA and NAB executives conceded that despite the known conflicts, nothing had been done to unwind the broker commission system because the banks would lose market share to rivals if they changed practices first.
NAB and Westpac argued in submissions on Thursday that the upfront and trailing commissions don't lead to ""poor customer outcomes"". CBA said there was ""merit"" in banning volume-based commissions. 
The Royal Commission has extensive powers to subpoena documents and can recommend criminal or civil prosecutions and legislative changes.

European shares followed their Asian counterparts into the red but the falls were limited, and the broader ups and downs for markets this week suggest investors are not yet convinced the row will escalate into a full-blown trade war that threatens global economic growth.

The MSCI World Index slipped 0.08 percent, although it had erased most of its earlier losses as markets calmed in European trading. S&P 500 E-mini futures cut their losses to 0.6 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street when it opens.
In Trump's latest salvo, he said late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. Beijing warned it would fight back ""at any cost"" with fresh measures to safeguard its interests.
""Any escalation in the trade war rhetoric would be more negative for China than the U.S. given the former's relative dependency on trade but for now, the markets are focused on the payrolls data,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due at 1230 GMT, could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and the dollar's direction.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell is also speaking later on Friday and investors will be looking for any signs that rates could rise more than an expected two further hikes this year. The Fed raised rates last month.
The U.S. March employment report is expected to show non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 the prior month, according to the latest Thomson Reuters poll of economists.
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. The gain would lift the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February.
DOLLAR ON HOLD
The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies with traders reluctant to take big positions ahead of the payrolls numbers. 
Against the yen, which as a safe haven currency tends to be among the most sensitive to global economic uncertainty, the dollar was flat. So far this week the dollar is almost 1 percent versus the Japanese currency, hitting its best level since late February, despite the growing U.S.-China trade tensions. 
Some Asian currencies showed signs of investor nervousness, however. 
The Chinese yuan fell another 0.4 percent versus the dollar, bringing week-to-date losses to 0.8 percent. The Korean won, heavily exposed to global trade, also fell.
""The rising tide of economic nationalism is likely to be a motivating theme in markets for the foreseeable future. There is scope for behind-the-scenes pragmatism while sabres get rattled in public, and that is probably the most likely outcome. But the fact is when sabres get rattled, blood sometimes gets spilled,"" said Joseph Amato, CIO of equities at Neuberger Berman.
Treasury debt prices gained and yields declined as investors sought the safety of government bonds. Euro zone government bond yields also dipped as the trade dispute between the United States and China flared. 
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell marginally to 2.8247 percent, pulling back from Thursday's nine-day high of 2.838 percent. Treasury yields had fallen further in Asian trading but the European open calmed investors.
The yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, slid 1 basis points in early trade to a shade above 0.51 percent.
Crude oil prices fell after Trump's latest tariff proposal. O/R U.S. crude slipped 0.44 percent to $63.26 a barrel and Brent was down 0.38 percent at $68.07 a barrel.
Gold prices were steady.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer expressed support following Trump’s comments and called his response “appropriate”.
The news came after China announced on Wednesday that it would introduce tariffs on 106 U.S. products including soybeans, cars and whiskey.
Overnight, the S&P 500 gained 0.7%, the Dow added 1.0% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.5%.

Japan’s Nikkei was little changed by 1:45AM ET (05:45 GMT), gaining 0.01% to 21,650.50. The proposed new tariffs on China created a bearish economic outlook that again sent the safe-haven yen higher this week, which was cited as headwind for local equities earlier in the day.
The country’s top government spokesman Suga’s comments garnered some attention as he said it is important for China and the U.S. to build a relationship for the sake of growth and development of the global economy.
Meanwhile, Data showed on Friday that the country’s household spending fell 0.9% in February, the biggest annual decline in nearly a year. Analysts previously forecast a 0.3% gain. 7-Eleven caught some attention after its owner said he forecast a $3.9 billion full year profit.

The Washington, D.C.-based multilateral lender received a mandate to study the creation of such a fund at its annual meeting late last month in Mendoza, Argentina, Moreno said in a telephone interview. It would serve as a form of insurance for investors in private and public projects in the region.
""We have to look for ways to mobilize many more resources,"" he said. ""One of these methods that we discussed - and that we could say had almost unanimous backing from all the shareholders - is that we study the possibility of making a guarantee fund.""
Many infrastructure projects around the region are on hold and struggling to find financing due to investor concern about corruption scandals related to Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying bribes to win public works contracts in many countries.
In the final moments of the meeting on March 25, delegates from the United States - which is the bank's largest shareholder and controls around a third of its votes - and several European countries said they were not prepared to support a proposal to ""better leverage the financing available in the markets."" 
On Thursday, Moreno declined to provide details on how much money the fund would include or when it may launch. He said none of the bank's member countries had expressed opposition to allowing the private sector to play a larger role in financing projects.
""In general, these institutions can help achieve the process of achieving sustainable development goals,"" he said, referring to the private sector.
Moreno said the IDB has a loan portfolio of $18 billion for the region this year, including $13 billion in loans from the bank to governments around the region and $5 billion from IDB Invest, its private sector arm.
That exceeds the $14.6 billion the bank disbursed throughout Latin America last year.

In the context of trade disputes between the United States and China, it is more urgent ""than ever"" that Latin America accelerate regional integration, he said, adding that the Summit of the Americas in Lima next week is an opportunity to discuss converging various countries' norms and regulations.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2018 02:24AM ET</span>",South Korean prosecutors raid Samsung Elec over alleged union sabotage,"By Ju-min Park and Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors searched offices at a  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) unit on Friday as part of a probe into allegations the conglomerate had sabotaged workers' efforts to strengthen labor unions, the prosecutors' office said.
The tech giant has often come under fire from politicians and civics groups for not engaging with organized labor and its existing unions tend to be small and weak.
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors office told reporters in a brief text message that it raided Samsung's repair service unit outside Seoul.
""I think the administration is trying to put a brake on Samsung's no-union policy, which labor has long criticized,"" said Kim Tai-gi, an economics professor at Dankook University, referring to the labor-friendly government of President Moon Jae-in.
Samsung Group, the country's top family-run business empire, has come under greater scrutiny since heir apparent Jay Y. Lee received a suspended jail term in February for bribing a former president. 
""Samsung was already cornered in the wake of Jay Y. Lee's case. It does not seem easy for Samsung to stick to the existing stance on unions,"" Kim said. 
During a bribery probe involving another former president earlier this year, investigators found thousands of documents suggesting the conglomerate had developed union-busting strategies, domestic media outlets reported.
A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company was aware that prosecutors had secured labor-related documents. She declined to comment further on the probe and had no immediate comment on whether a raid had taken place at the unit which carries out repairs for Samsung Electronics products.
Prosecutors investigated similar accusations after a lawmaker disclosed a document in 2013 that she claimed contained Samsung's guidelines on how to stop its employees from organizing unions.

However, the case was dropped as prosecutors could not verify the source of the document.

The meeting would take place in Europe as part of Hyundai Mobis' investor conference sponsored by Citi, one of the two sources familiar with the matter said, without providing more details on what would be discussed or who would attend. 
A Hyundai Mobis spokesman declined to comment. 
Auto-to-steel giant Hyundai Motor Group announced a plan last week to streamline its complex ownership structure as it responds to calls from the government and investors for greater transparency and better governance at family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols.
Elliott Management revealed on Wednesday that it held more than $1 billion worth of shares in three Group affiliates, including auto parts-maker Hyundai Mobis which would become Hyundai's de facto holding company under the restructuring plan.
The plan, which requires approval from two-thirds of shares that are voted, has been criticized by some investors for stripping Mobis of valuable assets and favoring the controlling Chung family at the expense of shareholders. Questions about synergies arising from the deal also have been raised. 
Shareholder activism is rare in South Korea but the chaebols are under mounting pressure to reform after a corruption scandal last year led to the jailing of Samsung (KS:005930) Group's heir apparent and the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.
South Korean brokerage NH Investment & Securities (KS:005940) said it is advising Hyundai on the reorganization plan.

148,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>",Nissan Eyes Bigger East African Market With Kenyan Vehicle Plant,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. plans to start assembling vehicles in Kenya, bolstering government plans to develop a regional auto-manufacturing hub in East Africa’s biggest economy.
The Japanese automaker is the latest to target Kenya after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, PSA Peugeot and CNH Industrial NV announced plans for assembly lines in the past 18 months. The facilities could cut new-vehicle costs to customers in some of the continent’s fastest-growing economies, where vehicle ownership per thousand people is about a quarter of the global average.
Outside of South Africa, there isn’t much automotive manufacturing on the continent because of challenges such as the volume of imported used cars, few vehicle-financing options and a patchy road network.
Nissan will initially put together pick-up trucks from semi-knocked down kits, or SKDs, if the government agrees to waive a 25 percent import tax, according to Jim Dando, director of Africa operations for Nissan.
“We’re prepared to enter Kenya as an SKD assembler,” Dando said by phone from South Africa’s capital, Pretoria. “We’re keen to move quite fast. We want to make this happen.”
Half-Finished Vehicles
Volkswagen, which returned to Kenya last year after a four-decade absence, is producing its Polo Vivo model from SKD kits.
Nissan will submit a proposal to the government once market studies and due diligence assessments are complete, and may have an operational assembly line by the end of 2019 if it receives a green light. The company would work at an established plant, which would cost it about $20 million, rather than setting up its own facility, Dando said.
Investing in an existing plant for completely knocked-down kits, or CKD, would require as much as $100 million while a new factory would cost double that amount. Nissan prefers starting with half-finished vehicles as it builds market share and a skilled workforce, Dando said.
Nissan executives are considering processing their vehicles at plants owned by Isuzu East Africa Ltd., Associated Vehicle Assemblers Ltd., which belongs to Simba Corp., and Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers, a venture between the government, Toyota Tsusho Corp. and Al-Futtaim Group, Dando said.
Once established, the Kenyan facility will feed the Eastern Africa market, which is currently served by imports of light trucks from South Africa with other models coming from Japan. In addition to its plant in South Africa, Nissan has an assembly line in Nigeria.
One-Ton Trucks
The decision to begin assembling 1-ton pick-up vehicles is because Kenya’s new-vehicle market is dominated by light commercial trucks. One-ton single-cab trucks made up almost 12 percent of all new purchases in Kenya last year, according to the Kenya Motor Industry Association.
While there’s great potential in the passenger-vehicle category the segment is inundated with cheaper second-hand imports, Dando said. Public-transport vehicles in Kenya are colloquially known as Nissan no matter their make, as the first imports of the privately owned minibuses in the early 1990s were usually used models from Japan.
Nissan is also “looking cautiously” at Zimbabwe and Ethiopia as potential countries for local assembly, but has no timelines and is yet to make decisions on those markets. Many African economies have hit a rough patch, making them unattractive as manufacturing bases, Dando said.
“There isn’t much scope in Africa to start an assembly plant” in addition to those it already has beyond Kenya currently, he said.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 08:33PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. willing to talk trade with China, no session set yet - official","By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is willing to negotiate with China on trade, but only if talks are serious, as previous attempts produced little progress, a senior U.S. official told Reuters late on Thursday as trade tensions between the two nations escalated.
No formal negotiating sessions have been set, the official said. ""There is ongoing communications with the Chinese on trade,"" said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the Trump administration's trade strategy. 
The official said Republican President Donald Trump, who has already sought $50 billion in new tariffs on China, will insist on ""verifiable, enforceable and measurable deliverables"" from China in any trade negotiations.
The comments came as Trump said late on Thursday he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China ""in light of China's unfair retaliation"" against earlier U.S. trade actions.
In a statement, Trump said the U.S. Trade Representative had determined that China ""has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property.""
The senior official said: “We’ve had a type of negotiation in different forums where China has made lots of different commitments that they haven’t followed through on.
""We don’t want to go down that path. But the president has been clear, the administration has been clear, we’re not trying to start a trade war. We’re simply trying to get fair and reciprocal treatments so we’re open to those conversations.”
The official said China had committed seven times to stopping forced technology transfers, a practice in which China allegedly seeks to obtain U.S. intellectual property (IP) through joint venture requirements, something that China denies.
""This president is not going to tolerate hollow commitments or refusal to change bad practices. And if the way that we effectuate that is through negotiations, that’s great,"" the official said.
The Trump administration on Tuesday targeted 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing's IP, sending world financial markets gyrating.
China retaliated the next day with a list of duties on U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.

Both firms provided copies to Reuters of their reports containing the proxy recommendations.
GE in January disclosed that U.S. securities regulators were probing insurance charges including a $6.2 billion charge to increase insurance reserves and $15 billion more in provisions for insurance policies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AQR Capital Management, LLC, led by widely regarded hedge fund manager Clifford Asness, announced the launch on Thursday of its first quantitative bond fund, with the aim of capturing different sources of returns.
AQR, which oversees $224 billion in assets, said its Core Plus Bond Fund ""systematically implements fundamental drivers of returns such as value, momentum, carry and defensive themes."" 
The fund seeks to consistently outperform its benchmark, the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Aggregate Index, and generate excess returns that are uncorrelated to fixed-income markets, other fixed-income managers or equity markets.
""The problem is that any perceived alpha (generated by traditional fixed-income managers) has been, at least to a great degree, due to a passive long-term overweight of (corporate) credit,"" wrote Asness in a research report. 
""If we found equity managers outperformed largely because they were strategically, not tactically, higher beta than their benchmarks, would you get excited and pay a lot for that? I hope not.""
The AQR fund is invested in a portfolio of liquid instruments, balanced across the fixed-income universe. The fund aims to generate returns through security selection within sectors, curve positioning, and currency selection, with minimal active duration or credit bets. It strives to maintain a risk level consistent with its benchmark. 
""We do find, again much like in equities, expensive traditional active fixed income management is a bust; however, the same factors we find effective elsewhere (value, momentum, carry, defensive/quality) show up in bonds,"" Asness wrote. 
""So, not surprisingly, we think there is hope, but it’s not because 'active management works in bonds,' but because 'the same basic things that work everywhere also work in bonds.' Basically, don’t go traditional 'active' in fixed income, go factor (and make sure the fees fit that!)."" 
AQR relies mostly on a roomful of powerful computers running proprietary models to evaluate reams of publicly available data. Asness and his partners were among the first to build a stock portfolio by using computer models to combine two simple concepts: buying undervalued stocks (a strategy known as value investing) and betting against overvalued ones (which are called ""momentum"" stocks.
Momentum refers to the tendency of securities that are rising in price to keep going up for a time, even when they are overvalued. 
While AQR has invested in fixed income for over 19 years in its multi-strategy products, this is the first time its expertise has been made available through a standalone fixed income mutual fund.

The department has sued to block AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, saying the deal could raise prices for pay-TV rivals and subscribers while hampering the development of online video.
In a hearing before U.S. Judge Richard Leon, Justice Department attorney Julie Elmer cited an email and report in which Gregory Manty, a director of corporate strategy for AT&T, indicated that buying Time Warner's content would allow AT&T to slow the decline of pay TV, which was described as a ""cash cow.""
Elmer pushed Manty to agree that the report had been ""sanitized,"" noting that some phrases were removed by AT&T executives or outside counsel.
""I wouldn't use the word 'sanitized,'"" Manty said, noting that the powerpoint deck had been used in discussions with Time Warner about potential integration.
Companies are limited by law in what they can discuss publicly before closing a merger. Breaking those rules can cause companies to face accusations of ""gun jumping.""
""It's highly regulated,"" Manty said under cross examination. ""That's why it's overseen by lawyers.""

The trial, which began in mid-March in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Several hedge funds who trace their ancestry to billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management are boasting positive returns for the year even as tumbling markets have left many rivals with losses.
In the first three months of 2018, Glen Kacher's Light Street Capital gained 11.8 percent while Chase Coleman's Tiger Global rose 6.7 percent and Jonathan Auerbach's Hound Partners was up nearly 1 percent, investors in the funds said.
Light Street gained 1.9 percent in March, an investor said. Tiger Global lost 2.4 percent and Hound slipped 1.1 percent last month, the investors said.
That compares with a loss for the S&P 500 stock index of 2.7 percent for March and a loss of 1.2 percent for the first three months of the year. The average global hedge fund has lost 1.03 percent since January, data from Hedge Fund Research show. 
Representatives for the funds either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment. 
Part of the reason Light Street has been performing well this year is the firm's ability to successfully bet against companies whose business models are vulnerable, one investor said. Tiger Global wrote to investors earlier this year that it was committed to short selling, adding ""there will be a period when our hard work pays dividends."" 
Hedge funds have historically billed themselves as being able to make money in all markets by betting against stocks that are duds, but investors say many managers have not had to practice those skills sufficiently as markets raced higher.
Light Street's 2018 gains follow on the heels of a 38.6 percent rise last year, which was generated, in part, through successful short bets. 
Last week the $1.2 billion Menlo Park-based firm stopped taking in money from new investors as it tries to limit its size. It has commitments to grow to roughly $1.5 billion, a person familiar with the firm said.
One of Light Street's biggest winners this year has been Brazil-based payment services company PagSeguro Digital which went public earlier this year and has returned 30 percent since then. German online food delivery service Delivery Hero and Japanese payment processing company GMO Payment Gateway Inc also contributed gains this year.
All funds trace their professional roots to Julian Robertson and his Tiger Management, once one of the world's most successful hedge funds with $22 billion in assets at its peak before it shut down in 2000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors pulled back from the stock market for a third straight week, withdrawing $11.6 billion in cash in the week ended Wednesday, in the face of a potential full-blown trade war between the United States and China, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
The markets have rocked back and forth over the past week on shifting sentiments of the likelihood of an all-out trade war. China retaliated on Wednesday against planned U.S. tariffs by targeting key U.S. products, though the United States later voiced willingness to negotiate a resolution.
""It makes sense that there's money flowing out of equities with everything we were seeing in the market,"" said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. ""The market is kind of deciding what to do right now so I think it is going to be this way for a bit before it settles down.""
Late on Thursday, President Donald Trump said that he instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China after the country's state media said it would win any trade war.
Major companies start to report quarterly earnings this month, with investors expecting strong profit growth. Wall Street analysts expect first-quarter S&P 500 profits to rise by 18 percent over the year before, helped by the tax cuts passed in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
International stock funds remain a relative bright spot, with emerging markets-focused funds taking in $636 million during the week and continuing an unbroken streak of weekly inflows this year, Lipper said.
Taxable bond funds attracted $3.5 billion during the week ended Wednesday, Lipper data showed. Treasury funds took in $3.1 billion, the most since January 2016.

The company also said Mignini would continue to head its global biscuits and snacks businesses under the newly-created position.
Under Mignini, the biscuits and snacks unit, which makes Pepperidge Farm cookies and Arnott's biscuits, has recorded steady growth, accounting for nearly a third of the company's total sales. 
The reorganization follows Campbell's recent acquisition of Cape Cod chips maker Snyder's-Lance Inc for about $5 billion to help expand its snacking business and counter slowing soup sales.
""Snyder's-Lance acquisition served as a catalyst for us to re-examine how to best organize the company for increased emphasis on execution and profitable growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison said in a statement. 
The company also said it had created a new accelerator unit to drive growth in its faster-growing business, including Campbell Fresh, which will led by Ana Dominguez who was previously president of Campbell Canada.

The soup maker's shares were up 0.6 percent at $43.48 in extended trading.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Banks facing losses on American Greetings buyout debt,"By Andrew Berlin
NEW YORK (LPC) - Nine banks are facing losses on a fully underwritten US$1.02bn loan and bond financing backing the buyout of US greeting cards and stationery maker American Greetings by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) after a weak response from investors, three sources familiar with the matter said. 
The debt includes a Barclays-led term loan B that has been upsized to US$470m from US$445m and a Deutsche Bank-led unsecured bond that has been downsized to US$300m from US$325m, as well as a US$250m five-year revolving credit facility, which will be undrawn at close. 
Proceeds will be used to partly finance CD&R’s purchase of a 60% stake in American Greetings in a deal that values the company at US$1.1bn, including debt and transaction fees. 
The deal struggled to gain momentum in syndication after investors shied away from buying debt in a company facing uncertainty, sources said.
Guidance on the term loan opened at 375bp over Libor with a 1% floor and a 99.5 original issue discount (OID), implying a yield to three-year call of roughly 6.24%, based on current three-month Libor rates, sources said. 
Commitments were due on March 29, but the loan was not expected to clear until the bond pricing was set, as lenders looked to the bond for relative value. 
The bond is expected to price on Thursday, after underwriters’ discussions with CD&R about potential changes to the capital structure resulted in the US$25m shift of funds from the bond to the loan and a change to the maturity profile of the debt.   
CD&R is contributing US$204m of preferred equity to the buyout, representing roughly 18% of capitalization. Including rollover amounts from the founding Weiss family, which will retain a 40% stake, the equity capitalization is roughly 31%. 
Pricing on the US$470m term loan has widened to 450bp over Libor with a 1% floor and 98 OID, implying a yield to three-year call of roughly 7.5%, the sources said. In addition to the upsize, the maturity of the loan has been reduced to six years from seven originally. At those terms, the banks will remain within their market flex, earning in full the fees agreed to for underwriting the loan, two of the sources said. Commitments are due on Thursday. 
The banks have also received full fees on the revolver, one of the sources added. 
However, official price talk on the US$300m bond circulated on Thursday at an 8.75% coupon with an 85 OID, for an all-in yield of 12%, sources said. This is 100bp wider than price whispers at a 10.5%-11% all-in yield mid-week and 300bp wider than whispers at an 8.5%-9% all-in yield on Monday. In addition to the downsize, the bond’s maturity has been shortened to seven years from eight originally, alongside certain covenant changes around additional debt incurrence, removing cash from the company and investments. 
The underwriters would break even on the entire financing if the bond priced with an 8.75% coupon and an OID of 91, two of the sources said. 
At the proposed OID, the underwriting syndicate will take a loss of around US$18m, they said.
EBITDA PRESSURE 
The financing puts American Greetings’ debt-to-Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, at roughly 2.1 times through the term loan, up from 2.0 times before the upsize, and 3.5 times total debt, according to another source close to the matter. 
While this is below regulators' six times total debt-to-Ebitda cap, investors are concerned about the company’s ability to support this level of debt if the new owners fail to stabilize Ebitda. 
Ebitda has fallen by around 20% since 2015, but CD&R’s projections suggest that the transaction will deliver more than US$75m of cost savings, representing more than 30% of last 12-months’ Ebitda, a fourth source said. 
In addition to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), the underwriters include Citizens Bank, ING, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), HSBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, KeyBank and CIBC. Deutsche Bank, Citizens Bank, ING, BAML and KeyBank declined to comment. HSBC, SMBC, CIBC and CD&R did not respond to requests for comment. 
The size of the bond could change slightly as it is linked to the final participation rate by the company’s existing bondholders in a change-of-control tender offer for its outstanding US$400m bond due in 2025.
While roughly 94% of existing bondholders have tendered, underwriters expect 100% participation. Any holdouts would likely see their bonds, which carry a 7.875% coupon and most recently traded at 103 to yield 7.148%, trade down to a level providing a comparable yield to the new bond.

169,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, April 6.
1. It's Jobs Friday
Amid easing trade-war fears, investors are likely look to nonfarm payrolls data due 08:30 am ET – arguably one of the most important economic events of the month – for market direction. 
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to show 193,000 jobs were created in March.
Economists forecast the jobless rate to decline to 4% while average hourly earnings for March is expected to jump to 0.3% from 0.1% in the previous month.
The Federal Reserve’s most recent summary of economic projections released in March showed Fed policymakers anticipate unemployment will drop to 3.8% by year end.
Investors will assess the nonfarm payrolls report for clues about the strength of the economy which could provide fresh direction for the dollar, bond yields, and the US stock market.
The previous jobs report in February  was mixed as an above 300,000 gain in jobs was offset somewhat by a fall in average hourly earnings.
2. Power of Powell in Focus
Investors eagerly await Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s appearance at 1:30 p.m. ET Friday, when the Fed chief is expected to address the U.S. economic outlook and provide his perspective on the March employment report.
In the run up to Powell’s speech, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that there was a risk of the Federal Reserve adopting a faster pace of monetary policy tightening to curb rising inflation.
Yet, Powell is expected to keep to the Fed’s tried and tested narrative of “gradual” rate hikes as it was only a little over two weeks ago that he told reporters there was no sense in the data that the U.S. is “on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.”
Powell is unlikely, however, to be drawn into a discussion on U.S.-China trade tensions, which have since eased, amid expectations that the two nations would reach a compromise on trade.
Ahead of Powell's speech, former Fed chair Janet Yellen reportedly said she considered inflation to be in check, so expects rates to stay relatively low.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count Data to Signal Further US Output Tightening?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs fell for the first time in three weeks.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures struggled for direction on Thursday but ultimately settled higher despite retreating from session highs as investors weighed signs of rising crude supplies against improving sentiment on riskier assets.
Energy provider Genscape said crude stockpiles at the cushing storage hub in Oklahoma rose to 2.5 million barrels for the week to April 3, according to traders who saw the data.
That eased earlier investor optimism somewhat which followed renewed appetite for riskier assets after the US indicated a willingness to hash out a trade deal with China."
170,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","Texas oil output surge clogs pipelines, depresses prices","By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Permian basin in Texas is leading the way as U.S. oil production has reached an all-time high, but the prolific output is causing bottlenecks as pipelines transporting the crude have filled up more quickly than expected. 
That has depressed prices there, posing a threat to future production, while providing a boost to pipeline companies as the lines have filled to near-capacity.
With few new pipeline projects scheduled for this year, producers may be forced to slow drilling, or even shut in active production. 
The problem illustrates the snags that can arise in transporting crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast as oil prices have rebounded to more than $60 a barrel and companies have reduced costs to make drilling more profitable in the Permian. 
Production there is estimated to have hit a record 3.08 million bpd in March, nearly a third of overall U.S. production of 10.4 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Permian drillers are branching out into relatively less-profitable areas of the region, said John Zanner, energy analyst for RBN Energy.
""As these fringe areas begin to get exploited, we are seeing more and more crude that needs to find a pipeline to Cushing or the Gulf Coast,"" he said.
Most analysts estimated pipelines out of the Permian would fill completely by mid-2018, but this may already be happening. According to market intelligence firm Genscape, pipeline utilization from the Permian to the Gulf Coast averaged about 89 percent this year and 96 percent in the last four weeks.
U.S. crude for delivery in Midland, Texas  traded at $5.50/barrel under the price of benchmark futures on Wednesday, weakest since October 2014. West Texas Sour , the sour grade delivered into Midland, traded as much as $6.25 a barrel below futures. 
Midland light sweet crude currently trades at more than $8 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate at East Houston, a key delivery spot for export markets - the biggest discount on record.
(GRAPHIC: Texas oil output surge - https://reut.rs/2EmL4nN) 
""What the spreads are telling you is that these pipelines are full going to the Gulf Coast,"" said Kendrick Rhea at energy consultancy East Daley Capital.
The wide spreads mean pipeline operators are now seeing a surge in demand and throughput, traders and analysts said.
Spreads have even widened enough to cover spot shipping rates, which are typically higher than long-term committed rates offered by pipeline companies. 
For midstream companies, this could show up in earnings reports for several quarters. Analysts' revenue projections for Permian pipeline companies  Enterprise Products Partners LP  (N:EPD), Energy Transfer Partners LP (N:ETP) and  Plains All American Pipeline  LP (N:PAA) have been revised higher over the last 90 days, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
All three rank in the top 10 percent in terms of upward revisions for North American companies in the Thomson Reuters universe, and the same model projects all three will exceed revenue projections in the first quarter.
""They're going to see record flows coming out, they're going to see record margins on marketing and on walk-up tariffs for the rest of the year,"" Rhea said.
As of March 2018, the Permian had a total of 3.175 million bpd of outgoing pipeline, rail and local refining capacity, according to Genscape, of which outgoing pipeline capacity accounts for 2.725 million bpd. 
The next boost will be the expansion of Permian Express 3, which will add 200 million barrels of daily capacity in late 2018. The Enterprise Midland-to-Sealy line could also expand capacity to bring it to 450,000 bpd from 330,000 bpd late last year.

By mid-to-late 2019, projects including the Cactus Pipeline 2 and EPIC lines will add more than 1.5 million bpd of additional capacity.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:45PM ET</span>","As S&P 500 recovers, most components remain in correction - or worse","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As a stock rebound on Thursday put the S&P 500 on track for its strongest three-day performance since 2016, a look at the recent performance of most of the index's components paints a different picture, illustrating signs of weakness in Wall Street's health.
Cooling fears that Trump is starting a trade war with China helped the S&P 500 rebound 0.8 percent on Thursday and 2.9 percent over the past three sessions. But the S&P 500's (SPX) recent volatility has left the index trading down 7 percent from its record high on Jan 26, and most of its components have fallen even further from their own recent highs as investors worry about high valuations and likely interest rate hikes. 
Nearly 18 percent of S&P 500 components have fallen 20 percent or more from their own one-year highs, according to Thomson Reuters data, putting them in bear-market territory. Another 41 percent of S&P 500 stocks are down between 10 and 20 percent from their year highs, a range that investor consider correction territory.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 Bears - https://reut.rs/2JnINfK) 
Within the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI),  General Electric  (N:GE) has slumped 56 percent from its year high in April 2017, while Walmart (N:WMT) is down 20 percent from its year high in January. Another 12 of the Dow's 30 components have declined between 10 and 20 percent from their year highs.
(GRAPHIC: Dow Bears - https://reut.rs/2JnINwg) 
The two largest U.S. companies by stock market value weathered Wall Street's recent volatility better than most, helping limit the S&P 500's loss in 2018 to under 1 percent. Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) are down 2.6 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively since the end of February, better than the S&P 500's 6 percent loss in that time. The two technology behemoths are down about 5 percent each from their own previous record highs.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) has fallen 5 percent in the past month but remains up 24 percent year to date, as investors continue to bet the online retailer and cloud computing behemoth will expand further into food retail and other markets.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Pratt & Whitney wins JetBlue engine order,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airline JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) said on Thursday it has awarded Pratt & Whitney a contract to supply engines for its total fleet of 85 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo aircraft, more than doubling the carrier's previous contract with the engine maker.
Pratt & Whitney is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp (N:UTX). Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The new agreement adds 45 aircraft to an earlier arrangement under which Pratt agreed to supply JetBlue with engines for 40 twin-engine jets. The deal also includes 13 spare engines and maintenance of the products. 
""Number one was making sure that we had the right engine with the right technology for the future of JetBlue,"" JetBlue Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest said in an interview on Thursday.
Pratt beat out rival  General Electric  (N:GE) for the order, in a boost to the manufacturer after earlier issues with the engine.
Some Pratt A320neo deliveries were halted after problems arose in January, which Pratt had said stemmed from an engineering change it made last summer to the ""knife-edge seal"" in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine.
""There have been some teething issues with the engines that have been well-publicized, but the one thing I will say: the trust that we have with Pratt is fantastic. They have been incredibly transparent about what those issues have been,"" Priest said.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Vivendi presents board candidates for Telecom Italia in bid to please investors,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) presented a new list of candidates for the board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) on Thursday in a bid to alleviate concerns raised by activist fund Elliott Advisors on the governance of the group. 
The list of ten candidates is led by Telecom Italia's boss Amos Genish and includes his counterpart at Vivendi, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who is proposed as non-executive chairman. 
Vivendi released the list for the general meeting on May 4.
This follows the sudden resignation of TIM's former board on March 22. That move was widely perceived as pre-empting Elliott's bid to change the way Vivendi, TIM's top shareholder with a stake of close to 24 percent, runs the company.
""In putting forward this list, we have listened carefully to the views of shareholders and other key stakeholders,"" de Puyfontaine said in a written statement. 
""We have made changes to strengthen the technical competence of the Board as well as drawing on a wider range of expertise and opinions."" 
Vivendi has built up its stake in TIM since 2015, progressively tightening its grip on the group. It appointed two-thirds of the Italian phone group's board last year.
The hands-on approach of the media giant, itself controlled and led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, has fueled tensions with the Italian government.
Rome, which considers TIM of strategic national importance, eventually used its so-called ""golden power"" to ensure it had a say in some strategic decisions at TIM.
Elliott has built a potential holding of 5.7 percent in TIM and made its demands public last month. 

Italian state lender CDP confirmed late on Thursday that it would buy up to 5 percent of TIM, in a move intended to safeguard Rome’s interest the group.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:04PM ET</span>","Target settles claims it screened blacks, Hispanics out of jobs","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) has agreed to review its policies for screening job applicants and pay $3.74 million to settle a lawsuit claiming its use of criminal background checks kept thousands of blacks and Hispanics from obtaining employment.
The preliminary settlement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requires a judge's approval.
It resolves claims that Target, which has performed background checks for employment in U.S. stores since 2001, ""imported the racial and ethnic disparities"" in U.S. criminal justice system into its hiring, in part by disqualifying job applicants for convictions unrelated to the work they sought.
The Minneapolis-based retailer was accused of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on race, gender and other characteristics.
Thursday's settlement calls for experts to review Target's guidelines for using criminal histories in hiring, and help the retailer implement appropriate changes.
Eligible blacks and Hispanics who were since May 2006 wrongly denied hourly and entry-level jobs such as cashiers, cart attendants, food service workers and stockers will receive $1.2 million or ""priority hiring.""
Another $600,000 will fund nonprofits that help people with criminal histories reenter the workforce, while most of the remaining payout will cover legal and other fees, the settlement said. Target did not admit wrongdoing.
Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer no longer asks for criminal histories in job applications, but still considers convictions ""important"" and gathers criminal background information late in the hiring process.
""We have a number of measures in place to ensure we're fair and equitable in our hiring,"" while ""maintaining a safe and secure working and shopping environment for team members and guests,"" she said.
The plaintiffs included Carnella Times and Erving Smith, who are black and claimed they were denied stocker jobs after background checks uncovered past convictions, and The Fortune Society, which helps former prisoners reenter society.
That group last year filed a similar discrimination charge against Macy's Inc with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The plaintiffs were represented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (""LDF""), and the law firm Outten & Golden.

""Criminal background information can be a legitimate tool for screening job applicants,"" but Target's background checks were ""harmful to many qualified applicants who deserved a fair shot at a good job,"" LDF President Sherrilyn Ifill said in a statement.

The bank's plans, which could lead to layoffs in the future, will affect some industry coverage groups, advisory teams, equity and debt capital markets origination and certain corporate-banking relationship managers, according to the WSJ report. (https://on.wsj.com/2GV0Prl)
Wells Fargo's corporate bank and investment bank, though not fully merged, will now share profit and loss targets across industry verticals, the Journal said.
The Journal also reported that the bank has told staff of several dozen layoffs as recently as on Wednesday in its markets division, which is part of Wells Fargo's wholesale division along with corporate and investing banking.
Those layoffs affect senior and junior employees in areas including credit sales and trading units and are based on a review of the business and staffing level adjustments, one of the people told WSJ. The layoffs are not directly tied to the corporate bank and investment bank integration, the person said. 

The San Francisco-based bank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The sale, announced on Thursday through a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, comes about a year and a half after HNA bought a 25 percent stake in Hilton for around $6.5 billion to become its biggest shareholder.
Today, HNA owns 26.1 percent of Hilton.
Following a $50 billion investment spree in the past two years, HNA has sold assets such as land and office buildings in recent months to pay down a large pile of debt that is straining its finances. 
In just the first 11 months of last year, HNA's bank loans and bonds surged by more than one-third to 637.5 billion yuan ($101.1 billion), a HNA China bond market filing showed.
HNA had taken out a loan for its Hilton shares as well. A December 2017 SEC filing showed HNA had increased a loan against its Hilton shares to $3.5 billion from $3 billion. The lenders are JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Credit Suisse  AG (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and UBS AG (S:UBSG).
No details were available on when or to whom HNA would sell its Hilton stake, or the size of the divestment. A Hilton spokesman declined to comment.
An October 2016 SEC filing showed there are restrictions on how HNA can sell its Hilton stake if a divestiture happens in the first two years of ownership. Limitations included obtaining the approval of a majority of Hilton's board.
Hilton's shares were up 1 percent at $78.79 in late morning trade.
HNA sold its 25 percent stakes in Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) and  Hilton Grand Vacations Inc  (N:HGV) in March. Both stakes were worth a total of $2.5 billion and were sold in the open market.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 06:56PM ET</span>","BlackRock to offer gun-free investment strategies, ETFs","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said on Thursday it will offer new investment strategies and exchange-traded funds that exclude civilian firearms producers and retailers, following through on plans it outlined last month after a Florida high school massacre.
According to a client update sent by a company spokesman, BlackRock will offer a new line of firearm-free products to big institutional investors and pension plans that track broad market indexes like the S&P 500 and Russell 1000.
BlackRock also said it would create two new ETFs that would exclude gun makers and large gun retailers, and add similar screens to existing stock and bond ETFs that already consider social factors. The changes would bounce retailers from some current ETFs including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc.
Strong investor interest in the products in theory could weaken demand for shares of gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co, where BlackRock funds have large stakes, although it could take awhile for clients to move enough money to make an impact.
BlackRock's action is the latest instance of a business responding to a backlash among many Americans against firearms companies following a series of U.S. mass shootings, although the eventual impact of the company moves remains unclear.
BlackRock has about $6 trillion under management. The firm and rivals have struggled to balance social and environmental issues important to clients with their need to own stocks represented in big worldwide indexes.
BlackRock did not make executives available for interviews including CEO Larry Fink, and did not offer more details about talks it has sought with companies involved with firearms. The gunmakers have defended their safety efforts.
Other firms already offer ETFs with at least some restrictions on gun-related stocks including the Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values ETF.
Still, given the firm's size, BlackRock's new products could prove a significant step as financial firms face pressure to impose limits tighter than current laws act in the wake of the February shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead and renewed a national gun control debate.
On March 22,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) added restrictions on firearms sales for retail clients. 
Other banks and fund managers have said they would speak to clients involved with firearms, but they have not disclosed further actions, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).
BlackRock's new gun-free strategies will track broad indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 1000, Russell 2000 and Russell 3000, and the MSCI World ex-US index, and could appear in company 401(k) plans.
The ETFs getting the new screens have had little exposure to firearms makers, BlackRock said, and already consider social factors in their stockpicking such as the iShares MSCI USA ESG Optimized ETF.
The new screens would bar them from owning retailers with more than $20 million in revenue from gun sales. That would include Walmart and Dick's, although both in February said they would stop selling firearms to people under 21 years old.

BlackRock acknowledged in the client note that it runs money for a diverse set of clients ""who have a wide range of views on firearms.""

200,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Thirteen mutual fund firms to reveal more about active funds: NY AG,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thirteen big mutual fund firms, including BlackRock, T Rowe Price and Vanguard, will soon give retail investors a new tool to assess whether they are getting their money's worth for the higher fees often charged by actively managed stock funds.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Thursday the companies agreed with his office to begin reporting ""Active Share,"" or the percentage of holdings that does not overlap a benchmark index such as the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX), for more than 400 funds.
Schneiderman said the 13 companies already disclosed Active Share data to institutional and professional investors, but left ordinary investors in the dark.
The new disclosures, which begin this quarter, will help ""level the playing field"" by giving retail investors access to ""critical information"" before they invest, he said. Schneiderman encouraged the rest of the fund industry to follow suit.
The 13 companies are joining Fidelity Management & Research in disclosing Active Share to ordinary investors. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, one of the 13, had been doing it most of the time.
Critics of Active Share fear its misuse could prompt portfolio managers to take greater risks, or steer financial advisers and investors into funds unlikely to beat the market.
Index funds have long been gaining market share in the roughly $16.3 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry because of predictable performance and low fees. They are particularly popular in employer-sponsored retirement plans such as 401(k)s.
Even the billionaire Warren Buffett believes many investors are better off with them, saying last May that passively managed funds ""have delivered for shareholders a result that has been better than Wall Street professionals as a whole.""
While active funds can outperform, they labor under an average 0.75 percent annual expense ratio, compared with 0.17 percent for passive funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
Moreover, some active funds closely track their benchmarks, becoming what critics call ""closet"" index funds.
So for example, if a fund owned 1,000 stocks, but 99 percent of its holdings overlapped the S&P 500, then its Active Share would be just 1 percent. Meaningful outperformance would be unlikely.
The investor protection bureau of Schneiderman's office studied fees and disclosures for 2,344 mutual funds.
It even found a handful of funds carrying Active Shares of around 20 percent, or less, but which imposed stiff expense ratios topping 2 percent.

Other fund companies that will disclose Active Share more widely include AllianceBernstein, the American Funds, Columbia Management, Dreyfus, Eaton Vance, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, TIAA-CREF's Nuveen, OppenheimerFunds and USAA.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 02:24PM ET</span>",Investors scope out potential European wins from U.S.-China frictions,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Nobody wins a trade war, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said in March. But for some European companies, a bit of friction couldn't hurt.
European producers of aircraft, telecoms equipment and whisky could stand to benefit if U.S.-China trade tensions allow them to chip away at their American rivals' share of the massive Chinese market. 
Traders and investors have begun looking at which European stocks could reap rewards if the two countries impose tariffs on a long list of each other's goods.
""A trade war is a battle that could create opportunities,"" said Hans Ulrich Jost, European value equities portfolio manager at GAM.
China's tariff list targets U.S. aircraft imports, hurting Boeing (N:BA) and potentially opening the way for European arch-rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to fill the gap. 
Boeing is the main proxy in any trade war plays, according to a trader at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets, who said he had seen some investors short the stock in the past weeks. 
China accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. aircraft exports and all U.S. auto exports, according to UBS.
Boeing's shares were punished on Wednesday but recovered at the close, while Airbus was among the best performers. 
UBS analysts said in a note ""the impact should be marginal for Boeing, with limited upside for Airbus."" Several traders who spoke to Reuters were pushing the ""Buy Airbus vs Boeing"" play. 
(GRAPHIC: April 5 Airbus Boeing - https://reut.rs/2GAsCOv)
SPORTSWEAR AND WHISKY
The consumer sector could also see some rotation of Chinese demand away from big U.S. names and into European brands. German sportswear brand Adidas (DE:ADSGn), for example, could make inroads to the detriment of U.S. rival  Nike  (N:NKE).
Investors emphasized that Nike, which makes most of its products in China, would likely see little price change from the tariffs, however. Any impact would likely come from Chinese consumers actively turning away from U.S. brands.
One portfolio manager said he was short Nike shares as he expected Chinese consumers to shun the brand in favor of European names. 
U.S. companies producing to export to China, like the maker of Jack Daniels whisky in Kentucky (N:BFb), could be more directly impacted.
European drinks makers' shares rose on Wednesday on speculation Chinese demand may switch to European equivalents such as Martell cognac and Chivas Regal whisky, produced by  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), or Remy Martin cognac (PA:RCOP).
(GRAPHIC: Adidas overtakes Nike year to date 2018 - https://reut.rs/2q7pVtF)
Nokia (HE:NOKIA) was singled out by traders and analysts as a likely beneficiary of tariffs drawing more Chinese demand to European mobile equipment makers. Its shares were steady during Wednesday's sell-off and were up 1.9 percent on Thursday.
Europe's biggest export to China is telecommunications equipment, according European statistics office Eurostat. 
Big exporters of industrial machinery, such as ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), could also be relatively favored by higher U.S.-China trade costs because they compete directly with U.S. firms such as Honeywell (N:HON), said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
ABB and Siemens enjoyed strong price gains on Thursday. 
Investors also pointed to European chipmakers such as ASML (AS:ASML) and Infineon  as likely to benefit from China switching away from U.S. semiconductor suppliers. 
Semiconductor stocks, which have led the rally in tech over the past year, are highly liquid and therefore easy for investors to short as a proxy to the trade war theme, the Northern Trust trader said.
""A TAX ON SOUTHERN GERMAN AUTO""
The complicated nature of global supply chains means tariffs on U.S. imports could also negatively impact European companies.
Chinese tariffs on auto imports from the United States, for example, could disproportionately hurt European carmakers which export their products to China from U.S. plants.
""If China passes an incremental 25 percent tax on U.S.-specific auto exports into China (on top of the existing 25 percent tariff for all global auto imports into China), then this is essentially a tax on southern German auto,"" Evercore analysts led by Arndt Ellinghorst said, pointing specifically to BMW and Mercedes SUVs built in America and exported to China.
Asked about the Chinese tariffs,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said it would not speculate about ongoing negotiations.
Companies with manufacturing sites in China could also get hurt.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts pointed to the healthcare sector, where medical technology companies GN Store (CO:GN), Sonova (S:SOON) and Philips (AS:PHG) have big Chinese manufacturing facilities.
They mainly sell their products domestically, elsewhere in Asia and in Europe, however, so the impact would likely be limited, they said in a note.

The company's shares have sunk 16 percent, wiping more than $80 billion from its market value since March 16, when the New York Times and London's Observer newspaper broke news of the use of its data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Some investors see the chaos as a chance to snap up shares in a service for which there is scarce alternative, despite rising public scrutiny and the prospect of a grilling from U.S. legislators when Zuckerberg testifies before Congress next week.
Canada's province of British Columbia and Canada's federal government combined investigations on Thursday, saying they had launched a joint probe into Facebook and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ, while Australian authorities said they were exploring whether the social media company had breached user privacy laws.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, with nearly $1 billion in Facebook stock as of last year, on Thursday also said it would question the company about privacy protections.
Despite the probes and celebrities including singer Cher, actor Will Ferrell and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Elon Musk deleting their accounts, Facebook's social app downloads improved on a monthly basis both in the United States and globally, according to Evercore ISI.
Facebook expanded its share of social app downloads in March by 33.2 percent from 30.1 percent, Evercore data showed.
Several Wall Street analysts said the stock's decline presented a good opportunity to buy into the social network's previously high-flying shares, although they cautioned that much will depend on Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress.
""We suspect that looking back a year from now, if not sooner, this episode will have been a uniquely compelling buying opportunity in the mega-cap internet space,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said.
Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that a few advertisers had paused spending in the wake of the incident, but that the company was having reassuring conversations about how it has built privacy into its system. (https://bloom.bg/2q89KMt)
Companies including U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys, internet company Mozilla and German bank  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) have suspended advertisement on the platform.
Sandberg also said a tool that allowed a researcher to gain access to personal information of up to 87 million users, complied with a privacy agreement the company signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2011.
Her comments followed reports that the FTC was investigating the company over a possible violation of that agreement, which demands it to get user consent before sharing their information. 
""While it's clear that investor sentiment has been materially impacted by (the) Cambridge Analytica revelations, we believe FB is acting proactively and aggressively to tighten its privacy controls and increase the level of transparency into its practices,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Ken Sena said.
Zuckerberg, who will testify about the scandal next week in front of committees in the U.S. House and Senate, may face calls from legislators for more oversight.
Sandberg, in a separate interview with PBS, said: ""We're not just open to regulations, we're moving ahead of it,"" and had built a tool which would be live before the next U.S. election and which would show details of who paid for election ads and demographics of the audience.

Facebook shares closed up 2.7 percent at $159.35.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Peugeot boss says CO2 fines will create Chinese 'Trojan Horse',"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - A major European carmaker could be brought ""to its knees"" by carbon dioxide emissions fines, allowing a Chinese buyer to step in with its own electric vehicle technology, Peugeot maker PSA Group's chief executive said.
Carlos Tavares, who chairs European auto industry lobby group ACEA, said that policymakers had failed to anticipate this outcome of the European Union's 2020 CO2 goals.
""The impact is very obvious. It's going to create a Chinese Trojan Horse in Europe,"" Tavares told an industry event hosted by French car magazine Le Journal de l'Auto late on Wednesday.
His outspoken comments come against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between China and the United States and wider concerns about growing protectionism worldwide.
They also underscore concerns about foreign influence over European manufacturers, jobs and technology, which have risen since China's Geely snapped up 10 percent of Germany's Daimler in February.
""If a European carmaker missed its (CO2) targets and was brought to its knees by fines, it could not be acquired by another big European carmaker purely because of antitrust rules,"" Tavares said, without naming any manufacturer.
That would create the opportunity for a foreign investor to bring in the kind of technology ""imposed by European authorities, which means electric vehicles,"" he said.
""And who's the leader in electrification? It's the Chinese,"" he added.
Paris-based PSA, itself 12.2 percent-owned by China's Dongfeng Motor Corp., has accelerated new vehicle development at Opel and Vauxhall after uncovering what Tavares described as hidden CO2 emissions problems following the brands' acquisition from General Motors (NYSE:GM) last year.
Thanks to the extra investment, the group maintains it is now on track to meet CO2 goals averaging 95 grammes per kilometer being phased in from 2020-2021, backed by hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for non-compliance. The current EU-mandated average for new cars is 130 g/km.
Tavares has called for the EU penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate electric-car charging networks, saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of Brussels-based ACEA on March 7.
""ACEA has not approached the European Commission to reopen any discussion of the 2020 goals,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters.
President Donald Trump's administration moved this week to weaken U.S. fuel-economy goals previously agreed for 2022-25 in response to calls for a revision by carmakers. 

PSA and other European carmakers are facing declining sales of fuel-efficient diesel models, making it harder to meet CO2 targets and avoid large fines.

(Reuters) -  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) on Thursday reported weaker-than-expected earnings for a second straight quarter, saying its corn business dropped as U.S. farmers planted fewer acres this spring, while low crop prices continued to drag the sector.
The world's biggest seed company, in the process of being acquired by Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), missed analysts' quarterly profit estimates. Weakness in the corn business also was due to timing, as a cold spring in the United States delayed seed shipments, said Bernstein senior analyst Jonas Oxgaard.
""It hasn't been a normal spring, and because of that, I think we could see farmers trying to switch some of their corn acres to soybeans, because you plant soybeans a month later,"" Oxgaard said.
Sales in the corn seeds and traits business dropped 6.2 percent to $2.72 billion during the second quarter ended Feb. 28. Soybean business sales rose 6 percent to $912 million, Monsanto said.
The results come the day after China slapped an aggressive 25 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. soybeans, farm country’s most valuable export to China last year.
Monsanto said demand has remained strong for its Intacta brand soybean seeds in South America, Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States. It also reported better pricing of glyphosate, the key ingredient in its weed killer Roundup.
Monsanto said it was ""optimistic"" the Bayer deal would close, and added that the companies have seen ""solid progress.""
Adoption of its latest commercialized biotech soybeans line continues to gain U.S. acreage, with farmers ""on the way to planting nearly 50 million acres of dicamba-tolerant soy and cotton in 2018, nearly double last season’s acreage,"" said Monsanto President Brett Begemann.
If that happens, it would mean Monsanto's dicamba-tolerant seed traits would be on 48 percent of the total soybean and cotton acreage U.S. farmers expect to plant this spring, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.
The company said it expects the number will increase to 60 million acres in 2019.
DEAL ON TRACK
In March, Bayer won EU antitrust approval for its $62.5 billion bid to acquire Monsanto. Monsanto said it ""continues to be confident"" that U.S. and other needed regulatory approvals will be secured in the second quarter of this year.
Net profit attributable to Monsanto rose to $1.46 billion, or $3.27 per share, from $1.37 billion, or $3.09 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the St. Louis, Missouri-based company earned $3.22 per share, missing the average analyst estimate by 8 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net sales fell to $5.02 billion from $5.07 billion.

Monsanto also said it is restarting U.S. farm trials of NemaStrike, a controversial chemical designed to be applied to crop seeds to protect corn, soybeans and cotton from worms that reduce yields. The company said protective measures can prevent farm workers from getting a skin rash that caused objections to the chemical.

S&P 500 e-mini futures  were down 1.4 percent in trading for the overnight session. Dow futures <1YMcv1> were down 1.7 percent.
Trump, in a statement, said he proposed the additional tariffs ""in light of China's unfair retaliation"" against earlier U.S. tariff actions.
""These potential trade wars are not good for the market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""I don't think the market will perceive them as good for the economy, so therefore they're not good for the market. It doesn't surprise me that as the rhetoric heats up that the market is weak.""
During the regular session, the Dow (DJI) and the S&P 500 (SPX) posted gains for a third day in a row, the longest streak in about a month, as investors' worries of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China began to ease.

On Wednesday, Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a ""negotiation"" with China rather than a trade war.

The spin-off is part of a plan by FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne to ""purify"" the Italian-American carmaker's portfolio and to unlock value at Magneti Marelli, which sits within FCA's components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid, and which analysts say could be worth between 3.6 and 5 billion euros ($4.4-6.1 billion).
""The separation will deliver value to FCA shareholders, while providing the operational flexibility necessary for Magneti Marelli's strategic growth in the coming years,"" Marchionne said in a statement.
Magneti Marelli, which employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries, is a diversified components supplier specialized in lighting, powertrain and electronics and its spin-off is part of a five-year business plan FCA is due to present on June 1.
""The spin-off will also allow FCA to further focus on its core portfolio while at the same time improving its capital position,"" Marchionne added.
Marchionne has a long history of such moves. The 65-year-old was behind the spin-off and listing of trucks and tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and supercar brand  Ferrari  (MI:RACE).
The Magneti Marelli separation is expected to be completed by the end of this year or early 2019, with shares in the company expected to be listed on the Milan stock exchange.
FCA's advisers initially looked at a possible initial public offering for the business to raise cash to cut FCA's debt, but the Agnelli family - FCA's main shareholder - were put off by low industry valuations and did not want their stake in Magneti Marelli to be diluted, three sources close to the matter told Reuters last month. 
Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target and FCA has fielded interest from various rivals and private equity firms over the years.
South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) made a bid approach in 2016 but negotiations fell through as it was only interested in parts of the business, other sources have said.
The spin-off is subject to regulatory approvals, tax and legal considerations and a final approval by the FCA board.
The carmaker may modify or call off the transaction at any time and for any reason, it added.

Milan-listed shares in FCA were up 4.7 percent by 1034 GMT, the top gainer in Italy's blue chip index (FTMIB) which was up 1.8 percent.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","China tariffs on U.S. business jets seen a boon for Canada's Bombardier, others","By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed
MONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's plan to slap tariffs on some U.S.-made planes will hit demand for Gulfstream and Boeing business jets but benefit Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and other rivals seeking a larger share of Asia's biggest market, jet brokers and analysts said.
China's Ministry of Commerce announced plans on Wednesday to place a 25 percent tariff on U.S. aircraft with an ""empty weight"" of between 15,000 kilograms and 45,000 kilograms amid a trade spat between the nations.
That category would include General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) popular Gulfstream G550 and G650s and the larger Boeing (N:BA) Business Jet 1 that competes against models from European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR). 
Gulfstreams are the top-selling business jet brand in China, where they compete fiercely against Bombardier's Global series and, to a much lesser extent, against the smaller Falcon models of France's Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD).
The United States remains the world's largest market for business jets, but the Greater China market is expected to be the fastest-growing major market over the next 20 years, with the fleet size more than doubling, according to a Bombardier forecast.
Jackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based plane broker and charter firm JetSolution Aviation Group, said Gulfstream has traditionally been the market leader in China because it entered earlier, but Bombardier had increased marketing in the last three years in an effort to catch up.
""It is just like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930),"" she said. ""They keep enhancing the product niches having the new generation of the models and competing with each other. This (the higher tax rate) will definitely favor Bombardier over Gulfstream's products.""
Bombardier and Gulfstream representatives said that it was ""premature"" to comment on the Chinese tariffs, while Boeing said neither government had yet imposed the ""drastic measures"" while dialogue between the countries continued.
COST ADVANTAGE FOR BOMBARDIER
Mainland China had a fleet of 318 business jets at the end of 2016, data from aviation consultancy Asian Sky Group shows.
Of the mainland China business jet fleet, 102 were made by Gulfstream, 80 by Bombardier, 37 by Dassault, 15 by Airbus and 10 by Boeing.
Growth in new jet sales stalled between 2013 and 2016 due to an anti-corruption drive that some led wealthy Chinese to buy used jets or charter them instead but brokers have since reported signs of a rebound.
Gulfstream's G650 jets will continue to have unmatched flight range at the top end of the pure business jet segment until Bombardier brings the competing Global 7000 long-range jet into service this year.
U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said that Bombardier would benefit if the trade battle is sustained.
""Adding 25 percent to the cost of a G650ER is very good news for the Global 7000, just as it enters production,"" he said. 
The Gulfstream G650ER has a list price of around $67 million, versus the Global 7000 at around $73 million.
Bombardier has marketed the Global 7000 heavily in countries like China, Singapore and Australia because of its ultra long range reaching Beijing to New York.
""China remains an important international market for business aircraft with expectations that as airspace is continued to open that demand should follow,"" said Toronto-based AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray.
But Murray said he would be cautious on any near-term benefit generated for the Global 7000 by Chinese tariffs on Gulfstream, in light of its heavy backlogs.

""There is such a long wait for Bombardier to deliver the aircraft,"" jet broker Wu said. ""If you order today the delivery will be around 2022.”

226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",The Fed Will Look Past This Latest Turmoil in Markets: Tim Duy,"(Bloomberg View) -- The turmoil in equities continued this week with the S&P 500 Index down about 10 percent from its record high in January. Although the sell-off implies tighter financial conditions, don’t expect the Federal Reserve to change course yet.
Central bankers will need more evidence that Wall Street’s problems threaten to spill over onto Main Street before they abandon plans for further interest-rate increases. Friday’s employment report is more important for the path of rates than recent financial market action.
When asked about financial imbalances in his most recent press conference on March 21, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the risks as moderate due to improved capitalization, liquidity and risk management for large financial institutions. He specifically commented on stock prices:
In some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms. You can think of some equity prices. You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets. But we don’t see it in housing, which is key. And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities in our view.
Powell’s remarks likely dominate the thinking at the Fed. Some asset prices, such as equities, look high by historical comparison. Unsaid is that a correction like the one currently underway would not be unexpected. But not unexpected is not necessarily problematic. Falling equity prices would become a problem if they triggered systemic failures in the financial sector, leading to a broad contraction of credit that spreads from Wall Street to Main Street.
Central bankers are sufficiently confident in the strength of the financial system that they are focusing their attention on the incoming economic data rather than the stock market. And that data, including the recent acceleration in personal consumption expenditures inflation and strength in the manufacturing sector, tends to support the Fed’s plans for further rate hikes. Countering this data would require a much deeper equity correction. At this point, expect another rate boost in June.
The Fed’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections shows that policy makers still expect to boost rates three times in 2018. But this is somewhat deceptive. The two low estimates in the survey anticipate no more hikes this year. The vast majority of Federal Open Market Committee participants are split between three and four increases, while one anticipates five. Eliminating the two low estimates on the Fed’s “dot plot” would place the median projection at four hikes.
Given this split opinion, continued weakness in equity markets could be a factor in swinging the FOMC to three rather than four hikes, all else equal. Recall that Fed Governor Lael Brainard cited easy financial conditions as a tailwind supporting growth this year. Remove that tailwind, and the case for four hikes rather than three might weaken somewhat.
But such speculation is premature. The declines in equities so far are unlikely to have much impact on rate policy given the current environment where, according to the Fed, the economy sits near or beyond full employment. More important for the path of monetary policy is this week’s employment report for March. A mix of continued strong job growth, a further decline in the unemployment rate, and stronger wage growth would overshadow recent equity declines and further cement the Fed’s case for additional rate hikes.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are under increasing pressure to diversify production of their sports utility vehicles (SUVs) outside of the United States as a result of Washington's growing trade tensions with China.
Beijing's proposed 25 percent tax on U.S. car factory exports will hit nearly 270,000 vehicles, with German carmakers accounting for $7 billion of the $11 billion total.
""This is a tax on Southern Germany, not the U.S.,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said on Thursday. ""A 25 percent additional auto tariff would represent a $1.73 billion negative tariff impact directed at Southern Germany by China.""
BMW, the largest vehicle exporter from the United States in terms of value, has its largest factory in Spartanburg, North Carolina and faces a $965 million impact from tariffs, with Daimler exposed to a $765 million hit, Evercore ISI said.
The company makes its X3, X4, X5, X6 and X7 sports utility vehicles in Spartanburg, and the trade dispute will only add pressure to move production of volume sellers like the X5 to markets outside the United States, a senior BMW source said.
But any switch from one factory to another costs millions of euros, takes months to implement, and is taken with a long-term view, BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said last month.
""We have to make decisions, like about factories in Spartanburg or factories in Mexico, which are based on a horizon of 20 to 30 years. If we were to change our strategy whenever a tweet comes out, we would get crazy,"" he told Reuters. 
HARMFUL FOR ALL
Around 18 percent of all BMWs sold in the world's largest car market were exported from Spartanburg last year, a total of 100,203 cars and the carmaker warned that a further escalation of the trade row ""would be harmful for all stakeholders"".
China has threatened to double tariffs to 50 percent on imported automobiles and other U.S.-made goods to retaliate against U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on products including vehicles and automotive parts.
""The BMW Group stands for free trade worldwide: Our company has a global production network and a global sales market,"" it added in a statement late on Wednesday.
BMW this year quietly stopped exporting the X3 from the United States to China amid escalating trade tensions, moving the production footprint of the X3 to a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa and another in Shenyang, China. 
""Thirty-five percent of those (vehicles) exported to China were the BMW X3, which is no longer exported from Spartanburg to China,"" BMW said.
The move to ramp up production capacity in China also stems from tightening requirements by Chinese regulators to increase sourcing of components from local suppliers.
Daimler, parent company of Mercedes-Benz, declined to provide specific export figures from the United States to China and said: ""We don’t speculate about ongoing negotiations. We are of course monitoring the situation closely."" 
Other companies that will be affected include Tesla (O:TSLA), which ships an estimated 15,000 cars a year to China from its California plant and Ford (N:F).
Decisions on whether and where to shift vehicle production could be complicated by moves to significantly revamp or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows tariff-free shipments of vehicles to the United States from Mexico and Canada.

BMW shares were trading up 0.55 percent at 87.9 euros at 1047 GMT, while Daimler stock was up 1.47 percent at 69.12 euros. Both lagged Germany's blue-chip DAX (GDAXI) index, which was 1.9 percent higher.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 11:37AM ET</span>",JPMorgan's Dimon praises Trump's deregulatory efforts in annual letter,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon complimented the administration of President Donald Trump in an annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, saying tax cuts and deregulatory efforts were helping his bank make more money.
Dimon, who runs the biggest U.S. bank, drew a contrast between Trump's moves and those of other elected officials who he said had not struck the right balance for the economy between regulation and free commerce.
He praised the Trump administration for insisting that ""rules around cost-benefit analysis be properly applied"" and for trying to give regulators ""the proper authority to use common sense.""
Using nearly half of the 46-page letter to promote his views on public policies, Dimon played to his roles as the public face of Wall Street and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, a CEO lobbying group. 
Dimon said new federal tax law and ""a more constructive regulatory environment"" adopted since the 2016 presidential election give him hope that JPMorgan will be able to invest more of its excess capital to grow the bank and expand into new markets.
He emphasized JPMorgan's ability in the new climate to earn a return on tangible equity of 17 percent, two points higher than the target before corporate tax cuts were enacted and nearly four points greater than the company delivered in 2017.
Offering bank investors a view of the company stock, Dimon contended that it still made financial sense for JPMorgan to buy back shares ""even at or above two times tangible book value"" per share, which was $53.56 at year-end. JPMorgan shares closed at $110.99 on Wednesday.
To show that government regulation needs to be ""smart,"" Dimon included a reprint of a 1992 newspaper essay by the late liberal U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential candidate George McGovern, who recounted how he had learned late in life that regulations could crush businesses.
Dimon, 62, has said in the past that he was a Democrat, but in recent years he has avoided siding with a political party. He said in the letter that partisanship causes bad public policy.
He called for ""improved merit-based immigration,"" particularly for those who get an advanced degree in the United States. ""We need skilled individuals in America,"" he wrote.
He also said the U.S. should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Trump has rejected.
Interviewed later on Thursday morning on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance, Dimon said he and other CEOs had talked to Trump about trade policy a month ago.
""Obviously, we weren't very effective,"" Dimon said. """"We told him what we thought and it wasn't what he thought at the time.""

Asked how Trump was doing as president, Dimon said he chose to address specific policy actions: ""I am not going to assess a president after a year.""

""We have rejected all offers to buy (the company). One can have a lot of money but if you are not free, what do you do with it?,"" Domenico Dolce said in an interview with fashion's most famous duo in Italian daily Corriere della Sera.
He did not give any details of offers from buyers the company had received.
The unlisted group is one of the ten largest fashion groups in Italy by revenues and had sales of 1.3 billion euros in the year ending in March 2017. The brand is popular among celebrities for its bold and opulent designs. 
Asked who would inherit the group's ""fortune"" Stefano Gabbana said: ""Once we will be dead, we will be dead.""
""I don't want a Japanese designer to design for Dolce & Gabbana,"" he added, without elaborating. 
The two designers, who remained business partners after their romantic relationship ended, said they had divided everything up and created a trust for the company which neither of the two can touch. 
This is intended to safeguard one of the two in case something happens to the other partner, but the designers did not reveal any further details.

In a similar move, in October, veteran designer Giorgio Armani said that under his succession plans part of his fashion empire would be transferred to a foundation recently created in his name.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 04:46AM ET</span>",Uber to suspend service in Greece after new legislation,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Ride-hailing service Uber said on Thursday it would suspend its licensed service in Greece after the approval of local legislation which imposes stricter regulation on the sector.
Uber, which operates a licensed service in the Greek capital, has faced opposition from local taxi drivers who accuse it of taking their business.
""New local regulations were voted on recently with provisions that impact ride-sharing services,"" Uber said in a blog post. ""We have to assess if and how we can operate within this new framework and so will be suspending uberX in Athens from next Tuesday until we can find an appropriate solution."" 
Uber operates two services in Athens: UberX, which uses professional licensed drivers, and UberTAXI, which uses taxi drivers.
The new regulations require each trip to start and end in the fleet partner's designated headquarters or parking area, something Uber does not do. A digital registry of all ride-sharing platforms and their passengers will also be created.
The company launched in Europe in 2011, angering some local authorities and taxi drivers who said it did not abide by the same rules on insurance, licensing and safety.
Following widespread protests, court battles and bans, Uber has taken a more emollient stance under its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, suspending operations in various cities in order to comply with local regulations.
UberX launched in Athens in 2015 and more than 450,000 people have used its smartphone app to book a ride. News of the new regulation last year angered some Athenians and tens of thousands signed a petition launched by Beat - a local ride-sharing service - in favor of ride-hailing services.
UberX drivers have to be employed by fleet partners such as car rental companies or tourist agencies and their cars could not be more than seven years old. 

The data registry and return-to-garage requirement will only apply to ride-hailing services like Uber and Beat, while taxi drivers will be able to use cars that are up to 22 years old.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks jumped on Thursday as investors bought back into risky assets as concerns over trade tensions ebbed.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 1.5 percent to a two-week high in early deals, buoyed by financials and industrials stocks, riding a wave of gains that pushed Wall Street and Asian stocks up overnight.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the market most exposed to China, jumped 1.7 percent. After the FTSE 100, the top German stock index has been the worst-performing in 2018. https://tmsnrt.rs/2q7NMsf
After a retaliatory blow from China against U.S. tariffs drew conciliatory noises from Washington, some investors calculated a full-blown trade war would be averted.
Citi strategists said it was too early to call a bear market and stuck with an estimate for global equities to rise 8 percent by year-end.
Basic resources and tech stocks, the sectors seen as most vulnerable to higher trading costs, led gains on Thursday. Chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and ASML (AS:ASML), telecom equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA), and software company SAP (DE:SAPG), were the top performers, up 1.8 to 3.8 percent. 
Heavyweight financials, a bellwether of investors' perception of global market risks, added the most points to the index. Top gainers included HSBC (L:HSBA),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Santander (MC:SAN).
Big industrial exporters  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), ABB (S:ABBN), and Airbus (PA:AIR) rose 1.8 to 3.5 percent. Airbus (PA:AIR) could benefit from Chinese tariffs on U.S. aircraft imports, which could hurt arch-rival Boeing (N:BA).
Trade concerns aside, dealmaking and results continued to drive individual stock moves.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) shares gained 2.9 percent after sources told Reuters that Italian state lender CDP was set to buy a stake in the telecom company. 
Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) rose 1.9 percent. Both companies declined to comment.
Video games maker  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP) jumped 8.6 percent. Traders pointed to the success of its latest video game Far Cry 5, which broke franchise sales records according to one analyst. 
Global equity strategists at Citi downgraded continental European equities to ""neutral"" and upgraded UK equities to ""overweight"", arguing recent underperformance and cheap valuations made the UK market relatively more attractive.
Slowing momentum in economic indicators has sparked concern among investors in European equities whose holdings had been boosted by a ""Euroboom"" trade last year when the region delivered strong growth.

The economic surprise index for the euro zone has fallen to its lowest in nearly two years.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>",Long positions in most Asian currencies rise on shaky dollar outlook: Reuters poll,"By Rushil Dutta
(Reuters) - Investors strengthened their long positions in most Asian currencies over the past two weeks, while bearish bets on the Indian rupee were reversed as trade tensions clouded the U.S. dollar outlook.
Uncertainty around where the U.S.-China trade standoff is headed has dulled the dollar's appeal.
The dollar index (DXY), which was trading up 0.03 percent against a basket of major currencies at 0532 GMT, has recorded five straight quarters of losses into the first quarter of 2018.
The outlook for the greenback remains dim despite market expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish monetary stance, with several market players pricing in more than three rate hikes this year.
""Despite the apparent improvement in global risk appetite levels overnight, we are obviously not out of the woods yet with respect to global trade war tensions,"" said Emmanuel Ng, FX strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation.
Relatively steady short-term Asian currency options, backed by improved foreign investment inflows, indicated a supportive backdrop for local currencies, he added. 
The Korean won  proved to be the biggest beneficiary of dollar bearishness, with long positions in the currency at their strongest since the beginning of January.
With the U.S.-China trade tensions as backdrop, South Korea and the United States renegotiated a six-year-old trade pact known as KORUS, which has a side-deal that requires South Korea increase the transparency of its foreign exchange interventions. 
Also, much of the won's strength this year is an overhang from stellar gains last year. However, it has seen sharp fluctuations lately, which government officials said early this week they were watching. The currency continues to be on the U.S. currency monitoring list. 
Long wagers on the Singapore dollar , Taiwanese dollar , and the Malaysian ringgit  also grew, the poll of 12 market participants showed.
Similarly, bearish sentiment on the Indian rupee  reversed ahead of a Reserve Bank of India meeting on Thursday.
Despite a weak inflation report, the RBI is seen by markets as having ruled out a rate cut, and is expected to stand pat on rates for a fourth straight time at its impending monetary meeting. 
Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan  were largely unchanged for a fourth straight time in the past month and a half, although a separate Reuters poll expects the currency to slip marginally against the dollar in 2018. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

241,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",UK asset managers told to show they offer value for money,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asset managers must assess each year how much value for money they offer investors, Britain's markets watchdog said on Thursday, stopping short of tougher measures called for by critics of the 7 trillion pound ($9.84 trillion) sector.
The Financial Conduct Authority said that asset managers will have 18 months to prepare for a requirement from September 2019 to make an annual assessment of value, ""as part of their duty to act in the best interests of the investors in their funds"".
Fund managers will also have to appoint at least two independent directors to their boards, the FCA said in a statement.
These reforms build on the watchdog's sweeping review of Britain's asset management sector published last June that found evidence of weak price competition.
That review was criticized for shying away from tougher requirements on fee transparency.
The FCA on Thursday also launched a further consultation on remedies related to funds providing better information about their products, covering how fund objectives can be expressed more clearly to investors and benchmarks the fund uses for tracking performance.
This would make life harder for so-called ""closet trackers"" or funds which say they actively chose investments - and therefore charge higher fees. Tracker funds which follow a well-known benchmark, such as the FTSE100 index, charge lower fees.
The FCA said the chair of an asset management firm's board will become directly accountable to regulators for assessing value for money and ensuring that independent directors are nominated.
Asset managers will have a year to comply with changes to how they profit from investors buying and selling their funds - known as box profits - and with steps that make it easier for investors to shift into cheaper share classes, the FCA said.
""Today’s announcements are an important part of a package of measures that, combined, aim to achieve a fair, transparent, open and accountable market,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition.
Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at broker AJ Bell, said the asset management industry was ripe for change to give investors better choices.

""For far too long, many fund providers seem to have forgotten just whose money it is they manage, hiding behind vague objectives and excessive charges,"" Doran said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (T:9107) (K-Line) has pleaded guilty to criminal cartel conduct in the transport of vehicles, Australia's competition regulator said on Thursday, the second Japanese shipping company to make such an admission.
The conduct relates to the shipping of cars, trucks and buses to Australia between 2009 and 2012, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commision (ACCC).
Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) (T:9101) was convicted last year by Australia's Federal Court and fined A$25 million ($20 million) for its part in the activity.
The ACCC on Thursday declined to disclose details relating to the K-Line complaint.
During the NYK case the court found that cartel members fixed freight prices for carrying Nissan, Suzuki, Honda, Toyota and Mazda vehicles to Australia and agreed not to try and win business from each other from as early as February 1997.
Senior managers from NYK were in regular contact with rivals over such matters, even taking telephone calls in hallways or lift lobbies to avoid being overheard by more junior employees who may have reported their conduct, Justice Michael Wigney said last August in his judgment.
Australian law only criminalized the cartel behavior in 2009.
A spokesman in K-Line's headquarters in Tokyo confirmed the ACCC announcement was true, but declined to comment further as the case was ongoing.
NYK's fine was the second-largest ever imposed by the regulator, however it was lower than what it could have been due to an early guilty plea, contrition, and cooperation with investigators.
The matter against K-Line will now proceed to sentencing and is next scheduled for a hearing in the Australian Federal Court in November, the ACCC said in a statement.
The penalty for cartel conduct under Australian competition law is the greater of A$10 million, triple the benefit attributed to the offense, or 10 percent of the corporation's annual turnover in Australia.
The regulator added that its investigation into other alleged cartel participants would continue, though it did not name them in its statement.

Twenty-nine percent of the sportswear company's vice presidents are women, while the company's global workforce is split between 52 percent men and 48 percent women, Matheson said in an emailed statement.
To accelerate the process of representation the company will launch targeted training programs, invest in a diversity sourcing team as well as ""Unconscious Bias training"" for all managers, Matheson said.
Nike was conducting a review in March of its human-resources systems and practices for elevating internal complaints. Nike brand president Trevor Edwards resigned last month, while the company announced probes into workplace complaints.

Earlier on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal, citing an internal memo, reported that Matheson told employees the company ""has failed to gain traction"" in hiring and promoting women and minorities, weeks after complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior led to a leadership change.

The approval marks the end of a break-neck-pace bankruptcy that began in late January, when the Carlyle Group-backed company sought Chapter 11 relief and blamed the costs of complying with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for its financial woes.
""This is another important milestone in our quest to strengthen our financial foundation and ensure that PES can successfully emerge from the restructuring process,"" the company said in a statement. 
The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel or buy credits, known as RINs, from those that do. 
PES needed to submit some 470 million credits to the EPA to prove compliance for 2016 and 2017, but only had 210 million on hand. The refiner said it did not have the money to go into the market and buy the additional credits.
Under the settlement agreement, PES was only required to turn in the credits it had acquired to prove compliance, including a portion of this year's credits, saving close to $200 million. 
Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the company's bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.
The settlement angered the biofuel industry, which said it rewarded a company for ignoring the law. Growth Energy, a pro-biofuels trade group, sought to intervene in the bankruptcy and force Carlyle (O:CG) to pay the outstanding compliance costs.

""The EPA's sue-and-settle-style settlement will give the  Carlyle Group  a free pass for skirting the law, even after they neglected the refinery while pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash payouts"" Emily Skor, Growth Energy's chief executive officer, said in statement.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",World stocks advance as trade war worries ease,"By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher on Thursday as investors responded to signs of an easing of Sino-U.S. trade tensions by dipping back into riskier assets.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.5 percent, while shares in Europe (STOXX) jumped 1.7 percent to a two-week high. 
Cyclical sectors including basic resources (SXPP), autos (SXAP) and banks (SX7P), hit particularly hard over the past two sessions in Europe, led gains. 
Sentiment was lifted as Washington expressed a willingness to negotiate, after proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods prompted swift retaliation from Beijing.
U.S. S&P 500 mini futures (ESc1) rose 0.4 percent, leaving Wall Street poised to build on Wednesday's rebound. 
The dollar (DXY) also drew support, hitting a two-week high of 90.34 against a basket of major currencies and rising against the safe-haven yen to 107.02 yen . 
The euro (EUR=) dipped slightly to $1.2264. 
Proposed 25 percent U.S. tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products from China will be subject to a consultation period expected to last around two months.
""I think that the substance of trade restrictions and their real impact will be far less than the headlines,"" said Jeffery Becker, Chairman and CEO at Jennison Associates in New York.
""U.S. and Chinese cross-border trade has grown significantly over the last decade and economic inter-dependence runs very deep, deeper than the actual trade numbers.""
Asian stocks also benefited, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) up 0.6 percent, a day after it hit its lowest in almost two months.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) ended 1.5 percent higher. Markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday on Thursday.
Many suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China.
That is considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing's trade arsenal given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Donald Trump in the presidential election.
U.S. soybeans  and corn (Cc1) regained ground on Thursday, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day.
NOT SO RISKY?
Some observers argue that the global economy is currently running so well that it could cope with the impact of the proposed tariffs, which cover a fraction of world trade.
""We've had a few months now where markets have really been going sideways and progressively lower, but at the same time has data really rolled over? The answer is no,"" Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said.
""The underlying economy is actually chugging along which will increase the scope for upside surprises on the corporate front, on the economic front and at some point markets will have to catch up to that.""
U.S. data on Wednesday underscored the prevailing bullish view on the economy. Private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, boding well for Friday's jobs data.
A correction since January has driven share price valuations down from record levels, attracting bargain hunters.
MSCI ACWI (MIWD00000PUS) traded at 14.77 times its forward earnings, the lowest in more than two years.
Oil prices gave up earlier gains to trade in negative territory, with U.S. crude futures (CLc1) at $63.24 per barrel.

Bond markets were hit by the recovery in equities as demand for safe-haven assets ebbed. The yield on the German 10-year (DE10YT=RR) touched a one-week high of 0.538 percent, while U.S. treasury yields (US10YT=RR) were at 2.821 percent.

Broadcom, which was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore's Avago, had announced its plan to redomicile on Nov. 2, days before making its first offer for Qualcomm.
The company said it exchanged all shares of Broadcom Ltd to newly issued stock of Broadcom Inc on a one-for-one basis and that its stock would continue to trade under the same ticker.
Broadcom's existing co-headquarters in San Jose, California will become its sole headquarters, the company said. 
The move to the United States could allow Broadcom to buy U.S. companies without coming under the scrutiny of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the power to stop deals that could harm national security. 

Broadcom's shares were up 0.4 percent at $237.97 in after hours trading.

(Reuters) - Ides Capital, one of only two U.S. activist hedge funds run by a woman, was partly behind the appointment of a female independent director this week at U.S. industrial technology company AstroNova Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
AstroNova did not disclose the role of Ides when it announced on Tuesday that it would add Stallergenes Greer Plc board director Yvonne Schlaeppi to its own board, while two of its oldest directors by age, Graeme MacLetchie and Everett Pizzuti, will retire from the board.
Four of the company's six directors will now be independent. 
Ides Capital privately nominated a ""diverse"" slate of directors to AstroNova's board last month, but it will likely not pursue a proxy fight following the changes to the board this week, the sources said, asking not to be named because the discussions were private.
The hedge fund also sent a letter to the company's board last month urging AstroNova to improve its corporate governance by adding independent and diverse board members and strengthening its board succession plans.
Ides will remain a shareholder and continue to push for changes at the company, the sources said. The size of its stake in AstroNova could not be learned.
A representative for Ides declined to comment. AstroNova could not be reached for comment.
AstroNova shares closed 1 percent higher on Wednesday at $16.10, giving the Rhode Island-based company a market capitalization of $108.9 million. 
Ides Capital, co-founded in 2015 by Dianne McKeever, a former Barington Capital partner, is one of only three activist hedge funds globally that is headed by a woman, according to research firm Activist Insight. 
Washington-based Cartica Capital, which focuses on emerging markets investing, is the only woman-led activist firm, Activist Insight said. 
Ides Capital on its LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page describes itself as seeking to ""constructively engage with management teams and corporate boards to improve corporate governance practices.""
Ides' most well known investment was in 2016 when it waged a proxy fight with airplane wireless provider Boingo Wireless Inc. It settled after Boingo added three independent directors to its board.

Smucker Co (N:SJM) said on Wednesday it would buy Rachael Ray Dog food maker Ainsworth Pet Nutrition for about $1.9 billion in cash to strengthen its pet food portfolio, and was exploring options for its U.S. baking business, including a sale.
Smucker's deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions of pet food companies by traditional processed food makers and comes on the heels of  General Mills  Inc's (N:GIS) purchase of high-end pet food maker  Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc  (O:BUFF) for about $8 billion.
Mars, Cargill and Nestle (S:NESN) have also added pet food companies to their portfolio, fighting for a share of the fast-growing $30 billion U.S. pet food market.
U.S. retail pet food sales rose over three times as fast as the 1.2 percent growth in sales of packaged foods last year, according to research firm Euromonitor.
""Ainsworth Pet Nutrition is an excellent strategic fit for our company, as the Rachael Ray Nutrish brand adds another high-growth, on-trend brand to our pet food portfolio,"" J. M. Smucker Chief Executive Officer Mark Smucker said.
The deal, which the company will fund with debt, is valued at $1.9 billion, excluding an expected tax benefit of about $200 million.
The deal increases Smucker's pet food portfolio to 15 brands.
The company said it expects annual cost synergies of $55 million within first three years and net sales of about $800 million in the first year following the deal.
J. M. Smucker also confirmed on Wednesday reports that it planned to explore alternatives for its U.S. baking business, including a sale.
The baking business, which includes brands like Pillsbury and Martha White, generates about $370 million in annual sales. Bloomberg reported last month that the business could fetch about $700 million if sold.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) provided Smucker with financing for the Ainsworth deal.
J.M. Smucker's shares were up 1.6 percent at $123.70 in after-market trading.

By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The buzzy debut of  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday drew retail investors across generations, not just the Millennials who make up the largest proportion of the music streaming service's customer base, retail brokerages said on Wednesday.
Spotify's listing was hotly followed, as it went public via the unusual method of a direct listing, without selling new shares. There was demand for the stock, and shares ended up 12.9 percent on their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, the shares ended the day's session at $145.87, down 2.1 percent from Tuesday's close.
Social media platform Snap Inc's (N:SNAP) high-profile IPO last year had been notable for being popular with Millennials, the primary user base for the company's mobile app Snapchat. But though Millennials are also a key demographic for Spotify, the Swedish company's listing did not draw disproportionate interest from that generation.
Demand was seen across age groups, according to brokerages Fidelity and TD Ameritrade. 
""There's good interest in it,"" said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief market strategist, who is based in Chicago. ""It's pretty well split across age groups."" 
Fidelity said among its customers, baby boomers were slightly more active in trading Spotify shares than Millennials or members of Generation X. Baby boomers made nearly one-third more trades than Millennials and 20 percent more trades than members of Generation X. A similar pattern holds for other tech IPOs, a Fidelity spokesman said.
Retail investor behavior indicated some caution about jumping in.
On StockTwits, a social media platform whose users are mostly retail investors, only 40 percent of members were bullish on Spotify ahead of the debut. Negative sentiment toward the IPO rose as the date approached and the expected trading price climbed, said Garrett Hoffman, StockTwits senior data scientist. 
""Our community is as bearish as they've ever been (about Spotify),"" Hoffman said.
On the site, users posted messages expressing concerns about Spotify's lack of profits and competition from companies such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
High-profile IPOs of companies associated with the tech sector have had a mixed track record in the past year. Shares of MuleSoft Inc (N:MULE) and  Roku  Inc (O:ROKU), which went public in March 2017 and September 2017, respectively, have climbed more than 100 percent since those companies' IPOs. On the other hand, shares of Snap and  Blue Apron Holdings Inc  (N:APRN) have fallen below their IPO prices. 
Individual investors who spoke with Reuters similarly expressed reservations about buying Spotify shares.
""I think a lot of similarly situated retail investors still view many of the VC-backed, marketplace tech companies as destined IPO flops,"" said Layla Tabatabaie, an entrepreneur and advisor to tech startups who lives in New York.
Others said they would only consider buying the stock at a lower price.

""It's certainly a strong company in regards to the service it offers,"" said Jonathan Johnson, a relationship banker in Portland, Oregon. ""I'd consider buying it but not at these (price) levels.""

261,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Banks get first quarter boost from U.S. syndicated lending: Freeman,"By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK(LPC) - Bank earnings got a first-quarter boost from arranging US syndicated loans, and should benefit more significantly in coming months as financings begin to close on large mergers and takeovers announced early this year.
An ongoing push by companies to refinance and cut costs on existing debt, along with a dealmaking wave stoked by US tax reform that cut the corporate rate to 21% from 35%, should keep lending active through the year and bolster related bank fee income, strategists and bankers said. 
Fees from underwriting leveraged loans to highly indebted companies rose 13% from the year-ago period to US$2.57bn in the first quarter, the highest first three months in records dating back 20 years, according to Freeman Consulting Services.
Although leveraged lending volume was down 33% in the first quarter from the same quarter last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, Freeman said there was a shift toward more new-money issuance and more sponsor-led versus corporate-led deals that are higher-margin transactions. 
For extending loans to high-quality companies, banks earned US$512m in the first quarter, also the highest first-quarter income in records dating back two decades.
“There’s a big pipeline that suggests the rest of the year can be as strong as the beginning of the year,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman, which estimates fees based on Thomson Reuters data.
On the leveraged side, the announced US$13.5bn loan and bond financing supporting Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s purchase of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk unit, for example, has yet to launch or be counted in fee totals. The buyout for the F&R unit, which includes LPC, is the largest since the financial crisis.
The situation is similar for lending to investment-grade companies, with temporary financing lined up that has yet to be replaced by the permanent bond debt that magnifies fee intake. 
 Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), for one, in late March had lined up a US$23.7bn 364-day bridge loan, a US$3bn three-year term loan and a US$3.25bn five-year revolving credit for the health insurer’s roughly US$52bn acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, LPC reported.
“Even though announced deal activity is at the highest level that is has been since the middle of 2016, a lot of the deals haven’t closed yet and a lot of the fees really haven’t been recognized yet,” Nassof said. “We are seeing the bridge loan fees, but the fees for the bonds that will ultimately take out the initial bridges can be significantly higher.”
The dealflow was sufficient to overshadow the lost earnings potential from the largest loan commitment ever: a US$100bn financing to back Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd’s planned US$117bn takeover of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc that fell away when US President Trump blocked the deal in mid-March over national security concerns.
Freeman estimated at the time that the 12 bridge loan lending banks stood to split a total pool of US$20m to US$40m in fees once the acquisition was scrapped, having had an opportunity to earn up to 10 times that amount once including fees from long-term debt financing if the deal had gone through.
While income from putting together syndicated loans got off to a solid start this year, it was insufficient to boost the total US investment banking fee pool.
When adding bank earnings from equity and bond underwriting, as well as M&A advisory and syndicated loan arrangement, the total US investment banking fee pool dropped 9% in the first quarter to US$11.1bn from US$12.2bn in the year-ago period.

“M&A doesn’t look exceptional in the first quarter but there’s a lot of recent activity that hasn’t been recognized in terms of fees yet, so I think this year will end up fairly good for M&A,” said Nassof.

1. Jobless Claims, Trade Data on Tap
Jobless claims data will provide investors with another clue on the health of the U.S. labor market – a day ahead of nonfarm payrolls – while trade data may draw added attention amid an ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended March 31, expected to show jobless claims rose to 225,000 from 215,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are forecast to rise to 1.849 million from 1.871 million the prior week.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is expected to report the trade gap widened to $56.90 billion in February from $56.60 billion in the prior month.
The U.S. trade deficit has garnered added investor attention in recent days as the U.S. announced tariffs to plug its trade gap with China and force the latter to make trade and investment concessions.
The U.S. trade gap expanded 5.0% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $56.60 billion in January, the Commerce Department said in March.
The dollar clawed back some of its losses against its rivals Wednesday, after easing trade-war fears weighed on the safe-haven yen, supporting a rebound in USD/JPY.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Rebound in Crude Oil Prices in Focus
Natural gas prices rose slightly on Wednesday, as weather guidance remained mostly unchanged overnight with above-normal heating demand expected through next week.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage fell by 26 billion cubic feet last week.
Traders are also expected to monitor developments in crude markets on Wednesday after crude oil prices pared losses heading into settlement following a massive draw in crude supplies. 
Crude futures fell 14 cents to settle at $63.37 a barrel after bouncing from a session low $62.08 a barrel.
3. Trade-War Fears Overblown?
U.S. stocks swung back from steep losses Wednesday as trade-war fears eased somewhat amid growing investor expectations the U.S. and China tariffs are simply a negotiation tactic as neither the U.S. nor the Chinese tariffs will take effect immediately.
The Chinese government did not specify when its 25% duties on 106 U.S. products would be imposed, opting to take a ‘wait and see’ approach as to how the U.S. will implement its proposed tariffs.
Some have suggested that the U.S. tariffs may only come into force at the end of May or early June as U.S. companies have until May 22 to raise objections, while a public hearing is scheduled for May 15.
This leaves plenty of time for the world’s two largest economies to reach an agreement on trade, averting a trade war.
Mizuho said Wednesday the US Treasury Department’s decision to extend the initial 30-day consultation period to 60 days was a sign that the “U.S. side has already left room for negotiation.”
The rebound in U.S. stock markets Wednesday certainty echoed this sentiment as the Dow Jones Industrial Average swung more than 600 points from session lows to end the day sharply higher."

274,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 07:37PM ET</span>",Peering over the cliff: U.S. equity market fragility in six charts,"By Terence Gabriel
(Reuters) - As equity markets show increasing fragility, investors are looking for any sign that selling pressure will wane. Some of those markers could be found in the charts favored by technical analysts - although they suggest investors still face considerable risk.   
With the S&P 500 (SPX) closing on Monday below its 200-Day Moving Average for the first time since the June 2016 Brexit panic, investors worried that an important indicator of the bull market trend has been broken. 
Stocks have traded below that key level now for three consecutive days on fears of an escalating trade war with China and the potential for tougher oversight of the technology companies that have supported the market. On Wednesday, stocks opened sharply in the red, but later recovered some equilibrium.
The following charts reflect the technical vulnerabilities of the market.
(GRAPHIC: S&P - https://reut.rs/2q6HKZy) 
Investors see the 200-day moving average as a proxy for the long-term trend, underpinning the market’s advance. It has been broken only twice since 2016 and the lower close in June 2016 lasted just one day. 
Spending much time below the 200-day moving average, as occurred in late 2015, could coincide with a more severe period of market weakness. That said, the S&P 500 has yet to reach a “failure swing” by violating its early February trough at 2,532.69. Market players may look for the index to reclaim its 50-day moving average - a proxy for the intermediate-term trend - to suggest the recent damage is being repaired.
(GRAPHIC: DJ Industrial Average - https://reut.rs/2GxECMI) 
While the Dow (DJI) is showing similar action, the blue-chip average has not recorded a closing violation of its 200-day moving average during its recent weakness. Even so, the index is also down about 10 percent for the year.
(GRAPHIC: Nasdaq Composite - https://reut.rs/2q3JOl3)
While the Nasdaq (IXIC) surpassed its January peak to reach a record high in March, the index is now down about 9 percent from that top and threatening support at a trend line from its late-June 2016 trough, as well as its 200-day moving average.
(GRAPHIC: Tech Titans - https://reut.rs/2q4DyK2) 
Technology stocks, which have been a driver for the market, handily outperformed the S&P 500 last year, gaining 37 percent vs. the broader index’s 19 percent rise. 
Now a price-weighted composite of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - five of the six largest- capitalized stocks in the S&P 500 - is down close to 12 percent over the past four calendar weeks and on track for the worst such decline in its six-year history. These tech titans account for more than $3.3 trillion in market capitalization, or more than 14 percent of the S&P 500’s total value. Thus, in the absence of a major rotation, action in these key tech stocks may be critical to the market’s next major move.
(GRAPHIC: NYSE Advance/Decline Line - https://reut.rs/2GxzQ5I) 
However, there are some positive indicators: The NYSE daily advance/decline line (A/D), a measure of the overall participation in an advance, peaked in January just a few days prior to the tops in the S&P 500 and Dow. The A/D moved above its 200-day moving average in early 2016, and remains there, which is a positive indicator for market breadth and shows that not all technical signs are negative.
(GRAPHIC: NYSE New High/New Low - https://reut.rs/2Gw8rkB) 
Additionally, another internal measure, the NYSE New High/New Low Index, has fallen below 20 percent and is flirting with its February low of 17.1 percent. Although this reading reflects the weakness that the market has endured, it is potentially reaching washed-out levels, from which a surprise reversal may develop. Thus, despite the market's decline, there may be some silver linings under the surface.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Brazil's BRF places workers from two plants on furlough,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Embattled Brazilian food processor BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), reeling from a food safety scandal, will place 3,500 workers on paid leave at two plants, the latest move to adjust capacity following a government-imposed trade ban affecting exports to the European Union, the company said on Wednesday.
BRF said it would send 1,300 workers on leave at its Carambeí plant in southern Brazil, in addition to 2,300 people from its Rio Verde poultry production line in central Brazil. The leaves, effective from April 21 and April 14 respectively, will last 30 days at both plants, it said. 
""As is in the public domain, Brazil's agriculture ministry decided to temporarily and preemptively suspend production and certification of BRF poultry exports to the European Union from March 16,"" BRF said in a statement. 
The move raises the tally of employees affected by measures to adjust capacity to demand to around 7,000. 
Last month BRF said it would send around 3,000 people on furlough at its Capinzal plant state effective May 7.
BRF also sent more than 1,000 workers on leave at its Mineiros plant, one of the units involved in the food safety investigation that preceded the trade suspension related to Europe. Some 623 people at Mineiros' chicken production line have since returned to work, BRF said on Wednesday.
BRF shares fell 0.5 percent to 23.06 reais in mid-afternoon trading, reaching a low of 37 percent this year, as the company still reels from the food probe, which accused managers of acting to evade safety checks.

The stock price is also impacted by an imminent management shakeup being pushed by controlling shareholders after the company posted its largest ever loss last year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP plans to press ahead with a proxy fight at consumer products group Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL), saying more work is needed to repair the company even after rival activist Carl Icahn won board seats last month.
""We are seeking to elect a minority of the Board because we do not believe that the recent changes at the Company, including the agreement with Carl C. Icahn, are sufficient to address Newell’s subpar operating and financial performance,"" Starboard said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
""Poor execution and a series of operational missteps have resulted in severe share price underperformance,"" Starboard said, adding ""the current situation is unacceptable."" It owns roughly 3.8 percent of Newell, the maker of Rubbermaid containers and Sharpie markers.
Newell's share price has lost roughly 20 percent since January. The stock was up 2.3 percent to $25.47 on Wednesday.
Three weeks ago Icahn reached a settlement with Newell that immediately gave him four board seats. Investors will have a chance to vote on the directors at next month's annual meeting. The deal was seen undercutting Starboard's campaign.
Weeks before the two sides settled, Starboard, run by Jeffrey Smith, announced plans to oust the entire board, including Newell Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk.
Starboard wanted to slow the pace of planned asset sales and stocked its slate with a group of former Newell directors who had resigned from the board earlier in the year after disagreements over strategy.
Starboard is now pressing ahead, listing Smith, Peter Feld, Starboard's head of research, and executives with experience at companies ranging from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) to Michael Cos Inc (O:MIK) as possible directors. While Starboard is not seeking control, it has not said how many directors it plans to run.
Former Newell directors Martin Franklin, Ian Ashman and Domenico DeSole as well as Jim Lillie who previously worked with Franklin, who had been on Starboard's earlier slate. They split with Starboard after Newell settled with Icahn.
Franklin did not want to be caught between two activists, people who know him said.
He told Reuters last month that his blank-check acquisition vehicle  J2 Acquisition  Ltd (L:JTWO) might be interested in buying assets that Newell may sell.
Starboard has been well respected by other investors for its thoroughly laid-out plans on how to unlock value at targeted companies, industry analysts said. 

In Wednesday's filing Starboard said the agreement with Icahn gives the ""appearance of substantial change,"" and it is moving forward to make ""sure that the right change is effected.""

281,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Starboard challenges U.S. mall owner Macerich's board - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Liana B. Baker and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP nominated directors this week to challenge the board of directors of U.S. shopping mall owner  Macerich Co  (N:MAC), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Macerich is the latest mall operator to come under pressure from activist investors during a downturn in the brick-and-mortar retail sector.  Taubman Centers Inc  (N:TCO), another shopping center operator, has attracted activist hedge funds, including Elliott Management Corp. 
Starboard may replace the majority of Macerich's 10-member board, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Macerich and Starboard declined to comment.
Macerich shares were up 4.4 percent at $58.59 in late afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.85 billion.
Macerich owns 53 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of 48 regional U.S. shopping centers. The company rejected a $16.8 billion bid from rival Simon Property Group Inc (N:SPG) in 2015 and has struggled since then, as thousands of U.S. stores have closed under pressure from e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Third Point LLC, another activist hedge fund, disclosed a stake in Macerich in November. Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, an activist hedge fund specializing in the real estate sector, also owns Macerich stock.
In the latest sign of consolidation in the sector, commercial real estate company  Brookfield Property Partners LP  (O:BPY) said last week it would acquire the 66 percent of GGP Inc (N:GGP) that it does not already own in a cash-and-stock deal valuing GGP, one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centers, at about $15.3 billion.
In December, Europe's biggest property firm Unibail-Rodamco (AS:UNBP) agreed to buy U.S. and UK mall operator Westfield Corp (AX:WFD) for $16 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts can move forward with a lawsuit accusing credit reporting firm  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX) of failing to safeguard its databases or provide prompt notice of a breach that exposed the personal data of 147 million people, a state court judge has ruled.
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger in Boston, in a decision made public on Wednesday, denied a motion by Equifax to dismiss a lawsuit Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey filed after the breach was disclosed in September.
Salinger wrote that the lawsuit stated a plausible claim that Equifax breached its legal duties to address all reasonably foreseeable risks to its data security and to implement reasonably up-to-date fixes to its software.
The lawsuit alleged that Equifax knew or should have known by March 2017 that a serious security vulnerability existed in computer code that the company used in its systems but failed to patch or upgrade its software to eliminate it.
As a result, hackers were able to access its databases and steal personal information, the lawsuit alleged. 
""These allegations state a viable claim for violation of the data security regulations,"" Salinger wrote.
Equifax declined to comment.
The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing Equifax related to the data breach. It also faces class action lawsuits and investigations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state attorneys general.
The lawsuit that Healey filed in September is the only one by a state attorney general to date. The lawsuit seeks penalties and restitution as well as an order requiring Equifax to disgorge any profits it obtained during the breach.
In a statement, Healey, a Democrat, said her office was prepared to make its case in court to protect state residents and prevent future breaches.
""Today's order confirms that Equifax is not above the law and can be held accountable for violating the rights of Massachusetts consumers,"" she said.
Equifax in March said it expects costs related to its massive data breach to surge by $275 million this year, suggesting the incident could turn out to be the most costly hack in corporate history.

The cost of protecting against declines in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). shares has jumped to a two-year high, with the price between bearish and bullish options becoming the highest among all S&P 500 Index members as of the last close, relative to readings over the past year. While the benchmark gauge has plunged about 9 percent from a record in January, Apple is down only 1 percent. Peers from the Nasdaq 100 Index of large-cap tech equities have dipped 7.8 percent in the period.
Investors are growing skeptical on Apple as concern over trade skirmishes between the world’s two largest economies mount. China is the company’s single-most important market outside the U.S., and most of its production chain is centered there. The Asian nation said on Wednesday it would impose an additional 25 percent levy on about $50 billion of U.S. imports, matching the scale of proposed U.S. tariffs announced on Tuesday.
“Apple is dependent on China for a huge part of its iPhone production, and the fear of a trade war pushes investors to search for protection,” said Mohit Bajaj, the director of exchange-traded funds at WallachBeth Capital in the U.S., who also looks at the broader market and large companies. “Some people didn’t anticipate that the tit-for-tat measures from China would be this big. Market concern around Apple is seen in a soaring hedging cost.”
Concern that Apple’s first-quarter iPhone shipments will fall short of expectations is also growing after analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Rosenblatt Securities Inc. cut their estimates last week. Finally, broader worries about tighter regulation in the U.S. tech sector are bruising sentiment further.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Monte dei Paschi's bosses confident about turnaround plan: sources,"By Maiya Keidan and Paola Arosio
LONDON (Reuters) - The top executives of bailed-out Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) told investors in London on Wednesday the bank is making progress with its turnaround plan, two fund managers who attended the meetings said.
CEO Marco Morelli and CFO Andrea Rovellini said in one-to-one investor meetings they were confident about hitting targets agreed with EU authorities to clear the rescue, one fund manager said.
Morelli and Rovellini did not provide specific figures but said first-quarter earnings, due in May, would confirm the restructuring is on track, the second investor said. 
Italy' fourth-largest bank, brought low by mismanagement and a huge bad loan pile, has been the biggest threat to the country's financial stability for years, until an 8.1 billion euro ($10 billion) bailout last summer handed the Rome government a 68 percent stake. 
But concerns over the Tuscan bank have intensified after Italy's inconclusive election last month, which could produce a government dominated by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League. 
Both parties have opposed the previous government's efforts to shore up the country's banks, which have been struggling to deal with soured loans left over from a recession.
Monte dei Paschi is due to offload by mid-2018 25 billion euros ($31 billion) in bad loans repackaged as securities in Italy's biggest such disposal, with help from a state-sponsored, privately-funded banking support fund.
It plans further sales of 5.4 billion euros to cut soured loans to 14 percent of total lending by the end of 2019, a level which would still be almost three times the European average.
Yielding to regulatory pressures, all major Italian banks have raised their goals to cut problematic loans as bankers say the European Central Bank wants to see their level drop below 10 percent of total lending.
Investors fear Monte dei Paschi may need fresh capital to cover further loan losses or to be able to shed bad debts more quickly than anticipated under its restructuring plan. They also worry about the bank's slow turnaround progress. 
One fund manager said Morelli ruled out the ECB may demand a more ambitious clean-up, after lengthy negotiations over the turnaround plan agreed with Brussels last year. 
Monte dei Paschi's shares have lost 40 percent since they returned to trade on the Milan bourse in late October, prompting both Italy's Treasury and the bank to deny fresh capital may be needed. 
Monte dei Paschi made a 2017 loss of 3.5 billion euros, hit by 5.3 billion euros in loan writedowns as revenues dropped 6 percent.
Banking sources have told Reuters Monte dei Paschi needs to find a partner quickly, possibly as part of a three-way merger, but none have emerged so far.
UBI Banca (MI:UBI), tipped in the Italian press as the most likely suitor, has repeatedly denied any interest.
Monte dei Paschi's shares closed up 1.5 percent, outperforming a 0.5 drop in the European bank index (SX7P)
""It's one of the few names that is up on the day,"" said the fund manager, who holds Monte dei Paschi debt but no shares.
""If you assume that people are going back and voting with their wallets, then they (the management) must be at least getting the messaging right.""
The investor said he expected that the Italian government's stake in the bank would ensure the situation ""gets sorted out"".
He said Morelli and Rovellini, who were accompanied by the head of investor relations, did not talk about a possible partner. ""They've got bigger issues,"" he said, adding that he thought the bank had to be cleaned up first.
Meetings will continue on Thursday, one person said.
Monte dei Paschi declined to comment on the meetings.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. options hedging muted even as stocks approach February lows,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activity in U.S. equity options was slow on Wednesday even as stock indexes flirted with February lows, as expectations for strong corporate earnings quelled the urge to load up on contracts that benefit from a surge in market volatility.
Global markets reeled on fears of deepening trade conflict between China and the United States after China hit back on Wednesday against U.S. plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, retaliating with a list of similar duties on key American imports.
The S&P 500 (SPX) fell as much as 1.6 percent to come less than 2 percent away from the low of 2,532.69 in early February, before trading little changed on the day.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, was up 0.8 points at 21.9. By contrast, it hit 41.06 when the S&P 500 bottomed in February.
""There is definitely a level of complacency,"" said Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager at Financial Enhancement Group, in Indianapolis.
""Not only is it being shown in the VIX and the VVIX but if you look at the term structure for the VIX it's extremely flat,"" he said, referring to the VIX futures curve, which reflects the market's expectation of future volatility of different time horizons.
A flatter VIX futures curve indicates little expectation for increased stock market gyrations.
The Cboe VVIX Index (VVIX), an indicator of the expected swings in the VIX, was at 99.45, not far away from its average reading of 90 for 2017, a period of extremely low stock market swings.
Expectations for a solid earnings season may be keeping fear in check, Thrasher said.
""Coming out of the recent tax changes, there is probably some expectation that earnings should be positive,"" he said.
Trading volume for VIX options, used to place bets on future stock swings, was at 285,000 contracts, or 85 percent of the expected volume, according to Trade Alert.
Other popular hedging vehicles, including options on S&P 500 Index (SPX) and its tracking ETF's (P:SPY) also showed muted activity.
""There is not a mad rush or increased volume in the broad-based indexes and ETFs,"" said Jon Cherry, head of U.S. options at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets in Chicago.
Instead, investors were looking to make the most of the spike in stock swings. 

""What we have seen early this morning is an increased number of investors looking to sell covered calls on single name securities,"" said Cherry, referring to a strategy in which investors sell call options against stock holdings. Increased volatility tends to boost the returns from such sales.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>","U.S.-China trade war could hit German automakers, plus Tesla, Ford","By Paul Lienert and Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China may dent production of German luxury SUVs made in the U.S. South and sent to China, with exports from electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) also vulnerable.
If a tit-for-tat tariff dispute between the two countries erupts into a full-blown trade war, auto production in both will be affected, but U.S. factories would feel the strongest effect because China imports nearly 270,000 U.S. vehicles, worth $11 billion, and sends relatively few back.
Tesla's California plant, which ships an estimated 15,000 cars a year to China, as well as BMW's (DE:BMWG) South Carolina facility and  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Alabama factory, could lose hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of production if China goes ahead with its threat to double import tariffs. All three export high-margin luxury models, many of them sport utility vehicles, to China.
Ford's problem is twofold, involving both imports of premium Lincoln vehicles to China and a plan to export low-cost Focus compacts from China to the United States.
General Motors Co's (N:GM) exposure is limited because it imports only 30,000 Buick Envision crossovers a year from China, while sending just a handful of vehicles back.
Shares of automakers ended higher on Wednesday as Wall Street stocks changed course in the afternoon when investors' trade fears subsided. (N) Tesla shares closed 7.3 percent higher at $286.94, Ford shares gained 1.6 percent to close at $11.33, and GM shares were up 3 percent at $38.03.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) auto analyst Brian Johnson, in an investor note on Wednesday, predicted that Tesla ""would bear the brunt of any increased auto tariff on a relative basis,"" with China accounting for 17 percent of the company's revenue.
The United States has a 60-day comment period on plans, and China is waiting for U.S. action before implementing its own. A Washington-based source close to one of the automakers called the moves ""a posturing exercise by both countries (and) part of a process"" that will play out over the next two months.
China has threatened to double tariffs to 50 percent on imported automobiles and other U.S.-made goods to retaliate against the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on a broad range of products, including vehicles and automotive parts.
The proposed U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles could affect Ford's plans to shift production of the compact Focus next year from Michigan to China, a move the company said last year would save it $500 million.
The Lincoln brand meanwhile is struggling to gain traction in China's crowded luxury car market. Ford has said it ships about 80,000 vehicles a year to China, including various Lincoln models.
Ford declined to comment specifically on plans for the Focus and Lincoln. It said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We encourage both governments to work together to resolve issues between these two important economies.""
A Mercedes-Benz spokesman said the company does not speculate on ongoing negotiations, adding that it is ""monitoring the situation closely.""
BMW said in a statement: ""A further escalation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China would be harmful for all stakeholders.""
Tesla declined to comment. A spokesman for the United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at Ford and GM, but not at Tesla, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, declined to comment.
GM said on Wednesday it is ""too early"" to say how the Trump administration's proposed tariffs will impact its future production plans for the Envision.
Chinese vehicle imports from all markets last year climbed to 1.2 million, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association. Less than a quarter of those - 267,473, according to Statista - came from U.S. auto plants, including 100,000 from BMW's South Carolina factory.

Decisions on whether and where to shift vehicle production could be complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump's moves to significantly revamp or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows tariff-free shipments of vehicles to the United States from Mexico and Canada.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",HSBC has worst gender pay gap among Britain's largest companies,"By Andrew MacAskill and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA), Europe's largest bank, has reported the largest difference in male and female staff salaries among large organizations in Britain, as the government looks to pressure big companies to reduce gender pay disparities.
Swamped by the task of delivering Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to make visible progress on a domestic agenda set out when she took power in July 2016, particularly after a snap election in 2017 that exposed a weakness on social reforms. 
Hoping to highlight gender discrimination and force companies into action, May has implemented long-planned reforms ordering companies with 250 or more employees to publish details of the salary difference between male and female employees by Wednesday evening and report back annually on the pay gap.
HSBC on average paid men 59 percent more than women, the biggest difference among companies with more than 5,000 employees in Britain, according a Reuters analysis of the published data using the mean as the measure.
The next largest gender pay gaps were at Virgin Atlantic, where men received 58 percent more on average more than women, followed by a unit of  Barclays  (L:BARC), where female staff earned 48 percent less than male colleagues.
HSBC said it was confident in its approach to pay and made appropriate adjustments if it identified differences between men and women in similar roles which could not be explained by performance or experience.
Virgin Atlantic said the gap reflected the relatively low number of female pilots in the aviation industry, while Barclays said it had more work to do so women could progress in their careers at the company.
Firms are not required to break down the data in detail, leading to criticism that the average figures could obscure or exaggerate demographic explanations for disparities. Nevertheless, they offer a step forward in assessing the issue.
EQUALITY POLICIES 
Almost 50 years since the passage of Britain's equal pay act, the continued gulf in earnings between men and women has steadily risen up the political agenda. The opposition Labour Party first created powers on gender pay reporting in 2010, but then lost an election. May enacted those powers last year.
Although part of a broader trend of pro-equality policies in Britain, the issue has gained momentum under May, the country's second ever female leader, and increasing competition from her main opponent, socialist campaigner Jeremy Corbyn.
May vowed in 2016 to tackle ""burning injustices"" in society, with a specific reference to gender pay alongside issues like race and class discrimination.
Nearly two years later, she said that by introducing the reporting requirement, her government had taken a lead on the issue.
""By making this information public, organizations will no longer have anywhere to hide,"" she wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. ""Shareholders and customers will expect to see improvements, and will be able to hold organizations to account if they fail to achieve them.""
Other countries to introduce mandatory gender pay gap reporting include Australia, which passed similar legislation in 2012, and Germany.
Reuters analyzed pay figures for 491 of the leading companies, government departments, charities, local authorities and hospital trusts, which employ more than 5,000 people.
Of those organizations that had published data by 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Wednesday, 97 percent pay men more than women and just 3 percent pay women the most. 
The average gender pay gap among these largest companies is 15.5 percent, according to the Reuters analysis. 
Political opponents, including Labour, welcomed publication of the data as a step forward but urged a more hands-on approach, saying the government still lacked clear plans on how to address the problems they had revealed.

""(Theresa May) wants to close the #paygap but says nowhere how she plans to do it. Politicians can't just keep beating up business while leaving structural inequality untouched,"" tweeted Sophie Walker, leader of the Women's Equality Party.

VW said in a statement it will invest 2 billion reais ($595 million) to manufacture the T-Cross compact SUV at its Sao Jose dos Pinhais plant in southern Brazil.
It will start selling the T-Cross in the first half of 2019, it said, adding that the project is part of 7 billion reais of planned investments through 2020 to refresh the line-up in its ""largest product launch offensive ever"" in Brazil. 
VW's market share in Brazil has shrunk over the past decade as new entrants opened local factories just as a recession took hold. An export-driven rebound in the sector last year and record-low interest rates have renewed hope for some global carmakers.
Not everyone is convinced. Honda said separately that it will consolidate all vehicle production in its Itirapina plant, converting a 20-year-old factory in Sumaré from vehicles to engines and other parts.
The transition should be complete by 2021 at the plants, both of which are located in the state of São Paulo. 
Honda announced the new Itirapina plant earlier this decade as a way to double capacity in Brazil amid booming domestic demand, but the downturn interfered with the plans, a press officer said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the government said Brazil's industrial output expanded in February at the slowest pace in five months, underscoring an uneven pace of economic recovery in the first quarter of the year.
Honda's Itirapina plant was finished in April 2015 with capacity to produce 120,000 vehicles per year in two shifts, but the carmaker has so far kept the lines there idle. 
""Though the local market recently recovered, the growth outlook remains below volumes previously forecast,"" Honda's statement said.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Think twice about retirement when picking a kid's college,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - No parent wants to be the spoiler of big college dreams.
But as a record number of parents are going into their 60s with crippling debt leftover from their children’s college years, financial planners are warning parents to resist the urge to help their children at any cost.
“Parents are putting themselves into crisis,” said Byrke Sestok, a White Plains, New York, financial planner. Yet despite pleading with parents to resist, they load themselves up with college loans anyway: “Emotion wins out.”
People used to try to clear away debt before retiring so they could handle monthly expenses when paychecks stop. But the total student loan debt held by people over 60 is $66.7 billion and the average owed is $23,500, according to a 2017 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Sestok is currently working with a couple in their late 50s who will have about $250,000 in student loan debt when their kids finish college in a couple of years. He tried to head them off at the pass by getting them to send their younger daughter to a less expensive school, but they responded: “How can we tell our younger daughter to go to a state school when we didn’t do that with her sister?”
The parents will be paying about $3,000 a month for college loans until they are reach their 70s. With a mortgage, car payments and credit card debt, they will not be able to save any more for retirement for at least 10 more years. 
They have only about $250,000 in a 401(k) at the moment, so with Social Security, that means they will have only about $65,000 to live on each year of retirement – far below their current lifestyle at $200,000.
“It’s a disaster and that assumes their health holds up and they can continue working into their 70s,” Sestok said.
OTHER OPTIONS
When college bills arrive, many parents turn first to federal parent PLUS loans, which currently charge 7 percent interest. There is no limit on borrowing. Although there is a limited credit check, PLUS loans are provided without determining whether a family can afford to pay, said Rachel Fishman, deputy director of research for the New America Foundation.
Sestok said some clients have been able to refinance their PLUS loans with private companies after their kids graduate at about 4 percent recently. Still, he is advising parents now not to count on any loan with a variable rate because interest rates are rising.
While parent PLUS loans can be the easiest source of borrowing, parents also use other options. Some turn to home equity loans, which can have lower interest rates. However, under new tax laws, the interest will no longer be deductible. And with interest rates on the way up, the variable rates on these loans can be risky. 
Parents also may take loans from their 401(k) accounts, up to $50,000. They can take IRA withdrawals for education purposes before age 59 1/2 without penalty and also take principal out of Roth IRA accounts without penalty or tax.
But financial advisers continually warn parents to leave their IRAs and 401(k)s untouched for college. Most people have not saved enough for retirement in the first place and replenishing accounts so close to retirement age usually does not work.
The best bet is to avoid the debt in the first place and to do that, parents must figure out what they can actually afford before they sign loans. Scot Hanson, a Shoreview, Minnesota, financial planner, took on too much PLUS debt himself when his daughter started college a few years ago. 
“I had gone through a divorce and was feeling guilty and wanted to do more for my child,"" he said. ""I was shocked when payments came due right away.""
Now, he quizzes parents considering expensive colleges: “Do you want to work for eight more years before retiring? Do you realize this college may cost you $200,000 or $300,000 that you could have had for retirement?”

""His view on Amazon is we've got to have a level playing field with regards to taxes,"" Kudlow told reporters at the White House. ""They have improved their tax collections, but more can be done.""
Trump, a Republican, has been harshly critical of the company in recent days, making unsubstantiated claims that the U.S. Postal Service is losing money shipping Amazon's packages and accusing the retailer of not paying enough taxes.
Shares of Amazon have slumped, and on Wednesday were down 0.3 percent in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq amid a wider losses on Wall Street over the latest U.S.-China trade spat that has drawn in the technology sector. (N)
Seattle-based Amazon voluntarily collects state sales tax on items it sells direct to customers in all 45 states that impose one, but is not required to collect taxes on third-party sellers using its Marketplace service.
Asked about that, and the bulk shipping rate that Amazon and other companies pay, Kudlow said: ""There's a lot of glitches in that"" but gave no other details. 

Representatives for the retailer could not be immediately reached for comment.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>",Viacom preparing counterproposal to CBS offer: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) is preparing a counterproposal to CBS Corp's (N:CBS) first share exchange offer of 0.55 CBS share for every Viacom share, which Viacom found to be inadequate, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The CBS offer, which was communicated verbally last Friday, valued Viacom at below its market value of around $12.5 billion, according to the sources. The back-and-forth between the companies indicates that tough negotiations lie ahead.
Viacom has not yet decided on the exact share exchange ratio it will ask for, but is expected to seek more than 0.62 CBS share for every Viacom share, one of the sources said. Viacom's counterproposal is expected by Thursday, another of the sources added.
Viacom will argue that potential cost synergies of more than $1 billion mean that it should command a premium in a deal, according to the sources. 
National Amusements Inc, the controlling shareholder of CBS and Viacom, wants Viacom CEO Robert Bakish to be No. 2 in the combined company, the sources said. But CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has offered to run the combined company, wants CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello as No. 2, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. CBS and Viacom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNBC first reported that Viacom had dismissed CBS's offer.
Viacom shares were up nearly 1 percent at $29.69, while CBS shares were up 0.5 percent at $53.14.
CBS and Viacom set up special committees to explore the merger in February, a move to reunite the companies split by controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago.
The two companies explored a merger in 2016 instigated by the Redstone family, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues.
Since then, Bakish has taken a number of steps to boost the company's performance, including improving relations with cable and satellite companies, causing some analysts to expect CBS to acquire Viacom at a premium.
Many of Viacom and CBS's competitors are merging as scale becomes increasingly important in the media landscape, with more customers cancelling pricey cable contracts, and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) spending billions of dollars on making shows and movies.

Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) announced in December it would buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (A:FOX) assets. Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) recently bought Scripps Networks Interactive Inc (O:SNI).

While GM is also planning to discontinue Chevrolet Impala in the next few years,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will stop making the Fiesta small car for the U.S. market by as early as next year, and discontinue the Taurus sedan, the Journal reported.
The move comes at a time when U.S. consumers are increasingly shunning passenger cars in favor of more comfortable sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks.
Ford executives are still considering the future of Fusion cars, the report said. 
General Motors declined to comment, while Ford was not immediately available for comment.
Last month, Ford disclosed plans to shift the product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and cut manufacturing costs.
Demand for sport utility vehicles in the United States is booming, with the number of new models vying for a share of the market growing even faster.
Last month, GM unveiled a revamped luxury pickup truck, intensifying the battle among Detroit's big three automakers for fat profits at the top end of a highly lucrative segment.

SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China on Wednesday announced plans to place a 25 percent tariff on certain U.S. aircraft, in a move expected to affect some older  Boeing Co  (N:BA) narrowbody models, according to documents from China's Ministry of Commerce and the U.S. manufacturer.
But although several analysts said China had spared the newer 737 MAX - key to future Boeing profits - the impact remained uncertain because of a lack of detail in the announcement and the fact that not all airplane characteristics are published.
Boeing shares fell as much as 6 percent after China hit back at U.S. tariffs with the announcement of duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, cars, beef and chemicals, as well as planes.
These include aircraft with an ""empty weight"" of between 15,000 kg and 45,000 kg, or 15 to 45 tonnes.
Depending on how ""empty weight"" is defined, this leaves a question mark over the fate of Boeing's new big-selling 737 MAX 8 jet - though the larger MAX 9 and MAX 10 could be spared. 
The stakes are high. The United States exported $15 billion of aircraft to China in 2016, ranking equally with agricultural products like soybeans as the biggest category of goods.
Several definitions of ""empty weight"" are used in the aircraft industry and the ministry document gave no explanation.
Two industry experts said the rules most likely refer to the ""manufacturer's empty weight,"" or the core aircraft structure.
But manufacturers are usually shy about publishing this number because of its commercial sensitivity, while they do give estimates for the slightly higher ""operating empty weight,"" which includes airline crew and some equipment, but not fuel.
Yet even this number can vary according to an airline's specific requirements, so it is seen as a guideline. 
Whatever category is used, the range appears comfortably to include the current-generation 737 narrowbody aircraft, which is in the midst of being replaced by the newer 737 MAX.
737 MAX 8 IMPACT UNCLEAR
Boeing documents available online list the ""operating empty weight"" (OEW) of the 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900 well within the tariff zone at 37.6 to 42.9 tonnes.
The ""manufacturer's empty weight"" (MEW) would typically be about 1-1.5 tonnes lower, two airplane appraisal experts said.
In contrast, the newer 737 MAX 8 is heavier than its predecessor, with an operating empty weight of 45,070 kg, according to a Boeing document published in August 2017.
Depending on how rules are applied, this leaves it hovering close to the tariff border line and potentially still exposed to sanctions if the more conservative ""manufacturer"" scale is used.
""I would expect a non-variable weight (MEW) to be used as the benchmark, as OEW will vary from operator to operator,"" said Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of UK-based advisory firm IBA, adding this would pull the jet below 45 tonnes.
Even if the more generous OEW weight format were used, not all 737 MAX 8s might escape as some use lighter layouts. ""A 70kg drop is pretty easy once you get into the realms of low-cost carriers or standard single-class operations,"" Hatcher added.
Boeing said in a statement that while the United States and China have both outlined positions that could harm the global aerospace industry, nothing drastic has happened yet. 
""We will continue in our own efforts to proactively engage both governments and build on the recent assurances by U.S. and Chinese leaders that productive talks are ongoing,"" it said. 
Chinese airlines have been on a buying spree from Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) as air travel grows.
Boeing and China's Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) are expected to open a 737 completion center in the coastal city of Zhoushan to install interiors and paint liveries this year.
The bulk of published 737 orders from Chinese that have not yet been delivered are for the newer MAX version. 
However, China Southern Airlines (SS:600029), Ruili Airlines and Okay Airways each have two 737-800s on order and Xiamen Airlines has four more, according to the Boeing order book. 
Asked if the airline's plane buying plans could shift away from Boeing, China Eastern Airlines Corp (SS:600115) Chief Executive Ma Xulun said on Wednesday ""it's too early to say, we will keep an eye on the situation of the China-U.S. trade war.""
Apart from some Boeing jets, the Gulfstream G650, a large corporate jet manufactured by General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), also falls into the weight range targeted for tariffs. 

Gulfstream declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes staged a comeback to close around 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading.
After investors fled equities in the morning due to proposed retaliatory tariffs from China, their concerns about a potential trade war eased by the afternoon after Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in a ""negotiation"" with China rather than a trade war. 
Investors said they were comforted by the fact that any tariffs would not take effect immediately, if at all. Strategists also cited the S&P's bounce above a key technical support level and said they expect equities to rise further around the first quarter earnings season, due to start in mid-April.
""We're starting to feel that while markets hate uncertainty, Trump's bark is worse than his bite when it comes to trade,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.
""It's earnings that's going to lift us off this bottom. It wouldn't shock me if we chopped around sideways for a little bit before earnings season ... The trade stuff is really a side show. We're waiting for real economic data like the jobs report Friday and for earnings. For now it’s going to be all about the technicals,"" he said.
The S&P opened below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, but inched above it as the session progressed, and by afternoon was in positive territory.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 230.94 points, or 0.96 percent, to close at 24,264.30, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 30.24 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,644.69 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 100.83 points, or 1.45 percent, to 7,042.11.
The turnaround marked the first time the S&P had showed gains for two consecutive days since early March.
Despite big swings in stocks, trading activity in U.S. equity options was muted as expectations for strong corporate earnings quelled the urge to load up on contracts that benefit from a surge in market volatility. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500, closed down 1.04 points at 20.06.
The technology sector (SPLRCT) rose 1.4 percent with only two of its stocks ending the day in negative territory including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which was pummeled after news its chief executive would testify in Congress over a data privacy scandal. It too closed well off its session low with a 0.6 percent drop to $155.10.
Boeing (N:BA) was the biggest drag on the Dow due to its exposure to China, and ended the day well off its session lows with a 1 percent decline to $327.44 after falling as low as $311.88. 
Farm machinery company Deere & Co (N:DE) ended down 2.9 percent at $148.57 as it could be hurt by China tariffs if its customers' exports are curbed. 
After being a laggard for much of the session, the S&P 500's industrials sector (SPLRCI) turned positive late in the day to close 0.4 percent higher.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 94 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.04 billion shares, compared with the 7.3 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

391,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>", Stocks- Wall Street Slumps as Trade War Simmers,"Investing.com – Wall Street was lower on Wednesday, as investors fear a trade war after China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on U.S. products.
The S&P 500 was down 29 points or 1.14% to 2,584.59 as of 9:38 AM ET (13:38 GMT) while the Dow composite decreased 432 points or 1.80% to 23,601.03 and tech heavy NASDAQ Composite fell over 76 points or 1.11% to 6,864.56.
The latest round of tariffs has prompted investor concern over a brewing trade war between China and the U.S. and increased tensions between the two biggest economies in the world.
On Wednesday China hit back at the U.S.’s proposed tariffs on high-tech and industrial Chinese products by targeting an additional 106 of U.S. goods, including soybeans, automobiles and aircraft. Over the weekend China slapped tariffs on 128 different U.S. products in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports announced in early March.
No date for the tariffs to go in effect has been announced.
Meanwhile technology stocks remain under pressure. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 1.76% while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) decreased 2.02% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dipped 3.78%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) inched down 1.38% while  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) slumped 6.13% after rising over 13% on Tuesday after its direct listing.
Elsewhere space incubator  Astrotech Corp  (NASDAQ:ASTC) rose 18.61% while  Eldorado Resorts LLC  (NASDAQ:ERI) increased 11.32%
In Europe stocks were down. Germany’s DAX fell 116 points or 0.94% while in France the CAC 40 decreased 38 points or 0.74% and in London, the FTSE 100 was down 29 points or 0.41%. Meanwhile the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 lost 29 points or 0.87% while Spain’s IBEX 35 slumped 83 points or 0.88%.
In commodities, gold futures rose 0.73% to $1,347.10 a troy ounce while crude oil futures decreased 1.95% to $62.27 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.17% to 89.70."

China's government plans to slap a 25% tariff on automobiles,  soybeans and chemicals, according to reports by Bloomberg. All told, the retaliatory response would be the equivalent of $50 billion worth of tariffs on more than 100 different American products.
The country's leaders said it would ""soon take measures of equal intensity and scale against US goods.""
China's response comes less than 24 hours after the US announced an initial list of the products that will be subject to roughly $50 billion in new tariffs. The list would impose tariffs on raw materials, construction machinery, agricultural equipment, electronics, medical devices, and consumer goods in China.
Trump had started the trade tiff after he announced he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum outside the US. However, trade groups like the American International Automobile Dealers Association warned against the move, saying it would make cars more expensive. 
""These proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports couldn’t come at a worse time,"" Cody Lusk, CEO of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, said in a statement on Thursday.
""Auto sales have flattened in recent months, and manufacturers are not prepared to absorb a sharp increase in the cost to build cars and trucks in America.""

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","If It's the Big One for Stocks, Hedgers Look Unprepared","(Bloomberg) -- Maybe the warnings got boring.
Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating, the Nasdaq 100 Index is set for its ninth straight 1 percent swing, and safe havens are in fashion around the world. Yet hedging activity is decidedly muted, all things considered.
By one measure, equity investors have been this disinterested in guarding against tail risks -- or an extraordinary spike in volatility -- only three other times in the past decade. The Cboe SKEW Index, which tracks the cost of out-of-the-money S&P 500 Index options, has been falling for the last two weeks, and is now two standard deviations below its average level. Another options-based gauge, the  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Fear Barometer, hit its lowest level since 2016 on Monday.
That’s not to say traders aren’t hedging at all. The Cboe Volatility Index remains above 20 -- a level it never reached in 2017 -- and is pushing higher as markets digest China’s latest retaliatory measures against proposed U.S. tariffs. But if rising trade tensions cause a massive volatility pick-up, investor insurance is scant.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). urged boosting protection after many S&P 500 hedges expired over the past three weeks.
“At face value, the current level of the Skew Index may represent a lack of concern around an imminent left-side ‘tail risk,’” Tim Emmott, executive director at Olivetree Financial Ltd. in London, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. “Sounds like a set up for quite the reverse for the medium term.”
Emmott points out that some of the de-leveraging may be due to the recent declines in U.S. stocks. Investors bought up protection in early March, and cashed out as the downside move materialized, he said. The last time the SKEW index tracked this low was the day the S&P 500 posted its worst selloff in more than six years, on Feb. 5.
To be sure, lows in the SKEW index have preceded VIX drops, not the other way around. The volatility benchmark has lost about 35 percent since Feb. 5 and fell in the month following SKEW lows in the past two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Caution is also missing in another corner of the market where traders bet against stocks and profit when they decline. Short sales as a percentage of total shares available for trading stood at 3.9 percent as of mid-March, according to the latest exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s below the three-year average of 4 percent and down from the peak of 4.4 percent reached after the market’s last 10 percent correction in 2016.

Beijing on Wednesday hit back against the Trump administration's plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, retaliating with a list of similar duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, whiskey and chemicals. The speed of China's move stunned financial markets.
Traders of soybeans, of which China is the largest importer, said they were bracing for mass cancellations of purchases, even though the United States is the country's second-largest supplier.
Buyers of propane used for making ethylene and propylene are looking to swap U.S. shipments for Middle Eastern barrels with buyers in South Korea and Japan.
""Even though we are committed to U.S. supplies, we could swap them for Middle East cargoes with Korean or Japanese buyers by paying them $10 per tonne extra freight cost,"" said a manager with an east China-based chemical plant that buys U.S. propane, and who gave only his surname, Zhong. 
China bought 3.56 million tonnes of U.S. propane last year worth some $2 billion, or 19 percent of its total imports of the product. 
The 25-percent additional tariffs will likely hit U.S.-based exporters such as Enterprise Product Partners (N:PSX) and Phillips 66 (N:EPD), and give a boost to rivals in the Middle East like Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
""The market will be thrown into some initial chaos and the freight market will also be affected. Diversions and swaps mean the demand for tankers will be lower, as U.S. voyages are shorter to northeast Asia and also shorter from the Middle East to China,"" said a senior dealer with Jovo Energy. 
The tariffs on beef were not expected to have much impact on the Chinese market, which had only resumed imports from the U.S. last year after a 14-year hiatus.
China bought just 2,200 tonnes of U.S. beef in 2017,  worth $14.7 million, according to Chinese customs, less than 1 percent of total imports. 

But the move could increase supplies of coveted high-end items like short ribs to other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, pressuring prices currently at record levels, said one expert who declined to be named.

LUTON, England (Reuters) - Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP) has unveiled plans to raise output at its British Vauxhall van plant, in a pre-Brexit show of confidence that will raise pressure on sister brand Opel's German workforce to offer concessions in labor talks.
PSA, which last year acquired Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors (N:GM), will build  Peugeot  and Citroen models as well as the next Vauxhall Vivaro van in Luton, north of London. Production will rise to 100,000 vehicles from 60,000 in 2017.
The French group, which is locked in labor talks with Opel's German workers, said the Luton investment was helped by ""responsible social dialogue with the Unite union guaranteeing production flexibility"", as well as UK government support.
The union said 350-400 jobs would be created as a result of the investment, which PSA said would amount to about 100 million euros ($123 million). Around 1,400 people are currently employed at the site, which is Britain's only van plant.
The announcement is a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of talks to decide Britain's long-term trading relationship with the European Union, although PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares underscored the need for free trade.
""I take on board the assurances that the UK government have provided us on seeking tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU going forward,"" he said at the plant on Wednesday.
""There is still work to do to ensure frictionless trade.""
The Vivaro, which currently shares underpinnings with  Renault 's (PA:RENA) Trafic van, will in future be assembled on PSA's EMP2 vehicle platform.
That will allow production of the Peugeot Expert and Citroen Jumpy to be introduced in Luton, the group said, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
After rescuing PSA from near-bankruptcy in 2013, Tavares is negotiating new union deals for Opel/Vauxhall as he pursues an ambitious restructuring plan designed to restore the division's profitability by 2020.
Raising pressure on Germany's IG Metall union, the division's German CEO Michael Lohscheller underlined that new deals had now been struck with workers in Britain, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Poland, allowing investment in their sites.
The latest UK investment safeguards the Luton plant's future for ""many years to come"", Lohscheller said on Wednesday.
PSA said it needed to boost van output to meet growing demand but could wait until 2020 to decide on future car production at its Ellesmere Port factory in northwest England, where the run of its current Astra Sports model does not end until the next decade.

The British government is contributing 9 million pounds to the van investment as part of its push to support the UK automotive industry, which employs over 800,000 people and generates revenue of 77.5 billion pounds ($110 billion).

LONDON (Reuters) - Losses on European exchanges steepened on Wednesday after China unveiled new tariffs against U.S. products, increasing concerns of an escalating trade standoff between the two countries.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index and Germany's exporter-heavy DAX hit a session low, down 1 percent and 1.4 percent respectively after China said it would impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on 106 U.S. goods. 
U.S. stocks futures also fell sharply. Nasdaq futures were down 2.1 percent, S&P 500 futures fell 1.6 percent and Dow Jones futures tumbled down 1.8 percent. 
The tension could also be felt on the Chinese yuan, which suffered its biggest daily fall versus the dollar in two weeks and through lower yields for top-rated U.S. and European government bonds. 
""China has taken out big guns to answer Trump’s tariff, the trade war is here"", Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said.
The European tech sector posted the worst performance with a fall of 1.6 percent, while cyclical stocks such as financials and industrials also weighed heavily.
WPP (LON:WPP) was among the biggest fallers at the open after the British advertising group said it was conducting an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive, Martin Sorrell, who denied any wrongdoing.
The shares gradually recouped some of their losses and were down 1.5 percent at 0856 GMT. 
Swiss Re was down 3.1 percent after the reinsurer said Japan's SoftBank was in talks to buy a stake which is unlikely to exceed 10 percent. 
Bloomberg reported on March 29 that SoftBank was looking to buy a 25 percent stake in Swiss Re, worth about $9.6 billion, as part of its drive to broaden its investments, which include its $93 billion Vision Fund for technology projects.

By Ghaida Ghantous and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DOHA - Qatar National Bank (QNB) (QA:QNBK) aims to increase its profit by 5-8 percent this year and loans and investments by 10-12 percent, helped by expansion into faster-growing Southeast Asia markets, its CEO told Reuters.
QNB, the largest bank by assets in the Middle East and Africa, is active in Egypt and Turkey and has made forays into Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Indonesia and China. 
""Our strategy and vision is to become among the leading banks in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. We have expanded our region to include Southeast Asia by 2020 and to be one of the main players in the Southeast Asia region,"" said Group Chief Executive Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari.
The bank reported a 6 percent rise in annual profit to 13.1 billion riyals ($3.59 billion) in 2017. 
QNB would look for markets that are growing faster than Qatar's growth of 2-4 percent a year, Chief Financial Officer Ramzi Talat Mari told Reuters. Potential acquisitions should control at least 4-5 percent of the local market and have an internal rate of return of no less than 15 percent within three years. 
Al-Kuwari said QNB had no plans to issue public U.S. dollar bonds in the near future despite still having room to do so under an approved program of up to $17.5 billion of international bonds, of which it has utilized only 60-70 percent.
""At the moment we don't need it, we are very liquid,"" he said.
QNB has recently used various types of debt instruments, including Kangaroo and Formosa bonds, to refill its coffers in an effort to diversify funding resources amid the embargo imposed on Qatar by other Arab states. QNB has borrowed over $2.3 billion through private placements this year. 
Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied gas, is planning to expand its capacity by almost a quarter to 100 million tonnes from the current 77 million by adding new trains as well as building new petrochemical units together with global oil majors and other partners. 
The projects are estimated to cost up to $40 billion and al-Kuwari said QNB would take an active role in lending to the new phase of Qatar's hydrocarbon boom, which is set to power its economy for the next few decades. 

""Qatar Petroleum has a lot of money... But in terms of financing, we want to take a bigger role in this. We are bigger now,"" he said.

Qatar's central bank said in December it had launched a legal investigation into attempts by countries opposed to it to harm the Qatari economy by manipulating the currency, securities and derivatives markets. 
Qatar National Bank (QNB) Chief Executive Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari said in an interview there had been unusual moves in Qatari CDS late last year. 
""The behavior was abnormal ... the way it was moving very fast, this is not normal behavior. The dust around the crisis settled after two months, but the CDS continued to go up for no reason,"" he said, estimating the Qatari CDS market at $21 billion.
Al-Kuwari said QNB was cooperating with the central bank in its investigation and had been ""supplying them with any information or data they asked us to supply them with.""
QNB, the Middle East's largest lender by assets, is 50 percent owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic boycott on Qatar last June, accusing it of backing terrorism, which it denies. The boycott led to the withdrawal of billions of dollars of deposits from Qatari banks.
Last month, Qatar's central bank asked U.S. regulators to investigate the U.S. unit of the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates, accusing it of ""bogus"" foreign exchange deals designed to harm its economy as part of a blockade by Gulf neighbors.
First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB), parent of the U.S. subsidiary, NBAD Americas, denied it had tried to manipulate the Qatari riyal.
The request for a U.S. investigation deepened the diplomatic crisis between Qatar, a major gas exporter, and its Gulf neighbors.
Asked if there was concern about further attempts to manipulate Qatar's economy, al-Kuwari said: ""This is a major offence. People will have to think about the consequences. And especially now with the legal case on the table, I assume people will think twice before going further into these actions.""
Al-Kuwari said that despite a substantial withdrawal of deposits at the start of the Gulf crisis in the middle of last year, deposits at QNB grew 13 percent for the whole of 2017. 
He said the trend will likely be sustained in the first quarter across the entire Qatari banking sector thanks to higher oil and gas prices and renewed confidence in the economy. 
Al-Kuwari said QNB had repaid a cash injection it received from Qatar's central bank at the peak of the crisis last year. 
He did not give the amount but said it represented a fair share among Qatari banks. He said the overall injection amounted to around $20 billion for the whole of the banking sector, half of which is controlled by QNB. 

Qatar was able to beat the crisis partly thanks to a big cash buffer of $350 billion in central bank reserves and assets at the Qatar Investment Authority, which include stakes in major companies including  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG).

The nominations for the supervisory board come amid questions over the leadership of the loss-making bank and the future direction of its investment banking division.
Deutsche Bank announced two other new nominees, Mayree Clark, founder and managing partner of Eachwin Capital, and Michele Trogni, previously group chief information officer at UBS (S:UBSG).
A fourth proposed member of the board, Norbert Winkeljohann, chairman of the management board of PricewaterhouseCoopers Europe, had previously been announced.
The proposed board members replace four retiring members. Shareholders are due to vote on the nominees at the bank's annual general meeting next month.
Gerd Alexander Schuetz, who represents the interests of the Chinese conglomerate HNA, a major shareholder, is also up for re-election for a five-year term.
""We are delighted to have been able to attract such highly qualified new members, each with many years of experience in the financial sector,"" Deutsche Chairman Paul Achleitner said in a statement.
""They will ideally contribute to the wealth of skills that our Supervisory Board brings together,"" he said.
The lender is in the throes of a leadership debate. People familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Achleitner has started the search for a replacement for Chief Executive John Cryan. But Achleitner has come under criticism from major investors for the bank's woes and the CEO search.
Thain was named head of Merrill Lynch in 2007 but resigned from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) soon after it bought the brokerage at the height of the financial crisis. He also previously served as chief operating officer at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), where Achleitner also worked earlier in his career.
Thain, who began his banking career in 1979, formerly headed the New York Stock Exchange and engineered a series of mergers that shaped it into NYSE Euronext by 2007.
Thain was appointed a director of Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] last year.
""The nomination of Thain underscores that investment banking, especially investment banking in the U.S., will remain core to the bank's strategy,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which holds Deutsche stock.
Deutsche Bank is conducting a global review of its investment bank, known internally as Project Colombo. It could result in the exit from or strengthening of certain activities.

JP Morgan weighed in on that debate on Wednesday with the publication of a research report for clients that said Deutsche should shrink its U.S. business to create shareholder value.

Schmidheiny, who owns 11.4 percent of the Franco-Swiss company, has decided not to stand for re-election as a board director but will remain a shareholder, it said.
The 72-year-old whose great grandfather Ernst Schmidheiny was one of the founders of its Swiss predecessor, joined the company in 1970 and was chief executive from 1978 to 2001.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>","Partners to rivals: Air New Zealand, Virgin Australia end seven-year alliance","By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) said it would end its seven-year alliance with  Virgin Australia  Holdings (AX:VAH), meaning the airlines will now compete head-to-head for passengers in the hotly competitive route between the two countries.
Under the alliance, the pair had coordinated their route network, flight schedules and pricing, but when the deal expires in October they will be free to pursue different strategies for the Australia-New Zealand sector, where more than 10 million seats are offered annually by airlines flying the route.
Virgin Australia said Air New Zealand had notified it of the end of the alliance, in which the Australian carrier was the smaller partner. Air New Zealand shares rose 4 percent and Virgin Australia shares fell by as much on the news.
Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti said in a statement that following the end of the alliance, his airline might deploy its low-cost arm Tigerair Australia on flights between Australia and New Zealand for the first time.
The Air New Zealand-Virgin Australia alliance had competed against a rival offering from Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Emirates that got a five-year extension in March. 
Emirates quit most flights between Australia and New Zealand as part of that renewed alliance, entrenching Qantas and Air New Zealand as the biggest players in the market.
As of May 2017, before the Emirates changes, Virgin Australia had a market share of 14.5 percent versus 33 percent for Air New Zealand and 31.6 percent for Qantas, according to data filed with Australia's competitor regulator.
Air New Zealand has been growing capacity at a faster rate than Virgin Australia, adding more widebody jets, as it tries to entice Australian passengers to use Auckland as a hub for flights to North and South America.
""The market has changed significantly as has our strategy and penetration in Australia,"" Air New Zealand Chief Revenue Officer Cam Wallace told Reuters.
The airline will look to improve its flight schedule when the alliance with Virgin Australia ends, he said.
Air New Zealand was once the largest shareholder in Virgin Australia, but it sold a 20 percent stake to Chinese conglomerate Nanshan Group in 2016 after becoming impatient with the Australian carrier's struggle to return to profitability.

Wallace said Air New Zealand would talk to Virgin Australia about offering codesharing or interlining arrangements on domestic flights in Australia ensure passengers retain access to destination options after the end of the alliance in October.

Amazon held early exploratory talks to buy control of Indian rival Flipkart but a deal with Walmart is more likely, daily newspaper Mint said on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
One person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the probability of a deal with Amazon was low, and that any such deal could spark monopoly concerns as Flipkart and Amazon dominate India's e-commerce market. The person declined to be identified as discussions were private.
Amazon declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.
Walmart is in talks to buy over 40 percent of Flipkart in potentially one of its biggest overseas deals, Reuters reported in February. A deal would give the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated to be worth $200 billion in a decade's time.
The deal would also represent a direct challenge to Amazon in Asia's third-largest economy. Amazon has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands into online grocery delivery.
Walmart will buy a majority stake in Flipkart through a mix of primary and secondary share purchases in a deal that could value the Indian firm at $21 billion, Mint reported.
Flipkart, founded by former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail market, ahead of Amazon, showed estimates by researcher Forrester.
Like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the pair began by selling books and diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones through exclusive flash sales. Flipkart now competes with Amazon on almost all product categories.
Flipkart's success has attracted a bevy of deep-pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management LLC, online marketplace eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and software maker  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings Ltd.

It was valued at around $12 billion when Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund bought roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion.

Jet Airways, in a filing to the stock exchange late on Tuesday, did not say whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.
Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.
The jets would be worth $8.8 billion at list prices, though airlines typically receive significant discounts from manufacturers.
Shares of Jet Airways rose as much as 3.2 percent in Wednesday morning trade, and were trading up 1.4 percent at 0610 GMT. The wider Mumbai market (BSESN) was up 0.25 percent. 
The latest agreement comes as Indian airlines rush to expand fleets to meet ever-increasing demand for domestic as well as international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia's third-largest economy.
Domestic passenger traffic increased 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier for the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, showed data from the International Air Transport Association.
Jet Airways Chief Executive Vinay Dube last month told reporters the airline was hoping to close the latest deal by the end of March.

The airline finalised a separate deal to buy 75 other Boeing 737 MAX aircraft last year.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 06:18AM ET</span>",Shares recoil as China fires back in U.S. trade war,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Share markets recoiled on Wednesday as a $50 billion retaliation from China in escalating trade tensions with the United States left investors reluctant to take positions in anything but the safest of assets.
The U.S. market had taken heart overnight from bets that President Donald Trump's Twitter attacks on online retail giant Amazon would not translate into actual policy.
Yet trade worries were never far away. Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of annual imports from China, covering around 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products.
China then responded within 11 hours with penalties on $50 billion of U.S. goods ranging from soybeans, cars and chemicals to whisky, cigars and tobacco with its Vice Finance Minister stressing the country had never given in to external pressure.
The moves triggered further heavy selling in global stock markets and commodities, with U.S. stock futures sliding 1.5 percent (N), soybean futures plunging 3.7 percent and the dollar and China's yuan both hit.
Europe's reaction was sour, too, with London's FTSE and Paris's CAC40 down around 0.5 percent, while the export-heavy German DAX was more than 1.3 percent weaker as the nervousness spread.
""The market should be focused on it because it's bad news,"" said fund manager Ashmore's head of research Jan Dehn.
""It (U.S. protectionist measures) is the policy equivalent of peeing in your pants to keep warm. In the short term it gives you a fuzzy feeling but in the long term, nothing good is going to come of it.""
The swing in risk sentiment put the pep back into bonds, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt down two basis points at 2.76 percent.
Borrowing costs nudged lower in Europe too even as the first March reading on euro zone inflation, a key release for markets as the European Central Bank looks to wind down its massive monetary stimulus, came in firm at 1.4 percent.
Benchmark issuer Germany's Bund yield slipped back under 0.50 percent, and just off 2-1/2 month lows hit last week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had spent most of its session dithering either side of flat before ending 0.3 percent lower. 
China's retaliation came after trading hours so Japan's Nikkei added 0.2 percent in thin volumes, Chinese blue chips eventually ending down. But it was South Korea that saw the big move as it dropped 1.4 percent.
EMini futures for the S&P 500 were also pointing to a sharply lower -1.5 to -1.8 percent New York open. (N) 
Wall Street had rallied on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season and the S&P 500 pushed back above a key support level. The Dow ended up 1.65 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent and the Nasdaq 1.04 percent.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares bounced 1.5 percent on reports the White House was not about to clamp down on its business model even as Trump continued his attacks on the online retailer.
FACTORIES FADE A LITTLE
The rising trade rhetoric saw the dollar buckle to 106.16 yen, after edging up from a low of 105.70 on Tuesday. The euro hovered at $1.2296, after easing from a top of $1.2335 overnight, while the dollar index was 0.2 percent lower at 90.
The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both held firm after hitting a nearly five-month and five-week highs respectively in recent day on growing optimism about the prospect of a NAFTA trade deal. 
Investors also seemed to be keeping their nerve on the global economic outlook after a host of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) showed some slowing, but from lofty levels in many regions.
Activity in Japan's service sector also grew at its slowest pace in 17 months last month, British shop prices dropped at the fastest pace in more than a year while Australian February building approvals fell 6.2 percent.
""If global PMIs slow and avoid overheating concerns, that is good for risk appetite. If they slow for ""the wrong reasons"" like trade protectionism, that is much more worrying,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) global strategist Alan Ruskin.
""The March data is at the most a very early warning shot for policymakers not to get too complacent on global growth resilience,"" he added.
Trade wars were a particular concern for developing Asia, where South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Indonesia, and India reported a slowing in factory activity.
In commodity markets, gold jumped 0.7 percent to $1,342 an ounce, recovering some of Tuesday's losses.

Oil prices slipped with Brent crude futures off 75 cents to $67.38 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 73 cents to $62.78 a barrel.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Manhattan first quarter office leasing slips but market remains strong,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leasing activity for office space in Manhattan slipped in the first quarter, but strong jobs growth has kept availability rates low, data showed on Tuesday.
New leasing fell 7.0 percent to almost 7.1 million square feet (660,000 square meters) in the first quarter, down from 7.6 million square feet a year earlier, with March the slowest month of the period, commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield reported.
Leasing activity slid 17.8 percent from a year ago and declined 22.5 percent from the fourth quarter, according to different data from brokerage Colliers International.
In part, that was because Twenty-First Century Fox and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) signed new and expanded leases totaling 1.2 million square feet at their Sixth Avenue headquarters in the first quarter of 2017 that lifted the comparative numbers for last year's period, Colliers said.
In addition, fourth quarter activity is generally higher than other quarters as brokers and tenants work to get deals done before the year's end, it said.
Jobs growth in Manhattan rose 2 percent over the 12 months to February, a rate that was higher than the state's 1.2 percent and the U.S. rate of 1.8 percent, the New York State Labor Department has said.
Office space availability has fluctuated around 10 percent in recent quarters, while sublet availability has been under 2 percent for a number of years, said Craig Caggiano, an executive director at Colliers.
The steady rate of availability despite more office space being added to the market has shown ""a remarkable recovery from our Great Recession lows,"" said Caggiano.
Average asking rents declined to $73.05 a square foot from $73.92 a year ago, but rose from $72.74 in the fourth quarter of 2017, Colliers said.
Since the market's trough in March 2010, asking rents have climbed 53.2 percent downtown, 49.2 percent in midtown south and 24.4 percent in midtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield. 
Building sales almost doubled to $5.2 billion from a year ago and from $2.58 billion in last year's fourth quarter as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed on its record-breaking $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market, Colliers said.
The average price per square foot paid for a Manhattan building going for more than $10 million was $890, up from $837 a year earlier, it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has taken a beating on the recent technology rout. But for short-sellers, it has been nothing short of a boon.
Short-sellers who placed bets that the shares of four big tech leaders, known as the FANG group, as spelled out by their first initials, were due for a fall have made more than $4 billion in profits over the last two weeks and more than $1 billion during the first two trading days in April, financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC said on Tuesday.
The FANG group is comprised of four closely watched internet stocks:  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL). 
Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, said he has been shorting Amazon shares because of ""the existential threat of regulation has surfaced and has deflated the FANG bubble. Importantly, it is a bipartisan regulatory and antitrust threat.""
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
""Social media's technological achievements and progress have outsped regulatory supervision and oversight,"" Kass said. He highlighted the recent discovery that information of about 50 million Facebook users had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica as he noted the potential jeopardy of the trust of users, which is ""a fundamental and necessary ingredient to future corporate success and measured in engagement.""
A strict new European Union law on data privacy takes effect on May 25. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters on Tuesday that the social network had no immediate plans to apply the law in its entirety to the rest of the world.
Governments are also taking action on other fronts. The European Commission last month proposed new rules to ensure that digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU. Kass also noted the European Union's record $2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google.
The overhang of increased government oversight has taken a bite out of the fortunes of large technology companies in the past.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) reached a settlement in an antitrust case with the Department of Justice in 2002 that lasted until 2011, contributing to a long period of underperformance that kept the stock below the high it reached in 1999 until 2016. Since then, the stock is up nearly 60 percent on the strength of its cloud-based services.
And not all short bets on tech stocks have been money makers. Some short-sellers have held their bets against the FANGs since the middle of 2017 and have yet to turn a profit.
Billionaire investor David Einhorn includes bets against Amazon and Netflix as part of his ""bubble basket."" While conventional wisdom suggests that recent turbulence in these stocks could have benefited short-sellers, Einhorn said the shorts did not perform as he hoped this year.
""We believe our investment theses remain intact. Despite recent results, our portfolio should perform well over time,"" Einhorn said in his quarterly letter to investors on Tuesday.

So far this year, Amazon shares are up over 19 percent and Netflix shares have soared nearly 48 percent. Alphabet and Facebook, however, are down year-to-date.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>","WPP investigates CEO Sorrell for alleged misconduct, which he denies","By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) is investigating an allegation of misconduct against Martin Sorrell, who has built the world's biggest advertising empire over more than three decades of relentless expansion.
Sorrell, who denies any wrongdoing, transformed WPP from a wire shopping basket maker through acquisitions of top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers and market-research and public-relations groups.
He said on Wednesday the allegation concerned financial impropriety, specifically the use of company funds. 
""I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognize that the company has to investigate it,"" the 73-year-old, one of Britain's best-known and highest-paid chief executives, said.
Shares in WPP, which said the allegation did not involve sums which were material to the company, fell to more than four-year lows and were down 2.1 percent at 1,094 pence at 1058 GMT.
The investigation will raise fresh questions about leadership succession at WPP, given Sorrell's dominance.
Chairman Roberto Quarta has previously said the board routinely discusses potential candidates should Sorrell leave, but no possible timeline has been publicly discussed.
Sorrell said his commitment to the group, in which he holds a 1.39 percent stake according to Reuters data, remained ""absolute"".
""As a significant share owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over thirty years ago, remains absolute - to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,"" he said. 
INDUSTRY SHIFT
WPP shares have fallen by 36 percent in the last year after consumer goods clients such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) cut ad spending, while digital companies Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) have encroached on its turf by forming direct relationships with brands.
The world's four top advertising groups are rethinking their models after growing through serial acquisitions of agencies which are often run as separate entities and designed to compete with each other to provide the best service.
But with technology changing advertising and consumer goods groups demanding cost savings, clients are increasingly wanting to work with one team who can provide a common proposal for media planning, creative ideas, data and analysis.
Meanwhile consultants like Accenture (N:ACN) are offering more marketing services, raising questions about the future role of the major ad groups.
Sorrell said a law firm was conducting the investigation, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, and he understood the process would be completed shortly.
""I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way,"" he added.
Sorrell has been richly rewarded, receiving payouts of 70 million pounds ($98 million) in 2015 - then the highest ever for a British executive - and 48 million pounds in 2016.
Some investors baulked at his rewards, with a third voting against the 2015 payout, but Sorrell's record was at the time enough to keep shareholders on side.
Sorrell said last month 2017 was ""not a pretty year"" for WPP, adding that he would accelerate a plan to simplify the group, which employs more than 200,000 people in 112 countries.
WPP's forecast for this year was more pessimistic than peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP).

460,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 11:59PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Facebook CEO stops short of extending European privacy globally,"By David Ingram and Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that he agreed ""in spirit"" with a strict new European Union law on data privacy but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world. 
As Facebook reels from a scandal over the mishandling of personal information belonging to millions of users, the company is facing demands to improve privacy and learn lessons from the landmark EU law scheduled to take effect next month. 
Zuckerberg told Reuters in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally, bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide, but the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide. 
""We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,"" Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate. 
His comments signal that U.S. Facebook users, many of them still angry over the company's admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members, could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans. 
The European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain. 
Shares of Facebook closed up 0.5 percent on Tuesday at $156.11. They are down more than 15 percent since March 16, when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica. 
PUSH FOR DATA PRIVACY 
Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success. 
""We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe,"" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, in Washington.
Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law, such as the ability of users to delete all their data, are already available for people on Facebook. 
""We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world,"" he said. ""The vast majority of what is required here are things that we've already had for years across the world for everyone.""
Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue. Both based in California, they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people. 
Google has declined to comment on its plans. 
When GDPR takes effect on May 25, people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks, for example. Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people's data, and they will need to get explicit consent. 
GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law.
Data is central to Facebook's advertising business, and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. 
""I haven't heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet,"" Wieser said. 
Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue. 
It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place, said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California. 

Companies' promises are less reassuring than laws, she said: ""If user privacy is going to be properly protected, the law has to require it.""

469,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 04:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Durable Goods Orders, ISM Non-Manufacturing, ADP Data on Tap
A raft of economic reports on services, private sector jobs and durable goods orders could dictate market direction Wednesday amid a recent lack of top-tier economic data. 
ADP nonfarm employment data, which often serves as a precursor to the monthly nonfarm payrolls data slated for Friday, is expected to show the private sector created 205,000 jobs in March, slightly below the 235,000 jobs created in the prior month.
The Institute of Supply Management’s Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index is expected to show a reading of 59.2 for March slightly below the previous reading of 59.5.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
A pair of reports on the durable goods and factory orders, meanwhile, will be closely monitored to assess whether recent tax cuts have encouraged spending.
On the monetary policy front, speeches by both St. Louis Fed President James Bullard at 09:45 a.m. ET, and Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta at 11:00 a.m. ET could offer an insight into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy measures.
The dollar tacked on gains against its rivals on Tuesday, as risk-on sentiment helped the greenback claw back some of its losses against safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
2. Fresh Inventory Data to Threaten Crude’s Relief Rally? 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the second straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 264,000 barrels in the week ended March 29 amid an ongoing rise in U.S. output, which hit a record 10.43 million barrels a day last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday at $63.51 a barrel as risk-on sentiment supported demand for riskier assets.
3. CBS, Viacom, Spotify In Focus
Shares of CBS and Viacom will likely draw special attention Wednesday after CNBC reported, citing sources, that CBS submitted a bid for Viacom that was below market value. 
The talks between the two companies reportedly hit a roadblock earlier in the session amid a squabble concerning who would lead the merged company.
The battle is between Joe Ianniello, the chief operating officer of CBS, and Bob Bakish, the CEO of Viacom, CNBC reported, citing the sources.
Shares of Viacom B Inc (NASDAQ:VIAB) closed at $29.42, down 3.7%, while CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) closed at $52.87, up 4.26%.
Elsewhere, investors are expected to continue to closely monitor Spotify after the music-streaming giant struggled to hold onto gains after making its public-listing debut Tuesday.
 Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) closed at $149.60, 13.3% higher from its reference price of $132, after hitting an intraday high of $169.
The streaming music service said in a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had 157 million active users and 71 million premium subscribers on Dec. 31, well above its closest competitor, Apple Music.
Spotify generated £4.09 billion in revenue in 2017, a 45% compound annual growth rate from the prior two years. Yet, it incurred losses of £1.24 billion last year, reporting a net-loss of £324 million and cash flow of £109 million."

The tax department had frozen the company's bank accounts last month for allegedly evading a dividend distribution tax of more than 25 billion rupees ($385 million) following a share buyback, according to reports in the Indian media.
The court asked the company to deposit 15 percent of the disputed tax, amounting to 4.9 billion rupees ($75 million) as security deposit till it decides on the case.
The company said the court further granted its request to address the tax department's collection actions and scheduled a hearing later in April 2018.

Cognizant shares were up nearly 1 percent in later afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

473,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. Oil Could Call the Tune With U.S. Markets Closed
U.S. stock and bond markets are closed Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday.
That could mean greater volatility for the commodities markets, which are still open, but will have much lower volume.
Oil will still likely have the most impact on equities as it continues to bounce around 3-1/2-year highs. Despite pledges for more output from major producers, demand will likely continue to outstrip supply in the near term.
WTI crude oil prices topped $75 per barrel for the first time since 2014 on Tuesday. But prices tumbled immediately after hitting that mark.
Unplanned supply stoppages from Libya, Venezuela and Angola, along with an outage at Canada's Syncrude upgrader that has strained North American markets, and U.S. sanctions against OPEC-exporter Iran, are leading some traders to bet that an OPEC agreement to increase output will be unable to fill in the void.
2. U.K. Services PMI Expected to Stay Strong
U.K. economic activity in the services sector should get the most attention on the economic calendar Wednesday. And economists expect the strong performance to continue.
The U.K. services PMI is expected to tick slightly down to 53.9 for June from a three-month high of 54 in May.
Any measure above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, while a measure below 50 indicates contraction.
A better-than-expected rise in services activity could put pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates when it meets August 2.
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee kept rates at 0.5% at its last meeting in June. But three of the nine members were in favor of a boost to 0.75%. Interest rates futures are pricing in a little more than a 50% chance of an August boost, according to Reuters.
MPC member Michael Saunders, who is considered more hawkish, said on CNBC TV that there is a case for a faster pace of rate increases.
""If the economy plays out as I expect, it may be that rates need to go up a little faster than (one rise over the next 12 months),"" Saunders said.
3. Keep an Eye out for Trade Barbs 
Although Wall Street won’t be open, the theme of trade talk controlling market sentiment could still continue.
Worries about an all-out trade war between the U.S. and its allies have been dictating a lot of trading direction.
The U.S. tariffs against China go into effect on Friday.
On Monday, the EU warned that potential U.S. vehicle tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy by imposing higher costs on U.S. manufacturers and said a 25% tariff would have an initial $13 billion to $14 billion negative impact on U.S. gross domestic product. The EU further warned that it would likely lead to counter-measures by its trading partners on $294 billion of U.S. exports."
474,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 03:16PM ET</span>",Apple discloses gender pay gap at UK operations,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Tuesday that men earned 5 percent more on average than women at its UK operations, although the median pay gap was 2 percent in favor of women. 
Apple's report comes a day before the deadline for British employers with more than 250 staff to report their gender pay gap under new regulations.
The iPhone maker said the gender pay gap was due to more men in senior positions than women which led to higher pay, bonuses and stock.
Apple said 30 percent of its workforce in the UK was represented by women, with the number having risen from 28 percent in 2014.
The company employs more than 6,000 workers in the UK and operates in three segments - Apple (UK) Ltd, Apple Europe Ltd and Apple Retail UK Ltd.

The company said it would take a number of measures to close the gaps, such as to stop asking employees for their salary history, which it will start from this year.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","Knorr, Wabtec settle with U.S. over agreements to not poach workers","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Knorr-Bremse AG and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp (Wabtec) (N:WAB) have agreed to scrap an illegal agreement to refrain from poaching each other's employees, the Justice Department said on Tuesday in announcing a settlement with the two rail equipment suppliers.
The two companies had agreed as early as 2009 not to recruit or hire each other's workers without prior approval, the department said. A third company, Faiveley Transport S.A., also participated in the agreement until it was purchased by Wabtec in 2016.
No-poach agreements are illegal under antitrust law since they restrict competition for employees, and potentially deprive workers of better job opportunities, the department said.
Wabtec said in a statement that it had settled even though it committed no wrongdoing.
""We firmly believe that our recruiting policies have been consistent with the antitrust laws and have in no way diminished competition for talent in the marketplace,"" the company said. ""We have elected to settle this matter to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation.""
The companies supply rail companies with train control, braking and door equipment for passenger rail vehicles. They are each other's top competitors, the department said in its complaint.

SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management revealed on Wednesday that it holds more than $1 billion worth of shares in key affiliates of South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Group and called for more rapid reform of the auto giant's governance.
It is Elliott's latest challenge to South Korea's family-run conglomerates after it forced  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) to increase shareholder returns in 2017, and comes amid a government campaign to boost investors' power in a country where shareholder activism is rare.
Elliott Advisors called for a ""more detailed roadmap"" as to how Hyundai Motor Group will ""improve corporate governance, optimize balance sheets, and enhance capital returns"" at  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330), Hyundai Motor (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270). 
The fund did not provide a breakdown of its stakes in Hyundai's three affiliates but its over $1 billion worth of shares account for around 1.5 percent of the total market value of the three firms. 
Hyundai Mobis shares jumped as much as 6.1 percent to their highest since Jan. 25 in the wake of the announcement. Hyundai Motor rose 4.9 percent, its highest in three weeks, while Kia Motors gained 3.8 percent in morning trade in Seoul, versus the broader market's (KS11) 0.13 percent fall.  Hyundai Glovis  (KS:086280) shares rose as much as 4.8 percent.
""I see Elliott's call as positive, as it should enhance shareholder value,"" said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management.
""Elliott has declared war against Hyundai but it has not made detailed demands, so further discussions need to be seen.""
Auto-to-steel giant Hyundai Motor Group announced a plan last week to streamline its complex ownership structure as it responds to calls from the government and investors for greater transparency and better governance at family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols.
But worries that the plan would benefit the parent group’s controlling family ahead of investors have hit the share prices of group companies such as parts supplier Hyundai Mobis.
While Elliott said it was pleased that Hyundai Motor Group had taken a first step toward reform, it added in a statement that ""more needs to be done to benefit the companies and stakeholders"". 
""Elliott looks forward to engaging with management and other stakeholders directly on these issues, and to offering recommendations regarding the proposed plan,"" the hedge fund said. 
Hyundai Motor Group responded that it was ""confident"" its restructuring plan would enhance shareholder value, and promised to communicate with investors at home and abroad. 
BATTLE WITH CHAEBOLS
Last year, South Korea's new antitrust chief told Reuters he had been in talks with Hyundai Motor Group about unwinding its circular shareholdings, which critics say give too much power to the controlling family at the expense of shareholders.
Under Hyundai's plan, Hyundai Mobis is to spin off its domestic module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with logistics affiliate Hyundai Glovis (KS:086280), which is personally backed by Hyundai's controlling Chung family.
But some investors complained that Mobis could be giving away the most profitable part of its business too cheaply. 
The plan is yet to be approved by shareholders. 
After the merger, Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo and his son Chung Eui-sun, who is vice-chairman, will buy stakes in Mobis held by other affiliates Kia Motors, Glovis and  Hyundai Steel  (KS:004020). 
The group has not announced when the family members would buy the Mobis stakes. 
Elliott's intervention is another headache for Hyundai, which is already struggling with slowing sales in China and the United States and Seoul's diplomatic row with Beijing last year.
Paul Singer's $33 billion firm Elliott Management is one of the few investors willing to take on South Korea's powerful chaebols.
In 2015 it narrowly lost its battle to block a merger of two Samsung Group affiliates that will allow the controlling Samsung family to consolidate their holdings ahead of a leadership transition. 
In 2016, Elliott called on Samsung Electronics to introduce a transparent holding company structure and pay a special dividend, among other demands. Samsung rejected the call for a holding company, but announced plans to cancel its existing treasury shares worth over $35 billion by 2018. 
Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Jay Y. Lee was later jailed for bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye in exchange for government support for a restructuring seen as advantageous to the controlling Lee family. 
The South Korean public has become increasingly angry at bad behavior by chaebol family members in the wake of the corruption scandal involving Samsung which led to the impeachment of Park last year.
Past foreign attempts to take on chaebol families include Sovereign Asset Management's unsuccessful bid to unseat SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won who was convicted of financial wrongdoing in 2003.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. states vow to defend auto fuel efficiency standards,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly a dozen U.S. states and Washington D.C. on Tuesday promised to defend federal automobile efficiency standards against a rollback proposed this week by Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
""All Americans ... deserve to enjoy fuel-efficient, low-emission cars and light trucks that save money on gas, improve our health and support American jobs,"" the attorneys general from 11 states said in a statement responding to Pruitt's proposal on Monday to ease the Obama-era standards.
The standards called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon. Proponents say they help spur innovation in clean technologies and cut emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.
California has long been allowed by an EPA waiver to impose stricter standards than Washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants. And 12 other states follow California's lead on cleaner cars.
The attorneys general, from states including New York, Iowa and Massachusetts, said they would challenge a rollback in court. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has already threatened to sue in defense of the standards. 
The statement, also signed by more than 50 mayors from around the country, said automakers have been making progress in meeting the national standards and that compliance costs have been lower than projected.
Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011 as part of a bailout deal. But they have urged Pruitt and President Donald Trump to revise the standards so it becomes easier and less costly to meet the targets.
Pruitt defended his decision at EPA headquarters on Tuesday.
""We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the progress we've made in reducing emissions as a country,"" Pruitt said. The EPA will make sure that U.S. consumers would not have to buy more expensive autos as a result of efficiency standards, he said.

Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma, a major oil producer, has been criticized by politicians after reports that he paid well below market rates to live in a condo owned by a lobbyist who deals with issues overseen by his agency. Trump and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly phoned Pruitt this week to say they support him, an administration source said on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), the world's largest manager of alternative assets, on Tuesday reported an average gender pay gap of 30 percent at its UK business, a rare insight into the private equity industry's wage disparities.
Blackstone said on Tuesday that the gap chiefly comes from men occupying the bulk of high-paying investment jobs at the firm.
""As these roles typically attract higher rewards than non-investment roles, this increases the average pay for male employees,"" New York-based Blackstone said. 
""In contrast, less than a fifth of our female employees are investment professionals and nearly three quarters are in support and administrative roles.""
The disclosure was made to comply with a UK government directive for employers with more than 250 staff to report their gender pay gap by April 4.
The disparity at Blackstone was far greater in bonuses, which often go to more senior employees, with a mean gap of 75 percent.
Blackstone said it was confident women and men were paid equally for equivalent jobs across its business. 
But the numbers underscore how private equity remains a male-dominated industry. 
Gender diversity has improved since private equity rose to prominence on Wall Street in the 1980s and Blackstone now staffs around 40 percent of its incoming analyst class with women, a source familiar with the matter said. Analyst classes can filter up into more senior positions. 
Nevertheless, top management at the largest firms, which include Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO), KKR & Co LP (N:KKR) and Bain Capital LLC, are largely male and the lack of diversity is often visible at industry events. 
Speaking at an annual private equity get-together in Berlin earlier this year, ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis joked, ""gender balance is an issue in this room"".
The #MeToo movement has also put new momentum behind efforts to have companies, especially in finance, disclose details about their workforce diversity.
 Citigroup  (N:C), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) last month all revealed large gender pay gaps in their British operations.

In January, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal. Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Pension fund leader presses Exxon for more climate details,"By Ross Kerber and Ernest Scheyder
BOSTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. pension fund manager said Tuesday it was pressing  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) for more details about its response to climate change, signaling that a key critic who elicited a report from the oil major last year remains unsatisfied with its answers ahead of the annual meeting this spring.
The questions came from New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who last year led a campaign that convinced a majority of Exxon shareholders to call on the company to detail risks it could face from rising global temperatures. 
Exxon produced a report in February outlining how global oil demand could drop sharply by 2040, but critics said the report fell short on areas like how climate policies could affect company finances.
Exxon has tried to placate investors by other means. At its annual investor day last month in New York, for instance, Exxon for the first time dedicated more than two hours to renewable technology investments and climate change.
In a letter to Exxon, shown to Reuters, DiNapoli's co-director of corporate governance Patrick Doherty called on Exxon to cut greenhouse gas emissions and sought details such as how its projections for fuel demand compare to national policy goals, or if Exxon considers health-based emissions standards in projections for fuel demand. 
In the letter Doherty wrote that his office needs answers for a ""full understanding of Exxon Mobil’s planning and preparation to operate in a carbon constrained economy and in a changing climate.""
Asked about DiNapoli's letter, Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said via e-mail that ""We value input from all of our shareholders.""
Separately, DiNapoli's office said on Tuesday it asked other companies including energy firms and utilities to reduce emissions and to address climate change risks. But staff withdrew resolutions at several U.S. energy firms after they agreed to provide climate risk details including at DTE Energy Co and at Dominion Energy Inc.
Exxon's annual proxy filing, likely to be released this month, will include ballot items for investors ahead of the company's shareholder meeting set for May 30 in Dallas.
A New York State fund overseen by DiNapoli, which has about 11.5 million shares of Exxon, withdrew a climate resolution for this year's proxy ahead of Exxon's February report.
In theory investors left unhappy by the time of Exxon's meeting could vote against individual company directors, though so far major investors who backed DiNapoli's proposal last year have declined to discuss their views.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor David Einhorn said on Tuesday he lost a lot of money in the first three months of 2018 and has no ready explanation for the loss, but is sure his portfolio can recover over time.
Greenlight Capital, one of the hedge fund industry's most closely watched firms, lost 13.6 percent so far this year, Einhorn wrote in a letter to clients dated April 3. Reuters saw a copy of the letter.
""No events or individual positions stand out,"" Einhorn said, adding that his losses were broad but shallow. The fund manager, who has been investing for more than two decades, again pinned some of his losses on the market's taste for growth stocks instead of the underpriced stocks he favors.
Investors are especially eager for a scorecard on how hedge funds have performed during recently turbulent times because many have long marketed themselves as being able to protect capital in all types of markets.
Research firm Eurekahedge said February, when markets began tumbling, delivered some of the steepest losses since the May 2010 flash crash. Most hedge funds are still tallying their performances.
Einhorn said markets did not process news rationally for long in the last weeks. On days there was news about companies ""more often than not the market prices followed reported results. The problem was ... all the other days,"" Einhorn wrote.
Despite the poor returns, Einhorn again stuck by his portfolio. ""Our investment theses remain intact,"" he said. ""Despite recent results, our portfolio should perform well over time,"" he added.
But at the moment even bets against companies that are designed to inoculate funds from heavy losses did not work out well, Einhorn acknowledged. Greenlight has been betting against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Shorts that exceeded expectations finished the quarter up 19 percent and stunningly, the shorts that missed expectations also finished up 5 percent.
Shorts pay off when the stock price falls.
Einhorn said he adjusted the portfolio by cutting exposures which helped avoid another 1.5 percent of losses. He lost money when he exited short bets against Swedish information technology company Hexagon and U.S. equipment rental company  United Rentals  Inc (NYSE:URI). But he made money on exiting chemical company Chemours Co at $31.62 a share after having bought in at $6.97 apiece. He also earned money on his bet on German energy company Uniper.

503,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Five Things to Know About the New York Fed's Incoming President,"(Bloomberg) -- John Williams was named Tuesday as the next president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, succeeding William Dudley. He brings with him monetary-policy chops, a long history at the central bank and some notable quirks.
Over the years, his public speeches have yielded a few key insights about the 55-year-old economist, who is taking over one of the most important roles in the global financial system. The job carries a permanent vote on interest-rate decisions and traditionally the vice chairmanship of the Federal Open Market Committee; a direct line to Wall Street’s biggest banks and brokers; and a front-row seat among international bank regulators. Williams, who currently leads the Fed’s San Francisco bank, starts in New York on June 18.
1. Hard to Label
Though he was viewed as a monetary-policy dove in the early days of his seven-year tenure at San Francisco’s helm, Williams was more recently labeled hawkish: mid-2016 found him pushing for two or three rate increases (the Fed made one) and in mid-2015 he was calling for two (the Fed made one that year as well). But his prescriptions were pretty consistent with what his colleagues were laying out in their quarterly economic projections, and that remains the case. Williams is currently saying three to four quarter-point rate hikes would be appropriate this year, which would place him smack in the middle of the forecast range that officials updated in March. He always emphasizes the importance of being data-dependent, and his views shift slowly.
As you might expect of a centrist, Williams has never dissented from a Fed decision.
2. Fed Veteran
Williams has spent almost his entire career at the Fed, as the timeline below shows. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen made him San Francisco’s research director when she was president of the regional bank, and he succeeded her into the top job in 2011. He’s co-authored influential work with two of the most widely-cited researchers within the Fed system: Thomas Laubach, now director of the Fed Board’s monetary affairs division, and David Reifschneider, formerly Yellen’s personal economic adviser.
3. R-star and the Rethink
Fed officials have increasingly leaned on the concept of a “neutral” interest rate in their communications about their policy strategy. The idea is that interest rates will stimulate economic growth until they are raised above the neutral rate, which is known in the economics lingo as “r-star.” And Williams literally has his name on it: the formula he originally developed in a 2001 paper with Laubach is the most commonly-cited estimate of the neutral rate.
The Laubach-Williams model suggests the neutral rate has fallen significantly since the financial crisis, and may not be going back up again any time soon. That’s why Williams has become increasingly associated with another big idea shaping the policy debate at the moment: if the neutral interest rate is so much lower now than it was historically, maybe the Fed should consider raising its inflation target. Higher inflation would lead to higher interest rates than otherwise, which would allow the Fed more room than they have now to cut rates in response to future economic downturns.
4. Not a Banker
Williams’s past doesn’t include stints in the financial industry. That could help him avoid a frequent criticism: that Fed officials are too close to the firms they oversee. That complaint was sometimes levied against Dudley, who came to the central bank from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
But a lack of banking ties may have drawbacks. The New York Fed president sits at the intersection of financial markets and the economy, communicates regularly with the largest banks in the U.S., and, in Dudley’s case, brought real-world experience to the position. Williams likes to make the point that he doesn’t have a Bloomberg terminal on his desk -- the implication being that he goes out of his way to avoid paying attention to short-term swings in the markets.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it will probably have to change for a role that oversees Wall Street. The last New York Fed president to make a similar leap was Gerald Corrigan, who moved from the Minneapolis Fed to the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 1985.
5. Quirky Character
Williams, who waxed romantic on the benefits of island garb during a recent appearance in Hawaii, likes to give speeches filled with song references -- rock band Green Day is one example -- which is pretty unusual for a Fed official. He also loves to play video games (Dark Souls is his favorite) and he’s an avid fiction reader.
Another fun fact: John Taylor -- a vocal critic of Fed policy in recent years who’s also famous for creating a widely-used monetary-policy rule -- was Williams’s thesis adviser at Stanford University, where he earned his Ph.D. Williams, who’s married with two sons, is originally from Sacramento, and his father served as an adviser to four consecutive California governors.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 02:33PM ET</span>",Two major investors criticize Deutsche Bank chairman over CEO search,"By Oliver Hirt and Tom Sims
ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two major  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) investors on Tuesday criticized Chairman Paul Achleitner over the bank's performance and his handling of a search for a new chief executive.
Last week, Reuters and other news organizations reported that Achleitner had begun a search for a new CEO to replace John Cryan. Cryan has said he will stay on in a memo to staff, but Achleitner has so far remained silent.
At the heart of the debate over the bank's leadership is the future of the investment bank. 
Confidence in Achleitner has been damaged, said a major shareholder. ""He makes too many excuses for strategic mistakes that fall under his responsibility,"" the person said on condition of anonymity. 
Another major investor said: ""The situation is a bit odd. Achleitner is obviously not controlling the process. All is a bit chaotic at the moment.""
Both Cryan and Achleitner have been criticized for Deutsche Bank's share price and earnings. But Achleitner, rather than Cryan, should take the blame, said the second shareholder, who also declined to be named.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Achleitner or Cryan's behalf.
A third major investor, also speaking anonymously, came to Achleitner's defence. Asked about sentiment turning against Achleitner, the investor said: ""No, this is spin"".
The bank's largest investors are Qatar's royal family, Chinese conglomerate HNA, U.S. asset manager BlackRock and private equity fund Cerberus. Together they own about a third of Germany's largest bank, which employs more than 97,000 people.
In a March 28 message to staff made public by the bank, Cryan – whose term ends in 2020 - sought to quell talk of an imminent exit and of disagreements between him and Achleitner, saying he was ""absolutely committed"" to serving the bank.
Much of the shareholder discontent focuses on the lack of clear progress at the bank, which has reported three consecutive years of losses under Cryan. Its shares have lost 30 percent of their value since the beginning of the year. 
Cryan has slimmed down Deutsche's investment bank but it has failed to return to growth. Revenues are 25 percent lower than they were in 2015 and a string of top bankers have left.
""It looks like there is some dispute or discussion at the board level about what is going to be the future of the investment bank,"" said a fourth person with direct knowledge of the thinking of one of the bank's biggest investors. 
""It is the question of more investment in the platform or more divestment from the platform,"" the person said, saying this was a ""crucial question to resolve."" 
Cryan is conducting a global review of the investment bank which could result in further job cuts or investment.
Supporters of Cryan, which include some shareholders, credit him with settling a string of legal disputes from Deutsche Bank's reckless expansion during the financial crisis, strengthening its balance sheet and pulling off the listing of the bank's asset management arm. 
But Cryan himself has said turning the bank around will require time. Last month, it reported a bigger 2017 loss than previously disclosed, warned it would miss a cost-cutting target this year, and said a strong euro coupled with higher funding costs would weigh on its first quarter results. 

""There has been a steady flow of negative news on Deutsche Bank, but if you look at it closely, they've been making progress,"" Peter Nerby, an analyst at credit rating agency Moody's, said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has exempted one of the nation's largest oil refining companies, Andeavor (N:ANDV), from complying with U.S. biofuels regulations - a waiver historically reserved for tiny operations in danger of going belly up, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The exemption, which applies to the three smallest of Andeavor's ten refineries, marks the first evidence of the EPA freeing a highly profitable multi-billion dollar company from the costly mandates of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The law requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline or purchase credits from those who do such blending.
The decision, which has not been previously reported, raises the question of whether other big and profitable oil firms with small refineries - such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) - also have or could receive the waivers, which are granted by the EPA in secret. 
Such waivers were designed for refineries producing less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate that they suffer a ""disproportionate economic hardship"" from the costs of RFS compliance.
Andeavor posted net profits of about $1.5 billion last year.
The EPA exemption, granted about a month ago, could reduce Andeavor's regulatory costs by more than $50 million this year, based on the number of biofuels credits that two brokers say the refiner recently sold into the market, along with previous disclosures by firms that own refineries of a similar size.
Biofuels credit prices tied to ethanol dropped by 6 cents, to 38 cents each, after Reuters reported Andeavor's exemption, traders said. Andeavor shares jumped by more than 1 percent on the news, hitting a session high of $102.78.
Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, reacted to the report by calling the exemption an ""outrageous abuse"" of the law.
""Providing a small refiner waiver to a company like Andeavor is laughable and abandons the commitment of President Trump to protect the RFS,"" he said in a statement.
The exemption releases the firm of its obligation to provide the EPA with biofuels credits proving compliance at the three refineries - two located in North Dakota and one in Utah - for the year 2016, which would have come due this year, the sources said. Andeavor is also asking EPA for a waiver for its 2017 obligations for the same refineries, but has not yet received a decision, the sources said.
Andeavor spokeswoman Destin Singleton declined to comment. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately comment in response to Reuters inquiries on Monday and Tuesday.
As a matter of policy, the agency refuses to release any information on the waivers, or to name their recipients, citing concerns over disclosing private business information. The EPA denied a Freedom of Information Act request from Reuters seeking information on companies receiving the waivers.
Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to meet the barrel-per-day standard, as does billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn - whose efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program drew scrutiny from federal investigators. 
Icahn, majority owner of refiner CVR Energy (N:CVI), had served as an advisor to Trump on regulatory issues during his push to reform biofuels regulations early last year, but he resigned amid allegations that the role gave him a conflict of interest.
Spokespeople for all four companies declined to comment on whether they had applied for or received any exemptions.
The lucrative waivers are typically only reported if a publicly-traded firm considers them to be material to their financial or operational performance, in which case they must disclose the information through Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
The RFS has long been a lightning rod of conflict between the corn lobby, which supports the policy as an engine for demand, and refiners who say it costs them a fortune.
The White House has sought to broker a deal between two of its key political constituencies in a series of meetings, but the effort has failed to yield policy changes acceptable to both sides.
Ethanol industry advocates argue exemptions for refiners undermine the intent of the law, originally designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign oil and boost farm economies.
While the EPA's motives in providing hardship waivers are unclear, the exemptions are one of the tools at the administration's disposal to ease financial pressure on refiners without undertaking a reform of the RFS policy.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt, appointed by Trump, has repeatedly said the RFS is too costly to oil refiners and should be overhauled. But Trump's Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, told an agriculture conference in February that Trump ""stands with corn farmers, biofuels farmers and the RFS,"" according to a recording heard by Reuters.
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a question about whether the administration was expanding the use of the RFS waivers to help refiners. Bowman, of the EPA, also did not comment on the question.
LAWSUIT OVER 'HARDSHIP' STANDARD
Andeavor's waiver follows a successful lawsuit by another refiner, Sinclair Oil, last year challenging the strict standard the EPA has used under past administrations for determining financial hardship.
""The EPA's interpretation takes the statutory language too far,"" wrote Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. ""A 'hardship' is something that makes one's life hard or difficult - not just something that makes continued existence impossible.""
The lawsuit - along with a perception that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to refiners - has sparked a big increase in applications from refining firms for he exemptions this year. More than 30 refineries have sought the waivers, according to sources familiar with the matter.
In a typical year, the EPA would receive about 12 to 15 requests for hardship exemptions and would grant about half of them, a former official familiar with the program told Reuters.
EXEMPTIONS SAVE REFINERS BIG BUCKS
Andeavor sold some 100 million of those credits to its competitors in recent weeks, according to two brokers in the biofuels credit market. The company otherwise would have needed to provide those credits to the EPA to prove compliance with the RFS.
Those credits would be worth about $58 million based on a Reuters calculation of average renewable fuel RIN prices this year.
In the past, other companies have said the exemptions they were granted saved them tens of millions of dollars, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
Last year, for example, HollyFrontier disclosed a reduction of almost $58 million in its costs of credits for two refineries for 2016.
Refiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance.

540,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>","Trump Friend or Foe, Amazon and Sinclair Slump Amid Tweet Storm","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s been expressing support for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., but that hasn’t insulated the conservative-leaning broadcaster from a wider market slump.
Sinclair dropped more than 4 percent on Monday after Trump defended the Maryland-based company. That’s roughly the path taken by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which plunged 5.1 percent Monday on a series of negative tweets by the president.
The lesson may be that Trump’s tweets don’t change the expectation that Sinclair will win federal permission to buy more TV stations, while traders see Trump’s animosity as holding real potential to damage Amazon. The online retailer could be vulnerable to an antitrust probe or a hike in postal rates.
“Neither President Donald Trump’s tweets nor a recent popular video about Sinclair’s sometimes centrally driven broadcast-news practices is likely to impact the FCC’s review of the Sinclair-Tribune deal,” Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note Tuesday morning assessing Sinclair’s path before the Federal Communications Commission. The agency is one of two vetting Sinclair’s proposed $3.9 billion purchase of Tribune Media Co. television stations, including outlets in New York and Chicago. Tribune dropped 1 percent Monday.
Trump has unleashed a barrage of tweets accusing Amazon of not paying enough in taxes and underpaying the U.S. Postal Service. The online retailer was the biggest drag on the equity benchmark Monday, a position its held for a week as it plunged 12 percent since Axios reported that the president was “obsessed” with regulating the company.
On Tuesday, Trump described several U.S. news outlets as ""fakers"" afraid of increased competition from Sinclair. A day earlier, he defended Sinclair from critics who focused on the company’s news readers in scattered cities reading identical texts.
Both Sinclair and Amazon opened higher on Tuesday before dropping again."

The commission's final phase determination followed a Commerce Department move in February to add anti-dumping duties of 60.44 percent to 276.65 percent to already steep anti-subsidy duties on imported biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia.
The independent panel had already found in the subsidy cases that the imports caused such injuries.
The latest duties make it virtually certain that biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia will not be sold in the U.S. market, with combined rates of up to 159 percent on the Argentine fuel and up to 341 percent on Indonesian variety. 
The trade case was filed by the National Biodiesel Board and 15 member companies that alleged a flood of subsidized imports sold below fair market value was preventing U.S. producers from earning an adequate return.
The vote marked the last procedural hurdle before final antidumping orders can be issued this month, the board said in a statement.

""This vote today finalizes the case to address the harm that unfair trade practices have had on the U.S. biodiesel industry,” said Donnell Rehagen, the board's chief executive officer. ""Foreign producers dumping product into American markets below cost has undermined the jobs and environmental benefits that U.S. biodiesel brings to the table.""

552,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:19PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Gazprom set to gain EU antitrust approval with concessions - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee and Alissa de Carbonnel
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Gazprom (MM:GAZP) are poised to settle a long-running antitrust case after the Russian gas company agreed to price reforms and to allow rivals to gain a foothold in eastern Europe, people familiar with the matter said.
A decision by the European Commission could come as early as this month although the timing could still slip, the people said. A settlement would allow Gazprom to avoid a possible fine of as much as 10 percent of its global turnover.
The seven-year-old case underlines the rocky relationship between Europe and Russia, which have clashed over Ukraine, Syria and, most recently, a nerve attack against a former Russian spy living in England that resulted in expulsions of diplomats on both sides.
Last year, state-owned Gazprom, which supplies a third of the EU's gas, offered to link prices to benchmarks such as western European gas market hubs and border prices in France, Germany and Italy, and allow price reviews every two years.
This aimed to address complaints of excessive pricing in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland vis-a-vis German prices due to Gazprom's policy of locking clients into decades-long, oil-indexed contracts. 
The company also pledged to scrap all contractual restrictions which bar clients from reselling its gas and let the Bulgarian transmission network operator take charge of the Balkan country's gas flows to Greece.
Gazprom will drop its $70 million claim for damages from Bulgarian partner BEH following the 2014 cancellation of the South Stream gas pipeline project that would have shipped Russian gas under the Black Sea via Bulgaria to central Europe. 
Gazprom has tweaked its original proposal on concessions after negative feedback from EU countries and customers but the main elements remain unchanged, according to a recent draft seen by Reuters.
Revisions have been mainly technical such as lower service fees charged by Gazprom which could result in its clients saving millions of euros. The concessions are expected to apply for eight years and be monitored by a trustee.
Both the Commission and Gazprom declined to comment.
The EU competition enforcer has rejected a complaint by state-run Polish oil and gas company PGNiG (WA:PGN) which wants Gazprom to sell its controlling stake in companies that own key gas infrastructure in the EU, including the Jamal-Europe gas pipeline, two other sources said.
The EU had previously said this was not covered by the bloc's antitrust rules because it was a bilateral deal between the Polish and Russian governments.
Gazprom found itself in the EU antitrust crosshairs in 2011 after regulators raided about 20 offices of its customers in eastern and central Europe, seizing more than 150,000 documents. 

At issue was whether Gazprom had imposed unfair prices by linking gas price to oil prices, divided up gas markets by hindering the free flow of gas across EU countries and prevented the diversification of the supply of gas.

(Reuters) - The billionaire Steven A. Cohen has won the dismissal of an $8 billion lawsuit accusing him and his former firm SAC Capital Advisors LP of conspiring with other hedge funds to spread false rumors about Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd, hoping to ""crush"" or ""kill"" the insurer.
In a decision last week, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Frank DeAngelis said the nearly 12-year-old case did not belong in that state's courts because there was no evidence SAC expected or intended to cause injury there while ""conspiring to drive down the share price of a Canadian company.""
Fairfax claimed it was victimized by a four-year ""bear raid"" by hedge funds that engineered bogus accounting claims and biased analyst research, and persuaded reporters to write negative stories about the Toronto-based insurance and investment management company.
It said the funds did this to profit from short sales, or bets its stock price would fall. Fairfax claimed that hedge fund operatives ran the bear raid from New Jersey.
Neither Fairfax nor its lawyers were immediately available for comment on Tuesday about the decision, which is dated March 29. A spokesman for Cohen and his current firm, Point72 Asset Management LP, had no immediate comment.
Last April, a New Jersey state appeals court had revived conspiracy, disparagement and other Fairfax claims that had been dismissed in 2011 and 2012 against several defendants.
But it dismissed claims against two New York hedge fund firms, Jim Chanos' Kynikos Associates PC and Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, saying it lacked jurisdiction, and rejected racketeering claims against all defendants.
Point72 is based in Stamford, Connecticut. It was freed three months ago to handle outside money following a two-year ban by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said Cohen failed to supervise a portfolio manager who conducted insider trading at SAC.

The case is Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd et al v. SAC Capital Management LLC et al, Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris County, Nos. MRS-L-2032-06, MRS-L-5000-06.

555,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>","Strong economy, discounts boost automakers U.S. March sales","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday reported higher new vehicles sales for March on the back of a strong U.S. economy and big consumer discounts, sending shares in Detroit's automakers up.
Industry sales in March rose 2.5 percent to 1,653,529, according to Autodata, which said the seasonally adjusted annual rate for the month was a better-than-expected 17.5 million versus 16.8 million a year ago. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a March SAAR of 16.9 million.
General Motors Co (N:GM) posted a 16 percent jump in new vehicle sales from the previous March, led by a 14 percent increase in higher-margin retail sales to consumers.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (FCA) reported a 14 percent increase and said it saw a 45 percent spike in sales of its popular Jeep models, giving the brand its best sales month on record.
The strong results for March followed a weak performance in February. 
Last year, U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent after hitting a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Sales are expected to fall further in 2018 as interest rates rise and push up monthly car payments. Also, millions of nearly new vehicles will return to the market this year after coming off lease, providing a lower-cost alternative for consumers.
GM notched double-digit sales increases across all brands in March, particularly for its SUV and pickup truck models.
""March was an exceptional month for us,"" GM's U.S. head of sales Kurt McNeil said in a statement. ""A growing economy and strong new products helped us execute a very successful plan to conquest customers from other brands.""
While GM said its average transaction price was up $900 in the first quarter, the company's consumer discounts as a percentage of transaction prices hit 14.5 percent in March.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said earlier on Tuesday it will stop reporting monthly U.S. vehicle sales, saying the 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect the market and will instead issue quarterly sales. 
Other automakers have not yet said whether they will follow suit.
Industry analysts consider discounts of over 10 percent to be unhealthy as they undermine resale values and erode profits. 
When issuing a March sales forecast last week, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said industry wide discounts in the first half of the month were at 10.3 percent.
Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, said the impact of the recent U.S. tax overhaul tax ""may now be kicking in and lifting the market above previous expectations.""
""Our expectation is that more interest rate increases will occur in 2018 and the resulting higher monthly payments will, eventually, slow the current pace,"" he said. 
FCA's retail sales to consumers outstripped those of No. 2 U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F). But FCA also saw a 22 percent increase in lower-margin fleet sales to rental car companies and government agencies. Over the past year FCA has pursued a policy of cutting fleet sales. 
Ford reported a 3.4 percent increase in overall sales for March, led by an 8.7 percent rise in fleet sales. Retail sales were up just 0.8 percent in the month, but Ford said sales of its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks were the best since 2000. 
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported a 3.5 percent increase in sales in March, with double-digit increase in SUV and pickup truck sales offsetting a 6.1 percent decrease in sedan sales. Sales of the company's completely revamped flagship Camry sedan fell 1.1 percent.
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said its March sales rose 3.8 percent, thanks largely to SUV and pickup truck sales. The automaker's new Accord sedan saw a 9.9 percent sales decrease.
U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned passenger cars in favor of more comfortable, higher-margin SUVs and pickup trucks.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) bucked the trend for the month with a 3.6 percent decline in sales, led by an 8.9 percent drop in sedan sales.

In afternoon trading, GM shares were up 2.8 percent at $36.75, while FCA shares jumped 9 percent to $21.75, and Ford shares were up 2.4 percent at $11.13.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest American business lobby group came to the defense of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Tuesday after a multi-day Twitter attack by U.S. President Donald Trump that included unsubstantiated criticism of the world's biggest online retailer.
The value of Amazon (O:AMZN) shares held by Jeff Bezos, the online retailer's chief executive and single largest shareholder, had taken a $10 billion hit in the week since Trump began attacking him and his company on Twitter.
Citing an unspecified report, Trump told reporters at the White House that the company was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate, and that it was costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars and forcing other retailers out of business, and he threatened to raise rates.
Late on Tuesday afternoon, a source familiar with proceedings at the White House said no specific actions addressing Trump's concerns about Amazon were on the table at the White House at this time, but that could change given Trump's dissatisfaction with the company. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the country, stepped in on Tuesday to defend Amazon, which is a member.
""It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,"" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, citing the value of the free enterprise system and the rule of law. ""The record is clear: deviating from those processes undermines economic growth and job creation.”
It is not the first time Trump, or another U.S. president, has been publicly critical of a company. Trump has previously criticized automakers, Carrier Corp, which is owned by United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
In 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company  Staples Inc  (NASDAQ:SPLS) for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Trump has progressively escalated his criticism of Amazon and Bezos, who also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president.
Bezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday's market close.
Amazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump's latest Amazon-related tweet.
Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he has offered no evidence to back up his criticisms.
""The post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. ""If you look at the cost that we're subsidizing, we're giving a subsidy to Amazon.""
Trump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS.
Amazon also ships packages through providers such as FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) as well as its own experimental shipping service.

Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump's tweet on Tuesday and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.

Bulk of the company's vehicle sold came from a 44 percent jump in sales for the Jeep brand and a 6 percent rise in sales for Ram brand of vans and trucks.

In the United States, the company's sales rose 14 percent to 216,063 vehicles for the month.

560,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Detroit Automakers' March Deliveries Trounce Analyst Estimates,"(Bloomberg) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and  Ford Motor Co . (NYSE:F) all reported a bigger-than-expected bump in March sales as more aggressive industry discounting gave carmakers a boost.
GM said its March sales surged 16 percent, triple the gain analysts had been expecting. Ford’s light-vehicle sales rose 3.5 percent, outpacing the 0.8 percent gain analysts had been forecasting.
“March represented a strong start to the spring selling season for both Ford and the industry,” Mark LaNeve, U.S. sales chief at Ford, said in a statement.
Fiat Chrysler boosted car and light truck deliveries by 14 percent, beating analysts’ average estimate for a 1.9 percent increase. Sales for the Jeep sport utility vehicle brand soared 45 percent, driven by a more than six-fold surge for the compact Compass.
Most automakers were expected to report small increases for March, which had one more selling day than the year-earlier month. The annualized pace of sales, adjusted for seasonal trends, was probably about 16.8 million vehicles. That would match the rate in March 2017 and would be the weakest since Hurricane Harvey ravaged dealerships across the Texas Gulf Coast in August.
“Healthy first-quarter numbers indicate the industry is on solid ground, but that doesn’t mean we can expect another banner year for new car sales,” Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. “We could potentially see sales start to tumble in the high-volume summer months when shoppers aren’t seeing the deals they are looking for.”
Ford sales rose more than expected on a surge in deliveries of F-Series pickups and an 8.7 percent rise in sales to fleet buyers, such as daily rental companies.
GM is throwing a wrench in the industry sales reporting process by announcing a plan to end a 25-year-long practice of disclosing monthly results and shifting to quarterly releases. Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations, said the move will better separate “real” demand trends from “short-term fluctuations.”
The switch by GM comes as analysts widely expect industrywide deliveries to slump for the second year in a row after an unprecedented seven-year growth spurt. March may have been the first month this year that retail sales rose from a year earlier, according to Thomas King, senior vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power.
“While this breaks a streak of three consecutive months of decline, the industry is boosted by a quirk in the calendar due to an additional selling weekend,” he said.
Incentive spending likely helped buoy sales last month, with average discounts rising $74 from a year ago to $3,849, J.D. Power said. That was driven by deeper discounting on trucks and SUVs -- up $160 per vehicle from a year ago -- in an increasingly crowded market.
“We will be watching the pickup truck segment carefully in March, as the new full-size Ram pickup has gone on sale while the new Chevrolet truck has not,” Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement. “There is strong brand loyalty in this segment and lots of interest in new product, so it will be telling to see how Chevy manages the transition to the new truck. Also, we know Ford is using aggressive incentives to defend their leadership position.”

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sought to squash any speculation it might need to raise more capital this year on Tuesday, driving the company's battered shares higher as it announced it built 2,020 of its cheaper Model 3 sedans in the last seven days.
Tesla shares jumped as much as 6.9 percent in morning trade, recouping a third of its losses from a week dominated by bad news about its credit rating and a crash involving a car using its semi-autonomous driving technology.
But with the company again missing its own 2,500 target for weekly production at the end of the first quarter, doubts remained among analysts and fund managers about Tesla's ability to keep production growing to a promised 5,000 Model 3s per week in three months time.
Musk's $50-billion dollar company, involved in a raft of projects ranging from trucks to a Roadster sports car and a factory in China, said it would also churn out 2,000 of the Model 3 cars next week and promised output would climb rapidly through the second quarter.
The Model 3 is the most affordable of Tesla's cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker into a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.
""(Tesla is) laying the groundwork for Q3 to have the long-sought ideal combination of high volume, good gross margin and strong positive operating cash flow,"" the company said in the filing. 
""As a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines.""
Jefferies analysts had estimated that Tesla needed $2.5 billion to $3 billion of fresh equity to fund the Model 3 ramp-up and several other Wall Street brokerages have predicted the company would need more funds this year to fund its wide range of technology initiatives.
SKEPTICS
Some analysts said there were signs that the company might have prioritized the cheaper car, seen as crucial to its profitability, over its Model X SUV and more-established and expensive Model S sedan.
Last week,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson warned investors to be wary of a brief ""burst rate"" of Model 3 production that was not sustainable. 
""Tesla may have stockpiled batteries amid Fremont downtime, allowing production to be higher in the final week of 1Q,"" Johnson wrote. ""Any such 'beat' is unlikely to be sustainable, and questions remain on Tesla's ability to sustainably reach 2,500/week, let alone 5k/week.""
First-quarter deliveries totaled 29,980 vehicles, out of which 11,730 were Model S and 10,070 were Model X. Both were lower from the previous quarter and the first quarter a year ago.
""Maybe Elon Musk switched staff from Model S and X to Model 3 to get better production numbers for Model 3,"" said analyst Frank Schwope from NORD/LB.
While Tesla had promised to reach 2,500 cars per week in the first quarter which ended March 31, the Model 3 weekly numbers it gave were for the seven days to April 2. Tesla declined to give production figures for the week to March 31. 
Tesla shares peaked at $389 last September and have been declining steadily since, but analysts continue to give the company the benefit of the doubt as a big bet on the future of high-tech electric and self-driving vehicles.
Meanwhile, investors raised their bets against Tesla shares by 10 percent since mid-March, according to data provided by S3 Partners LLC on Tuesday, betting the market has misjudged the electric car maker's prospects.
Musk himself has taken direct control of Model 3 production and the company says it already has about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the car.
The production numbers, while short of Tesla's own target, are far above the 793 Model 3s built in the final week of last year. 
""Progress is the first word that comes to mind after reading the Q1 delivery report,"" Nomura analyst Romit Shah said. 

""We believe that the backlog for Models S and X remains solid but that this is an area to monitor given the sequential declines.""

British-based employers are under heightened scrutiny over their pay structures and companies with more than 250 staff have to report their gender pay gap by April 4 to the Government Equalities Office.
Compared with other airlines that operate in the United Kingdom, Ryanair's mean pay gap outstripped low-cost rival easyJet (L:EZJ), where it stood at 51.7 percent, and British Airways (L:ICAG), where it was 35 percent.
The aviation industry has a particular issue with gender equality as the vast majority of pilots are men. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said only eight out of its 554 pilots based in the United Kingdom are women.
A majority of its 1,182 UK staff that are classified as being in either the lower middle or lower wage band are also women, Ryanair said on Tuesday.
Ryanair, whose largest base is at London's Stansted Airport, employs just under 10 percent of its staff in the United Kingdom. Its management and administration staff are largely based in its home market of Ireland.
""Like all airlines, our gender pay in the UK is materially affected by the relatively low numbers of female pilots in the aviation industry,"" Ryanair said in a presentation of the data published on its website.

""In recent years, the number of female pilots applying to Ryanair has increased and we are committed to developing this welcome trend. It is a feature of the aviation industry that more males than females choose to enter the pilot profession.""

The question becomes whether Tesla can take on new debt at an attractive price.Moody's says Tesla faces ""liquidity pressures"", while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says a ""fall in the share price can take on a self-fulfilling nature that further exacerbates the volatility of the share price"".

DUBAI (Reuters) - Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), the Dubai government’s main investment arm, has raised a $1.2 billion loan needed to refinance existing debt, banking sources said.
The loan was led by Citi (N:C), Dubai Islamic Bank (DU:DISB), Emirates NBD (DU:ENBD), HSBC (L:HSBA), ICBC (SS:601398) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN).
The Dubai sovereign wealth fund, whose portfolio includes stakes in companies such as Emirates Airline  and Emirates NBD, had assets totaling 786.8 billion dirham ($214.21 billion) as of June last year, according to its most recent financial results.
ICD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new loan.
The debt facility was syndicated to a larger group of banks and the fundraising has recently been completed, the sources said.
It partly refinances a $2.55 billion five-year loan ICD raised in 2013. That loan, which included an Islamic tranche, saw the participation of a group of banks including Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank,  Citigroup , Commercial Bank of Dubai, Emirates NBD, HSBC and Standard Chartered.

573,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Volatility's Comeback Unleashes Best Fund Returns of 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- In the world of passive investing, betting on equity swings is one of most lucrative trades on Wall Street once again -- but now it’s for long wagers.
Securities linked to volatility are the best performers among U.S. exchange-traded products this year. While in 2017 it was those wagering on calmer days that did the best, now it’s the ones that gain with the VIX index that are rallying the most.
With the S&P 500 Index posting its first quarterly slide since 2015, the Cboe Volatility Index has rebounded from record lows hit in 2017. Two leveraged securities tracking futures linked to the gauge of equity turmoil -- the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (ticker UVXY) and VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN (TVIX) -- have more than doubled this year, while the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has gained about 86 percent.
On the other hand, one of 2017’s best performers that’s tied inversely to volatility has become this year’s worst, after losing 91 percent.
At the same time, the popularity of volatility trading via VIX contracts has been waning, with the number of futures and options outstanding falling to levels not seen since 2016.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has urged investors to boost protection, saying that traders are more exposed to stock swings after the expiration of many S&P 500 hedges. The VIX fell 4.4 percent at 8:20 a.m. in New York after surging 18 percent on Monday.
For those looking into VIX contracts to bet on the future of stock swings, now may be a good time. While the volatility measure has doubled this year, a gauge tracking the cost of its options has climbed much less. The Cboe VVIX Index is now at its lowest level since 2016 relative to the VIX, indicating that contracts on the volatility benchmark are on the cheap side.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes ended higher after a choppy session on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season while the S&P 500 pushed above a key support level and Amazon.com shares jumped on bets that criticism from President Donald Trump would not translate to policy changes.
After a volatile session Amazon ended up being the biggest boost for Nasdaq. The White House said it wasn't taking action even as Trump continued his attacks on the online retailer, according to a Bloomberg report.
Traders said they were heavily focused on technical levels after investors fled on Monday when the S&P 500 breached its 200-day moving average. The benchmark index pushed above that support level just ahead of the last hour of trading on Tuesday and stayed higher for the rest of the session.
""There was opportunity for sellers to break through the 200-day but that didn't happen. Fundamentals are holding the stock market up. We're on the verge of the earnings reporting season. That's going to be a blockbuster,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to increase 18.4 percent for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 389.17 points, or 1.65 percent, to 24,033.36, the S&P 500 gained 32.57 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,614.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 71.16 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,941.28.
But some traders said technical sellers could still put pressure on stocks on Wednesday as the S&P's closing level was still too close for comfort to 2590.76 - the 200-day moving average - and 2532.69 - its Feb. 9 low. 
""I don't think we're in the clear,"" said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. ""Tomorrow morning will tell us. Every time we get a good rally the sellers come in. What we need is a two-day rally with a sustained buying pressure."" 
After spending the day swinging between positive and negative territory the S&P 500's technology sector, the biggest driver in the current bull market, ended up 1 percent. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares gained 6 percent after the electric automaker said it need not raise more capital this year and announced robust production numbers for its cheaper Model 3 sedans.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares ended up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05 though it was still well below its March 13 record of $1,617.54.
In its high-profile market debut, digital music provider Spotify Technology SA closed at $149.01, 12.9 percent higher than the $132 reference price set by the NYSE late on Monday, though well below its intraday high of $169 and its opening price of $165.90.
Viacom Inc fell 3.7 percent after Reuters reported that CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) planned to make an all-stock offer that valued the media company below its current market valuation. CBS shares rose 4.2 percent. CNBC reported late Tuesday that CBS had submitted a bid for Viacom well below its market value. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.86-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 111 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.14 billion shares, compared to the 7.31 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",JPMorgan's Kolanovic Warns of Liquidity Snarls But Stays Bullish,"(Bloomberg) -- A strong earnings season should bolster the rattled U.S. stock market, but potentially not without some further turmoil, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s head of quantitative and derivative strategy, Marko Kolanovic.
“Liquidity was a big problem in the market meltdown of early February, and hasn’t really recovered since then,” Kolanovic said in a March 29 interview in New York, referring to the worst selloff in the S&P 500 Index since August 2015. Buyers’ strikes could continue to plague the market as investors grapple with worries ranging from a global trade war to pressures on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., he said.
“A lot of these concerns are likely overblown -- it’s reflective of the psychology of fear driven by market volatility,” he said. “The only real problem now is low liquidity and market volatility,” he said. And liquidity should improve when the Cboe Volatility Index falls, he said.
The problem is that it isn’t, for now: the gauge surged 3.65 points on Monday, when the S&P 500 fell 2.2 percent. At issue is the willingness of selloff-scarred buyers to step into a market in times of doubt, according to Kolanovic, who’s earned his reputation by forecasting dramatic ups and downs in markets.
The structure of today’s market makes it more susceptible to sharper swings, he said:
Kolanovic isn’t the only one warning about liquidity.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategists led by Kokou Agbo-Bloua wrote in a note on March 30 that investors should be wary of the possibility for late-cycle volatility bursts fueled by distortions in liquidity.
But conditions aren’t yet in place to fuel a broader bear market, and bets on the big downturn may be premature, according to Kolanovic.
“Investors should just stick to facts and fundamentals,"" he said. ""Earnings should alleviate many of the fears.”

595,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 06:05PM ET</span>",Spotify shares jump in record-setting direct listing,"By Chuck Mikolajczak and Stephen Nellis
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Spotify Technology SA ended up 12.9 percent on their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange, a smooth debut that could pave the way for other companies looking to go public without the aid of Wall Street underwriters.
Spotify shares opened at $165.90, up nearly 26 percent from a reference price of $132 set by the NYSE late on Monday. The stock ended the session at $149.01, valuing the world's largest streaming music service at $26.5 billion.
The direct listing was seen as a test case for other companies tempted to list without selling new shares, and for bankers that could lose out on millions of dollars in underwriting fees for future initial public offerings. 
""It's a fair market price. It's not manipulated or set by any puts and takes by banks or institutional investors,"" said Chi-Hua Chien, an early investor in Spotify who is now at San Mateo, California-based venture capital firm Goodwater Capital.
Some market-watchers cautioned investors not to read too much into the first day of trading, given the mixed performance of recent tech IPOs and an increasingly competitive music streaming landscape.
HEMORRHAGING COSTS 
The direct listing by the Stockholm-founded company was the largest on record. Spotify now has a higher market value than Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which went public last year.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd remain the largest tech stock listings in recent years.
Since launching its service a decade ago, Spotify has overcome resistance from big record labels and some major music artists to transform how people listen to music. But it still does not make a profit and faces intense competition from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others. 
""Investors are right to have some reservations. Spotify is from the costs of licensing content,"" said Michael Carvin, chief executive of personal finance technology firm SmartAsset. ""Even though Spotify’s scale is about twice that of Apple Music, Apple has a huge ecosystem of products to market to.""
Spotify has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, including users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. On a comparable basis the Apple Music service has 46 million subscribers. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music Unlimited has an estimated 16 million paying subscribers and Pandora has 5.48 million total subscribers. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google does not release paid subscriber numbers for Google Play Music.
HEAVY TRADE 
After the listing, Spotify has an enterprise value - which takes into account cash and debt on the company's balance sheet - of about five times its 2017 revenue of $5 billion. 
That represents a premium to smaller rival Pandora Media Inc, which has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of one, but is far less than a comparable ratio above 10 for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Dropbox Inc.
Analysts had worried ahead of Spotify's direct listing that forgoing underwriters and traditional promotional events designed to stimulate interest from institutional investors could mean volatility once formal trading kicked off.
The NYSE set Spotify's reference price late on Monday to be in line with informal, private trading of Spotify shares, giving an early estimate of the level at which supply and demand could be balanced.
The opening public price was determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers and a designated market maker's determination of where buy orders could be matched with sell orders.
Nearly 30 million shares had changed hands by the end of regular trading hours. Some 91 percent of Spotify's 178 million shares were tradable, a much higher percentage than typical in a traditional IPO. 
While Chief Executive Daniel Ek skipped NYSE rituals such as opening bell-ringing and trading floor interviews to tout the stock, the front of the 115-year-old Greek Revival exchange building was draped in a vast green-and-black Spotify banner.

The only visible hiccup came when the NYSE also briefly flew a Swiss flag in honor of the Swedish company, which the NYSE later described on Twitter as a ""momentary ode to our neutral role in the process of price discovery.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The company that makes British passports will challenge the decision to use a foreign firm in future, a government decision that some eurosceptics in the tabloid press have called unpatriotic.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced post-Brexit Britain would change its passports from burgundy to blue - closer to how they looked before the color of EU passports was harmonized in 1988 - in ""an expression of our independence and sovereignty"".
But reports that Franco-Dutch firm  Gemalto  (AS:GTO), rather than Britain's  De La Rue  Plc (L:DLAR), had won the tender to produce them angered some Britons and the Daily Mail said more than 270,000 people had signed its petition demanding the contract go to a British company.
Gemalto, which already produces British driving licenses, has not confirmed or denied it won the contract, but De La Rue has publically criticized the decision to use a foreign firm. 
It said it would seek a judicial review of the tender decision as it believes it made ""the highest quality and technically most secure bid.""
The Daily Mail applauded De La Rue for ""coming out fighting"" and urged the government to ""put security and patriotism first"" by reversing its decision.
A spokesman for May said the standstill period - between a contract being awarded and its final conclusion - had been extended due to De La Rue's request, but the government had not changed its stance.
""This has been a rigorous, fair and open competition. The preferred bidder demonstrated they are best able to meet the needs of the passport service,"" he said. 
The passport issue has proved uncomfortable for May as she fends off accusation from hardliners in her own party that she will settle for a ""soft"" Brexit deal that could leave Britain still confined by many EU rules, which include open competition for public contracts.
Anti-Brexit figures have pointed out that Britain had never been obliged to make its passports burgundy and that one EU member, Croatia, already has blue passports. And, in an April Fools joke, the European Parliament tweeted on Sunday that the EU had decided to make all EU passports blue. 
De La Rue's contract, which ends in July 2019, is worth 400 million pounds ($562 million). The new contract will start in October 2019, after Britain leaves the EU in March.
Shares in De La Rue were little changed on Tuesday, having fallen 6 percent when it said it had lost the contract in March.

Britain's biggest trade union Unite said it supported De La Rue's legal challenge as it was concerned about manufacturing jobs.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>",Murdoch's Fox could sell Sky News to Disney to appease UK regulator,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky (L:SKYB) by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul's political influence.
Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) or become a legally separate business within the Sky group. 
Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators.
Fox had already promised that Sky's 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch's record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers. 
The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (0:CMCSA) to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox's 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid.
As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation.
Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain's media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch's influence. 
The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government. 
""We have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,"" it said.
""In fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA's provisional concerns.""
MATCHING COMCAST?
Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years.
Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead.
Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions addressed all concerns about the transaction. 
""We look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,"" he said.
Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast.
Analysts at Liberum said Fox's latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast.
First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders.
Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added.
A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News.
The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch's record of influence.
The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making ""a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions"".

The companies said on Tuesday that they were in talks to jointly negotiate purchases with their main, multi-national food and non-food suppliers.
Casino's planned partnership with Auchan in this area comes just a week after it struck a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Casino and Amazon said last week that groceries sourced from Casino's Monoprix supermarket arm would be available through the Amazon Prime Now app and website.
Amazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year, along with a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons, have led to speculation that Amazon could bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 11:45AM ET</span>",GM to drop monthly U.S. vehicle sale reports,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday it will stop reporting monthly U.S. vehicle sales, saying the 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect the market and the company will, instead, issue quarterly sales reports. 
GM will also no longer report monthly sales in China, its largest market, or Brazil. The company will provide monthly data to the U.S. Federal Reserve, industry associations and government agencies across the globe but that data will not be made public.
Other major automakers indicated on Tuesday that they would not immediately follow GM's lead on switching to reporting sales on a quarterly basis. 
""At this time, we are maintaining our reporting of sales on a monthly basis,"" said spokesman for  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
On a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford Motor Co's (N:F) U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the automaker would assess GM's move but a ""decision is not imminent"" as to whether the company will move to reporting quarterly sales.
On a conference call with reporters, Jack Hollis, Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) North American head of sales and marketing said there is ""no change planned on our side.""
Analysts and investors rely on monthly U.S. vehicle sales to track the performance of individual automakers, and also use the data as a barometer of the health of the world's second-largest auto market and an indicator of consumer confidence in the U.S. economy overall.
GM and its Detroit rivals  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) have relied heavily on sales of high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs to boost profits.GM's total U.S. sales, its second-largest market, are down 3.2 percent for the first two months of 2018, reflecting a 6.8 percent drop in retail sales to individual customers, the company reported last month.
Executives at GM have expressed frustration that comparisons of monthly U.S. sales results among rival automakers are distorted by short-term discount programs, and by differences in strategy for selling vehicles in bulk to rental car fleets. 
“Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,” Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president for sales operations said in a statement. 
GM's actions could prompt other automakers to also switch to quarterly U.S. sales reports. Major automakers report March U.S. new vehicle sales on Tuesday.
Until the early 1990s, most U.S. automakers released sales results every 10 days. The former Chrysler Corp, a forerunner of today's Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), stopped reporting sales on a 10-day basis in 1990, and rivals followed suit over the next three years.

GM executives are betting that investors will quickly adapt to receiving U.S. sales data every three months, as investors in other retail sectors already have. Retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) report sales on a quarterly basis.

It was unclear why Axis, a leading gold importer, was not on the list released on Monday.
A spokesman for the Reserve Bank of India did not have an immediate comment. An Axis Bank spokesman declined to comment.
The removal from the import list is a new blow for Axis, which has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in the last few months because of bad loans.
The move could help other leading bullion importer banks including  Yes Bank  (NS:YESB), HDFC Bank (NS:HDBK), Bank of Nova Scotia and  Kotak Mahindra Bank  (NS:KTKM) gain market share, said three bullion dealers at other Indian banks who asked to remain unidentified because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
The RBI will allow 16 banks to import bullion during the 2018/19 financial year, according to the list. Two other small private sector lenders -  Karur Vysya Bank  (NS:KARU) and South Indian Bank (NS:SIBK) - that were on the list last financial year did not make the latest one.
Karur Vysya has not imported gold for the past three financial years, said a senior bank official who asked not to be identified. A spokesman for South Indian Bank also said the bank has not imported gold since 2014.
The latest woes add to Axis Bank's ongoing problems including extra bad loans unearthed after an RBI audit for which it had to pay a fine. 
It is also among companies that were ordered by the markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conduct an internal probe into the suspected leak of financial information related to its results after a Reuters investigation. 

Shares in Axis Bank ended up 0.5 percent after falling 1 percent in early trade in a Mumbai market (NSEI) that rose 0.33 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian gas producer Santos Ltd (AX:STO) said on Tuesday it would ""engage with"" Harbour Energy after receiving a $10.4 billion takeover offer from the U.S. company, its fourth unsolicited bid since August 2017.
The bid, valuing Santos at a 28 percent premium to its last close, would give Harbour access to a recently revived company with a low cost of oil production and stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific, where demand is soaring.
News of the latest offer, the biggest inbound bid for a listed Australian company since Unibail-Rodamco's $16 billion buy-out offer for shopping mall giant Westfield Corp, sent Santos shares soaring. 
But even if accepted by Santos this time round, a deal may be fraught with political and regulatory risk: Australia's lingering energy supply crisis has stoked fears that companies that come under foreign ownership may ignore domestic needs.
""The price is definitely in the ball park of something that we will seriously consider,"" said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, Santo's ninth-largest shareholder.
Investment bank RBC Capital Markets described the bid as a ""knock-out"" in a note to clients on Tuesday.
The offer values Adelaide-based Santos (AX:STO) at A$6.50, per share, a 28 percent premium to the company's last closing share price of A$5.07. Santos' shares close 16.2 percent higher at A$5.89.
The latest offer price is also 43 percent higher than Harbour's first attempt last year. 
EXPANSION PLANS
Harbour's chief executive Linda Cook said the plan for Santos was ""one of growth, in Australia, Papua New Guinea and beyond"". 
""We are prepared to move expeditiously through the due diligence phase to immediately begin the government review and approval process,"" Cook said in a phone interview.
But given the highly politicized nature of the Australian domestic gas landscape and Santos' key role there, analysts and investors see government approval as a key risk to any deal.
A takeover would be subject to government approvals and will be scrutinized by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which provides recommendations to the government. Cook said Harbour was preparing its FIRB application. 
Santos' more sensitive assets include its interest in the Gladstone LNG project in the Australian state of Queensland and the strategically important Cooper Basin in the country's east, where significant onshore oil and gas deposits are located. 
""Any buyer of Santos would need to be prepared for ongoing engagement with government and public scrutiny for many years going forward,"" said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Still, for a new LNG player, Santos represents an attractive target given its portfolio of LNG assets and growth options, according to analysts.
'ENGAGE FURTHER'
""The Santos board considers that, based on the indicative offer price of A$6.50 per share, it is in the interests of shareholders to engage further with Harbour,"" Santos said in a statement to shareholders.
The bid from Washington-based Harbour, a private equity-backed firm led by Cook, who is a former Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc executive director, consists of $4.70 per share in cash and a special dividend of $0.28 per share, or A$6.50. 
The offer would allow for majority shareholders Hony Capital and ENN to retain a stake of up to 20 percent.
Santos was in considerable trouble just a few years ago, struggling with high debt and low oil (LCOc1) and gas  prices. But asset sales, debt reduction and cost-cutting have led it back to health.
As a result, Santos is seen to be able to produce profitably at average oil costs of just over $32 per barrel, versus actual costs of around $68 a barrel.
The company's focus on LNG, which is seen to be a bigger growth markets in coming years than oil, is also seen as attractive for investors.
Harbour plans to fund the takeover through a combination of debt and equity, with J.P. Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) underwriting $7.75 billion of debt.

Santos is a partner in the Papua New Guinea LNG export project, which was highly profitable before it got knocked out by a strong earthquake in late February. It is expected to resume operations in April.

Spotify is pursuing an unusual direct listing to reach the public markets in place of an initial public offering, and shares are expected to start trading on Tuesday.
The reference price is not an offering price for the shares, nor is it the opening public price for shares of the Swedish technology company.
The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers, the exchange said. Based on those orders, the opening price will be set based on a designated market maker's determination of where buy orders can be matched with sell orders at a single price.
But the reference price will play a part in Spotify's eventual pricing. 
Though Spotify has not hired traditional underwriters - a move that will save it millions of dollars in fees - it has hired Citadel Securities as a market maker to set the opening price on the NYSE, with help from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

While their roles will be limited, the reference price will be used while building the order book. Early on Tuesday, Citadel and Morgan Stanley will analyze investors' buy and sell orders and then set an opening price for the stock.

Technology shares fell following news that U.S. president Trump continued to attack Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over pricing of its delivery policies through the United States Postal Service. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) received some residual focus as Zuckerberg said it would take years to solve issues. ""I think we will dig through this hole, but it will take a few years,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with VOX. ""I wish I could solve all these issues in three months or six months, but I just think the reality is that solving some of these questions is just going to take a longer period of time.""
Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it is planning to move from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for Mac computer chips starting from 2020, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plunged 5.1% after the company was reportedly making 2,000 of its Model 3s per week, compared to the 2,500 target.
Overnight, the Nasdaq fell 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow traded 2.2% and 1.9% lower respectively.
Trade war tensions intensified after China announced it would impose retaliatory tariffs on 128 U.S. products including pork and fruit. A U.S. manufacturing activity report for March showed new orders slowed amid fear of a full-blown trade war between China and the U.S.

LONDON (Reuters) - World markets battled to regain their poise on Tuesday after another round of tech and trade war worries had clobbered shares and oil prices tumbled on signs of rising Russian supply and Saudi price cuts. 
Europe's main markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt were all down more than 0.5 percent, after being closed on Monday when the pace of selling had pushed U.S. markets below pivotal technical levels.
Tech stocks remained the pressure point, dropping more than 1 percent, after more criticism of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by U.S. President Donald Trump and as reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intended to make more of its own parts burnt European chipmakers like ams AG and STMicroelectronics.
Some signs of stability were emerging, though. Wall Street futures pointed higher, the dollar steadied against the yen after three days of decline and gold and government bonds were in reverse.
""There is actually very little contagion from all the equity market moves that are grabbing all the headlines,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy. 
Asia's shares had stumbled overnight, too, although less than Wall Street, where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union.
As well as the tech problems, investors were also wary after China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world's two biggest economies and stoking concerns about the impact on global growth.
Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.45 percent, after falling as much as 1.6 percent. China's Shanghai Composite index eased 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.7 percent.
U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling, with yields on 10-year notes off two- to three-month lows.
""The big question is how far the current tremor in the equity market will affect bonds, given it is driven by a single company - even if it is a tech giant having a huge market weight,"" said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. 
Among the main commodities, Brent oil futures nudged back up towards $68 a barrel. They had fallen more than 3.7 percent on Monday after news of rising Russian output and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute weighed on sentiment.
U.S. crude gained 14 cents to $63.15, copper jumped 1.4 percent for its fourth straight gain and spot gold ticked down 0.2 percent to $1,338.08 an ounce.

The White House wants leaders from Mexico and Canada to join in unveiling broad outlines of an updated pact at the Summit of the Americas which begins on April 13, the report said. Technical talks to sort out the finer details and legal text could continue, according to the Bloomberg report.
Reuters could not immediately independently verify Bloomberg's reporting. 
Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's Economy minister will travel to Washington on Wednesday for meetings with U.S. Trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Mexican sources told Reuters.
The Bloomberg report said any meetings could include Jared Kushner and Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who have been managing Trump's relationship with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
On Thursday, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland will arrive for her own meetings with Lighthizer and meetings on Friday may include all three countries, Bloomberg said, citing its sources.
A White House spokeswoman, Natalie Strom, said of the talks in general on Monday that Lighthizer remarked in March that time is running short to complete a new NAFTA deal.
""Negotiations are continuing on a daily basis with the goal of a successful and rapid conclusion, and the NAFTA countries will announce plans as warranted,"" Strom said.
Last week, Lighthizer expressed optimism that negotiations to modify NAFTA were making progress and that a deal in principle could be reached quickly.
The thorniest issues in the NAFTA talks with Mexico and Canada concern U.S. demands on automotive trade and dispute settlement systems. Linking the future of the 24-year-old trade deal to Trump's border wall plan has never been among U.S. negotiating objectives.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, asked in a CNBC interview on Monday about the report and whether it was realistic to wrap up NAFTA in two weeks, said: ""Well, the issue here, which the president understands keenly is that the Mexican elections are approaching and you're going to get to a certain point, just like you do in the American elections, where it becomes difficult to do meaningful policy changes. So I think whether it's two weeks or thirty days, it's got to be soon.""

616,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico governor slams congressman over 'dictatorial' letter,"By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's governor on Monday fiercely defended his administration's right to help steer the insolvent, storm-ravaged island out of bankruptcy after a U.S. congressman said the process should be led by the island's creditors and federally appointed oversight board.
In a scorching, 6,000-word letter delivered on Monday to U.S. Representative Rob Bishop, and seen by Reuters, Governor Ricardo Rossello accused the Republican lawmaker of turning ""back the clock many decades to a time when the federal government simply imposed its will"" on the U.S. territory.
Bishop, who chairs the House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, was at the forefront of a 2016 federal law known as PROMESA, which moved Puerto Rico's finances under the management of a federally appointed board.
In a letter last week, Bishop censured the board for lack of progress on a massive planned debt restructuring in Puerto Rico, directing the board to seek more input from the island's financial creditors on a plan to stabilize the island.
Rossello said on Monday that flew in the face of PROMESA, which calls for the board and the governor to work together. He said the sides had made consensual progress on elements of Puerto Rico's restructuring. 
""I cannot and will not permit you to elevate concerns of bondholders on the mainland above concern for the well-being of my constituents,"" Rossello said in the 13-page rebuke. ""Your letter is truly disturbing in its reckless disregard for collaboration and cooperation in favor of an anti-democratic process akin to a dictatorial regime.""
Puerto Rico is navigating both the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years with September's Hurricane Maria. The storm killed dozens, devastated the island's infrastructure, and has left thousands without power more than six months later.
Rossello's letter, scattered with legal arguments supporting a theory that the board's powers are limited, foreshadows the potential for litigation if his government and the oversight board cannot come to terms on a path forward for the island. 
The two sides have been collaborating on an economic forecast, called a fiscal turnaround plan, whose projections will determine, crucially, how much money the island has left over to repay its bondholders. 
But they are apart on key issues, namely demands by the board to impose pension cuts and labor reforms. The governor has said those demands constitute specific policy decisions that exceed the board's power.
The board has the authority to certify a plan unilaterally if it cannot reach terms with the governor, and Bishop's letter was seen as a nod to that increasingly likely scenario. In it, Bishop essentially instructed the board to use its powers to enforce austerity measures and start collaborating with creditors rather than with just the government.
A unilateral plan would likely perpetuate already costly litigation over Puerto Rico's financial future, because Rossello could resist implementing the board's plan, and the board could then sue to enforce it, a scenario that has some precedent. 

Rossello insisted his government was owed a seat at the table. ""Congress did not create a control board ... with plenary policymaking power,"" the governor said. ""Congress expressly rejected such a model.""

618,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>","As Wall Street sinks, Trump is his own worst enemy","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As far as the stock market is concerned, U.S. President Donald Trump is, right now, his own worst enemy. 
The president - who frequently touted Wall Street's rally following his 2016 election victory - was partly blamed for a sharp stock selloff on Monday that investors believe is likely to continue, deepening cracks in a nine-year-old bull run. 
The selling was sparked by escalating fears of a trade war as China slapped tariffs on a host of U.S. goods as Trump prepares to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese imports, and by Trump's renewed criticism of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""The president's behavior is now beginning to impact the capital markets - both the averages and individual equities,"" said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida.
Particularly worrisome to investors on Monday: more weakness in the tech sector, which led the market up in recent months, and a breach below a major S&P 500 technical level. 
In a Twitter post, Trump attacked Amazon for a second time in three days over the pricing of its deliveries through the United States Postal Service and promised unspecified changes.
Amazon's stock slumped 5.2 percent and led the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down, pressuring other high-growth, technology-related stocks, including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB). Outcry in recent weeks over Facebook's handling of data about its users has shaken the tech sector with fears of greater governmental oversight. 
""(One) big factor is Trump further going after the tech sector, namely Amazon,"" said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York. ""It casts a shadow effectively around all of the tech sector."" 
TECH SECTOR PAIN = MARKET PAIN 
The selloff in technology-related stocks was seen as a particularly worrisome sign for investors who have banked on that sector continuing to drive the broader market. 
""It's very significant,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York. ""Selling tech is not a sector rotation story, its a sell-the-market story."" 
Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade"" - with most investors having the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes.
""What we've learned over the past two weeks is just how overweight investors were in technology,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of Datatrek Research, New York. 
Investors saw more selling pressure ahead, particularly after the S&P 500 (SPX) dipped below a major technical level, the 200-day moving average, for the first time since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. The index closed at 2,582, for a year-to-date decline of 3.4 percent. 
""We have been pounding on the 200-day for the last six sessions and now we've broken through,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas. There may be support around the 2,537 level, he said, ""but then below that we may be looking at 2,500 or so again, which is pretty scary."" 
In Trump's first year as president, the S&P 500 surged 24 percent on bets he would boost the economy with fiscal spending, deregulation and deep tax cuts. Trump tweeted frequently about the stock market as it rallied through 2017. But since a selloff in February, he has been noticeably silent.
But this bull market has frequently staged swift recoveries, and some were poised for opportunity.

""I'm taking advantage of these markets and am heavily overweighted financials and banks,"" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer Of Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. ""I didn't buy today, we're in freefall, but I might tomorrow.""

623,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: CBS plans all-stock bid for Viacom below current valuation - sources,"By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) plans to make an all-stock offer for Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) that values the U.S. media company below its current market valuation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, indicating that tough negotiations lie ahead. 
It is unusual for deal negotiations to start with the acquirer valuing its target at a discount. The fact that CBS's first bid for Viacom infers such a valuation reflects how CBS views its position in the U.S. media landscape as superior to Viacom's.
As part of its initial offer to be submitted in the next few days, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves will propose to stay at the helm for at least two years if the U.S. media company's bid to merge with peer Viacom is accepted, according to the sources.
That offer is contingent on Viacom accepting all other aspects of CBS's bid, the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
CBS and Viacom declined to comment.
Viacom's shares were down 3 percent at around $29.62 in after-hours trading, while CBS shares were little changed. CBS and Viacom have market capitalizations of $19.4 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively. 
CBS and Viacom set up special committees to explore the merger in February, a move to reunite the companies split by controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago.
The two companies explored a merger in 2016 instigated by the Redstone family, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues. 
Since then, Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has taken a number of steps to boost the company's performance, including improving relations with cable and satellite companies, causing some analysts to expect CBS to acquire Viacom at a premium.
Many of Viacom and CBS's competitors are merging as scale becomes increasingly important in the media landscape, with more customers cancelling pricey cable contracts, and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) spending billions of dollars on making shows and movies.

Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) announced in December it would buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (A:FOX) assets. Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) recently bought Scripps Networks Interactive Inc (O:SNI).

1. Fed Speak, Total Vehicle Sales In Focus Amid Ongoing Trade War Fears 
There’s little on the economic calendar Tuesday for top-tier economic data, as Fed officials Kashkari and Brainard are slated to deliver speeches, while total vehicle sales will likely be monitored for clues on the underlying strength of the US auto industry.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari is scheduled to speak at 09:30 ET, while Fed Governor Lael Brainard is due to deliver a speech at 16:30 ET.
Fed governor Lael Brainard’s speech is likely to attract added attention after the governor adopted a more hawkish in March. Brainard said should the economy continue to progress it will “likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.""
Total vehicle sales for March, meanwhile, are expected to show an decline to 16.9 million from 17.08 million the previous month.
Escalating U.S.-China trade war tensions, however, could continue to drive investor sentiment after US stocks fell sharply Monday before paring of some of their losses, with the Dow closing more than 400 points lower.
2. Crude Supplies to Rise for Second-Straight Week?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday after data last week showed crude inventories rose sharply.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 5.321 million barrels for the week ended March 29. That was well above the 1.643 million barrel increase reported by the Energy Information Administration during the same period.
Crude oil futures started the month on the back foot, settling 3% lower at $63.01 a barrel as risk-off sentiment, forced traders to flee riskier assets.
3. Tesla to Pare Losses as Q1 Production Update Draws Closer?
Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5% on Monday ahead of its quarterly production numbers for its Model 3 sedan slated for sometime this week.
The fall in Tesla comes despite an internal email obtained by Jalopnik on Monday, suggesting the company has achieved its 2,000 per week Model 3 production target.
""If things go as planned today, we will comfortably exceed that [2,000 target] over a seven day period...this is already double the pace of 2017,"" and could reach ""four times faster than last year"" Musk wrote in the email, obtained by Jalopnik.
The email suggests that the carmaker will beat Wall Street expectations for units of Model 3 production of between 1,500 to 1,700 per week."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amber Baldet, a blockchain program lead at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), is leaving the bank to launch her own venture, JPMorgan said on Monday.
Baldet, one of the best-known executives focused on blockchain at a major lender, led JPMorgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence and helped the bank set its strategy for the nascent technology. 
Baldet will be replaced by Christine Moy, a senior product manager in the bank's Blockchain Center of Excellence, according to an internal bank memo sent on Monday and seen by Reuters.
The memo was sent by Umar Farooq, head of channels, analytics and innovation for treasury services and head of blockchain initiatives for JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.
""Amber is extremely talented and helped build the outstanding team we have today,"" JPMorgan spokeswoman Jessica Francisco told Reuters in a written statement. ""We respect her desire to start her own venture and we wish her nothing but the best.""
Blockchain originally emerged as the technology powering cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but banks and other large corporations have been seeking to adapt it to run some of their processes.
They believe that the distributed database technology can help them simplify and reduce the costs of their businesses like securities settlement and payments processing.
JPMorgan has been active in the space through initiatives like Quorum, a type of blockchain it developed for enterprises to build business applications. Reuters reported last month that the bank was considering spinning off Quorum.
In her role at JPMorgan, Baldet led product development for Quorum and was tasked with helping set the corporate and investment bank's blockchain strategy.

Moy had been leading blockchain product development for the bank's investor services and capital markets business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department, seeking to stop AT&T Inc's (N:T) deal to purchase  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), sought to show how often Time Warner subsidiary Turner would threaten to cut off cable companies to win concessions during contract negotiations.
The Justice Department has asked Judge Richard Leon, who is hearing the testimony, to order the companies to abandon the deal on the grounds that it is illegal under antitrust law.
Coleman Breland, who negotiated distribution contracts for Turner for more than two decades, testified about a series of instances in which the movie and TV show maker threatened to ""go dark,"" essentially cutting off access to content for various cable providers.
Breland acknowledged that Turner's leverage in contract talks was the ability to cut off access to content, adding ""usually blackouts are temporary."" Breland is still with Turner but is now president of content experiences, TCM and FilmStruck.
The U.S. government has argued that AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner and would have less incentive to avoid ""going dark"" because its DirecTV subsidiary could win over rivals' irritated subscribers.
By threatening to go dark, Time Warner was able to get higher rates, convince pay TV companies to take more channels and make sure those channels were offered on a ""basic"" tier rather than an optional one, Breland acknowledged under questioning.
Cable One lost subscribers after a Turner blackout in 2016 that lasted 25 days, Breland acknowledged although neither he nor the Justice Department's lawyer Dylan Carson said how many.
Breland argued that the aggressive negotiating between 2013 and 2017 was a period where the company was trying raise rates that they felt were too low. ""We viewed that as a catch-up period for us to get back where we should be,"" he said.
Breland also noted that Time Warner and other content makers faced still competition online from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. ""They are very impressive competitors that want to pull eyeballs away,"" he said.

The trial, which is taking place in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to take six to eight weeks.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 09:59AM ET</span>","Silicon Valley, Wall Street taking notes on Spotify debut","By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Spotify Technology  SA's (N:SPOT) unusual route to becoming a public company is a test case for other multibillion-dollar tech companies that are looking to sell their shares but are not in need of cash.
On Tuesday, investors will be able to buy and sell shares in the Swedish music streaming service in the New York Stock Exchange's first-ever direct floor listing. 
This is without Spotify having hired investment banks as underwriters and undertaking an investor road show as is typical in a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
If it goes well, other highly valued tech firms expected to pursue a listing in the future, with the likes of U.S. ride hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Lyft Inc, could look to adopt a similar approach.
Wall Street banks will also be seeking feedback from investors on the day, and are looking to come up with ways to make up at least part of the millions of dollars in potential lost underwriting fee revenue.
""Everybody is going to watch what will happen with Spotify,"" said Columbia Law School professor John Coffee, who focuses on securities regulation.
Given the listing's first-of-its-kind nature, observers will be watching to make sure Spotify's public market valuation does not plunge below previous private valuation and trading holds relatively steady.
Spotify can eschew a traditional IPO because it does not require fresh capital and is a popular consumer brand about which the investors do not need educating through a road show.
""This is a big moment for the venture capital industry,"" said Felix Capital managing partner Frederic Court, a European venture capitalist. ""It will enable billions to be returned back to investors, which will release more capital into Europe.""
Spotify's direct listing also follows a mixed bag of recent IPOs by some of the so-called tech unicorns that had been worth at least $1 billion. 
Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and meal-kit subscription company  Blue Apron Holdings Inc  (N:APRN) have failed to live up to their IPO valuations once they started trading in public markets. 
In Blue Apron's case, its market capitalization has fallen from a peak of more than $2.5 billion to less than $400 million. 
But Dropbox Inc's (O:DBX) March IPO saw shares in the cloud-based file storage company surge more than 35 percent on their first day of trading, evidence the traditional IPO route can still be a success for startups.
""Both Dropbox and Spotify are very prominent unicorns. Those are two paths,"" Coffee said.
Lyft said in December its latest round of funding brought its valuation to $11.5 billion. Uber's latest valuation has been pegged at more than $70 billion.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to requests for comment on the Spotify listing.
MARKET COMFORT
Loss-making Spotify, which has prioritized rapid growth over profit and whose closest rival is Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Apple Music, launched in 2008 and had 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017. 
Run by co-founder Daniel Ek, Spotify was valued at around $20 billion based on private stock transactions in February, according to its filing for the listing.
Citadel Securities will act as the designated market maker for Spotify's shares, a source familiar with the listing said, and set the opening price on Tuesday.
Spotify has hired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Allen & Company LLC as financial advisers but they will not have an underwriting role.
""This approach will save the company money, but will probably lead to volatility when the stock starts trading, as the market tries to find a price it's comfortable with,"" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), wrote in a note.
One equity capital markets banker at a major firm, which was not on the direct listing, said their syndicate desk had been instructed to ask investors for feedback following the Spotify listing. 
Syndicate desks market, price and distribute stock offerings.

The purpose will be to give the bank color to take into pitch meetings with prospective clients if the direct listing is considered a success.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 10:03PM ET</span>",EPA to relax fuel efficiency standards for autos,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday rejected an Obama-era plan to make automobiles more fuel efficient, opening up a long process to weaken current standards and putting California and the federal government on a collision course over vehicle emissions.
Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement that the standards on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles were not appropriate and should be revised. 
The Obama administration set the average fleet-wide fuel efficiency standards ""too high"" and ""made assumptions about the standards that didn't comport with reality,"" Pruitt said. He did not offer specifics on revising them. 
The standards called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon. Proponents said they could help spur innovation in clean technologies.
California has long been allowed by an EPA waiver to impose stricter standards than Washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants. And 12 other states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, follow California's lead on cleaner cars. 
That has set up a battle on vehicle efficiency between California, the most populous U.S. state and a massive car market, and the administration of President Donald Trump. 
Pruitt is a big proponent of states' rights to regulate themselves, but opposes California's push for greener cars. California's waiver to impose its own efficiency standards is being re-examined, the EPA said. 
It is in ""America's best interest to have a national standard,"" Pruitt said in the release.
California Governor Jerry Brown blasted the EPA's action. ""This cynical and meretricious abuse of power will poison our air and jeopardize the health of all Americans,"" Brown said. 
Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, said her state ""will vigorously defend the existing clean vehicle standards."" 
PATCHWORK OF RULES
Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011 as part of a bailout deal. But they have urged Pruitt and Trump to revise the Obama standards so it becomes easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks.
Automakers also want to avoid a patchwork of rules that would add costs to engine manufacturing.
""The best way to achieve our collective goals is under a single national program that provides an aggressive but achievable pathway, a variety of compliance tools, and factors in the role of customers,"" said John Bozzella, president and chief executive officer of the Association of Global Automakers.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Pruitt made the right decision and that the administration was working on a way to both increase fuel economy and ""keep new vehicles affordable to more Americans.""
Changes to the standards could affect car manufacturers, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc
Auto suppliers were cautiously optimistic about the creation of a national fuel efficiency plan. Steve Handschuh, head of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, said while his group supports adjustments and flexibilities ""we do not support significant changes to the standards."" 
Environmentalists decried Pruitt's decision, saying stricter standards would slash emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Proponents of the corporate average fuel economy standards, or CAFE, say they have led to big gains in auto technology and that relaxing them could eventually hurt sales of U.S. cars in European and Asian countries that are moving toward mandates for electric cars. 

It would ""take America backward by jeopardizing successful safeguards that are working to clean our air, save drivers money at the pump, and drive technological innovation that creates jobs,"" said Luke Tonachel, a clean vehicles advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Inflation Could Help Ease the U.S.'s Debt Burden: Aaron Brown,"(Bloomberg View) -- Few topics are less conducive to rational debate than the national debt. One of the most divisive questions is whether a country can get into trouble issuing debt in a currency it controls. Surely, a nation would face bigger problems if it borrows in foreign currencies or gold than if it only promises to repay in script it can print itself. But how much of an advantage is it to control the borrowing currency?
The issue is gaining in importance as the U.S. is poised to more than double to $1 trillion the amount of debt it issues this year to pay for a ballooning budget deficit.
In the extreme, some people imagine that the U.S. could simply print lots of $1,000 bills to pay Treasury debt as it comes due. That's not realistic. Investors would treat such an action as a default, and that's what it would be. There would be the same financial and diplomatic repercussions and the same downstream bankruptcies as if the government simply refused to pay. Moreover, the economy would lose its currency. Private debts and nominal contract revenues denominated in dollars would become worthless. The U.S. would be much wiser to negotiate a restructuring.
A more reasonable scenario would be if the U.S. allowed mild inflation to reduce the purchasing power of the dollars needed to repay the debt. The difficulty here is that while inflation reduces the value of the existing debt, it causes investors to demand higher interest on future debt. If the U.S. had the fiscal discipline to pay off debt out of income as it came due, this would not be a problem. But if America had that kind of fiscal discipline, it wouldn't have any debt problems in the first place.
Look at the experience from high inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s. Since 1970, the U.S. has issued $134 trillion of Treasuries to the public and repaid $119 trillion, leaving $15 trillion outstanding. Converting to 2017 dollars, the U.S. issued $184 trillion, repaid $163 trillion and so has net borrowings of $21 trillion 2017 dollars. Since it only owes $15 trillion of 2017 dollars, it saved $6 trillion due to inflation.
On the interest side, the U.S. paid $7 trillion in interest, which translates to $12 trillion in 2017 dollars. Inflation accounted for $7 trillion and $5 trillion was real return to investors. So while inflation since 1970 saved the U.S. $6 trillion on debt repayments, it cost it $7 trillion in additional interest.
The chart below shows the yearly effect of inflation. The yellow line is the annual inflation rate on the right scale. The blue line is the gain each year from inflation eroding the value of the existing stock of public Treasury debt, in billions of dollars on the left scale. The red line, also in billions of dollars on the left scale, shows my estimate of how much extra interest the U.S. paid because of that year's inflation. You can see that the red line is consistently above the blue line. Inflation has added to the real cost of the debt, not reduced it.
Of course, the U.S. has not been running inflation as a calculated effort to minimize the cost of the debt, so the fact that inflation has hurt in the past doesn't mean it might not help in the future. It comes down to whether the Treasury can fool investors. My personal guess is that the Treasury might be able to take in individual investors and less sophisticated institutions, but there's no virtue is transferring national debt problems to them.
I doubt that the Treasury can make a lot of money consistently fooling smart money investors, including foreign central banks. So I don't think inflation is a magic bullet for debt problems. It may buy time for negotiating restructuring, but I think the U.S. will either have to pay back back the purchasing power of what it borrowed, default or keep rolling the debt over forever.

The initiative, code-named Kalamata, is still in early developmental stages but is part of a bigger strategy to make Apple's family of devices work more similarly and seamlessly together, according to the report.
Apple, which has used Intel chips in its computers since 2005, and the computer chipmaker both declined to comment. Intel shares closed down 6.1 percent at $48.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) ended down 2.7 percent.
Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note he believed the market was ""over reacting"" to the report on Apple's plans and that Intel's prospects remained good. ""We do not expect any other PC manufacturers will consider designing its own CPUs,"" he wrote in the note.
Other analysts said Apple would likely phase Intel's chips out over time.
“While it’s possible that Apple may replace Intel in some of its lower-end product lines, we think it will be difficult for Apple to completely replace Intel by 2020, especially on its higher-end offerings,"" said Summit Insights group analyst Kinngai Chan.
The Mac plays a small part in Apple's overall financial picture, with sales of 19.2 million units last year and accounting for 11 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017.
But while the laptop and desktop computer market has been in a years-long slump amid the rise of smartphones and tablet computers, Mac sales rose 4 percent in 2017. The growth came even as PC sales declined slightly to 259.5 million units, the smallest drop since 2011, according to data from research firm IDC.
While Apple's reported move away from Intel would be a major shift for its Mac lineup, it follows years of increasing focus on designing its own chips for its devices. The company has been designing its own iPhone processors since the release of the iPhone 4 in 2010 and has steadily increased the amount of chip work it handles itself. 

""We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality,"" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said of Apple's chip efforts last year.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Transcontinental beefs up packaging business with $1.32 billion Coveris deal,"By Ahmed Farhatha
(Reuters) -  Transcontinental Inc  (TO:TCLa) said it would buy the U.S. packaging business of Coveris Holdings S.A. for $1.32 billion (C$1.70 billion) as the Canadian publisher looks to join other top North American companies in the flexible packaging space.
The deal almost matched Transcontinental's $1.52 billion market value as of Thursday's close and sent its shares up as much as 16 percent to a near 5-month high of C$29.49 on Monday. 
The plastics and packaging industry has been consolidating rapidly to cash in on the rising demand from ecommerce businesses, food and meat producers and automotive sector.
Transcontinental has been bulking up its packaging assets while selling off newspapers amid a slowdown in the newsprint industry.
In March, the company bought Chicago-based confectionary packager Multifilm Packaging Corp and in October it took over Les Industries Flexipak Inc in Quebec to expand its reach in eastern Canada. 
""We believe this transaction is entirely consistent with the company's transformation from printing to packaging as well as the desire to consummate a larger acquisition,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds wrote in a client note.
As part of latest deal, Transcontinental will take control of privately held Coveris Americas's 21 production facilities that make rollstock, bags and pouches, shrink films and labels, among others. 
The U.S. unit of Coveris racked up $966 million in revenue in 2017, while Transcontinental's packaging business generated 15 percent of its total revenue of C$2.01 billion in fiscal 2017. 
Coveris, which would be left with 44 facilities in 14 countries after the sale, is planning to use the proceeds from the sale to pay off debt. 
Transcontinental would use both cash in hand and debt to finance the deal, which it believes, could save costs of about $20 million over the next two years. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.
BMO Capital Markets and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC were the financial advisers to Transcontinental and Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities for Coveris Americas.
The shares of the Montreal-based company were trading up 9.4 percent at C$27.83 in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs Sees Equity Volatility Spillover, Urges Hedging","(Bloomberg) -- Equity volatility is elevated but options trading shows investors’ appetite for protection hasn’t picked up, indicating hedging is needed, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Strategists led by John Marshall observed that “a large number” of S&P 500 hedges expired over the past three weeks, leaving the average investor more exposed to stock swings. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index almost doubled in the first quarter as concerns over global trade tensions and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stirred up market turbulence. The options gauge, known as VIX, jumped 20 percent to 23.89 as of 12:11 p.m. in New York.
While the heightened volatility has been largely contained in the stock market, that increase may suppress the risk appetite in other assets over the coming months, potentially spurring widespread turbulence, according to Goldman Sachs.
“A shift towards risk reduction and expectation of higher volatility is likely to change the trading dynamics in 2018 and increase the value of time spent on hedging,” the strategists wrote in a note to clients. “The spike in VIX and realized volatility was large enough for investors outside the equity market to take notice.”
The firm identified seven major concerns, including a credit meltdown and growth deceleration, as the biggest threat to financial markets. After studying the relationship between each risk factor and all asset classes, the strategists recommended the cheapest options for each dangerous scenario.
Investors fretting over credit stress should buy options on Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, they said. For those worried about rising interest rates or inflation, derivative contracts on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF are attractive.
The strategists don’t recommend buying S&P 500 options to hedge against losses in the U.S. equity benchmark, because they see contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund as cheaper.

658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Quarter Begins as Investors Ask One Thing: Is Nowhere Safe?,"(Bloomberg) -- The question facing investors as they enter the new quarter probably isn’t where to find the biggest gains. It’s more likely how to avoid the worst losses.
Both the American benchmark stock gauge and the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. aggregate bond index just posted a three-month loss for the first time since mid 2016. Emerging-market dollar debt slid, as did an index of commodities. Of major global assets, developing-nation stocks stood out as gaining -- but even they fell in both February and March.
The gloomy outlook is a sea change from recent years, when stocks, bonds and other assets rallied in unison against the backdrop of easy money and synchronized global growth. But markets have been roiled in recent weeks by concerns over tighter monetary policy, talk of a potential trade war and a sell-off in technology stocks.
“There isn’t always somewhere to hide,” David Schawel, chief investment officer at advisory firm Family Management Corp., wrote in a blog post. “To some degree, investors have become accustomed to a heuristic of ‘if stocks sell off, then bonds go up.’ While the flight-to-quality narrative does play out from time to time, it’s clearly not always true.”
As U.S. stock declines deepen on Monday, here’s a look at how seemingly all the biggest assets disappointed in the first quarter:
Sorry Stocks
No matter where you put your money as a developed-market stock investor in the first three months of 2018, chances are you probably took a loss. In dollar terms, U.S. and German equities were particularly hard hit. A small gain in Japanese shares helped the main Asian gauge, but not enough to stop it from also finishing in the red.
Credit Clouds
Investors pulled about $9.7 billion out of exchange-traded funds that track global corporate bonds in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the biggest U.S. investment-grade ETF, that meant the worst quarter of outflows on record.
Those outflows showed up in returns data, with a Bloomberg Barclay’s Index of U.S. corporate bonds posting a 2.3 percent loss for the first three months of the year.
Base Metals Weigh
The risk-off mood was good for gold, which climbed 1.7 percent in the three months through March. West Texas oil also also advanced, rising for the third quarter in a row on a combination of output cuts and robust demand.
But even with those gains, commodities couldn’t put in a positive performance in the period. Bloomberg’s index of raw materials finished the quarter 0.8 percent lower, weighed down by base metals in particular.
The commodity declines underscore the lack of places for investors to hide, according to Schawel.
“Going back the last 30 years, during the time periods where stocks and bonds both fell, commodities were positive five out of eight times, while gold was positive half of the time,” he wrote.
Silver Linings
Alongside gold, the Japanese yen -- another traditional safe-haven asset -- handed investors decent returns in the turbulent first three months of the year. Perhaps more surprisingly, some of the riskiest assets did as well.
Emerging-market local currency bonds returned almost 3 percent, while equities from developing nations also clung onto gains.
Investors, strategists and traders remain bullish on emerging assets for the rest of 2018 amid healthy economic conditions, a Bloomberg survey shows. Still, with U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist moves heating up, even this corner of global markets could face headwinds.
“From a tactical perspective, times like these typically cause the average investor to question their holdings and ask what should be done,” Schawel said. “Very few investors, even professional investors, have long-term success in timing the market over the short term.”

663,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",India pushes state banks to find own funding sources after $32 billion bailout,"By Neha Dasgupta and Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A massive $32 billion bailout package for India's dominant state-run banks will not happen again and lenders will have to find their own funding by selling non-core assets and merging with each other, a senior government official said on Monday. 
Twenty-one banks, majority owned by New Delhi, account for more than two-thirds of the banking assets in Asia's third-biggest economy. These lenders also account for close to 90 percent of soured loans in the banking sector.
Last October, the finance ministry announced a state-bank rescue plan worth 2.11 trillion rupees ($32.41 billion) - $14 billion of which it is in the process of injecting as a first tranche - to help banks set aside enough for their bad loans and boost credit growth in an economy where banks are the main source of funding.
""My message is no more recapitalization. Whatever has happened, has happened. Clean up on your own,"" the official who oversees the state banking sector told Reuters.
""We brought you out of the intensive care unit (ICU). Now, if you again go back to the ICU, and we keep bringing you out, that's not how it's done,"" said the official, declining to be named.
The Indian government would like to get the total number of state-run banks to down to 12-13 from 21 now through mergers, the official said. He did not give a time-frame for such deals, but expected some bank mergers to happen during the current financial year that began on Sunday.
""You either shrink or find some synergy,"" the official said. 
Recent rule changes by the Reserve Bank of India that did away with existing loan-restructuring schemes and aims to steer more defaulting companies into the bankruptcy courts could mean non-performing loans in state-run banks could rise from nearly 8 trillion rupees now, the official said, although he added 10 trillion rupees would be the upper limit for any such increase.
Including restructured or rolled over loans, all banks in India had a total 9.5 trillion rupees of soured loans as of end-December, central bank data shows. State-run banks' stressed loan pile was 8.26 trillion rupees, or 15.8 percent of their total loans.
To avert situations like the massive $2 billion fraud in state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) that stunned the financial sector, the government is asking banks to constantly monitor loans above 2.5 billion rupees and report at their board meetings every quarter, the official said. 
The government is also working to ease the country's fledgling bankruptcy laws to help speed up the resolution process, the official said. 
One of the proposals is to allow a resolution process to go ahead if 66 percent of the creditors vote for it, compared with the current requirement of a minimum of 75 percent.
""We are facing some resistance here from the promoters,"" the official said, referring to the main backers of companies. 
""But we are planning to ease the process with more changes.""

""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,"" Trump tweeted. 
""They lose a fortune, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!"" 
Shares of the company were down 5.9 percent at $1,362.48, wiping out nearly $45 billion from its market value.
Trump has been vocal about his opposition to Amazon's use of the postal service and Monday's tweet adds to investor worries that the company could see more regulation.
Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.
On Saturday, Trump tweeted that if the post office ""increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 billion.""
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in November reported a decline in annual revenue, hurt by a drop in first-class and marketing mail, offset partly by an increase in package delivery.
The postal service has also been posting losses mainly because of payments, more than $5 billion a year as mandated by Congress to prefund the service's future retirees' healthcare.
The passage of postal reform legislation could alleviate USPS’s pension obligations, give it more pricing power and allow the agency to be more competitive, analysts said.
""We believe the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has gained share from Amazon which is helping the USPS stay afloat,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote.
Details of Amazon's payments to the USPS are not publicly known, but some Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays the postal service roughly half what it would to  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) or FedEx Corp (N:FDX) to deliver a package.
""President Trump's comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon's deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note. 
""An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow,"" Forte said.

Trump last Thursday accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, making the postal system lose money and putting small retailers out of business.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>","India's stressed bank loans tick up to $146 billion in December, RBI data shows","By Devidutta Tripathy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Soured loans at India's banks rose in the three months to December to 9.5 trillion rupees ($145.9 billion), after declining from record high levels in the previous quarter, data from the central bank showed on Monday.
Stressed loans - which include non-performing as well as restructured or rolled-over loans - rose 0.4 percent from 9.46 trillion rupees as at end-September, unpublished data reviewed by Reuters showed. 
The ratio of the troubled loans, however, eased to 11.9 percent at December end from 12.2 percent three months earlier, according to the data compiled by Reserve Bank of India, based on filings by individual lenders.
Banks are staring at an increase in their soured loans pile - which hit a record high of 9.51 trillion rupees at the middle of last year - after a central bank rule change announced in February abolished all existing restructuring schemes. 
While resolutions under the fledgling Indian bankruptcy court process should help lower some of the soured loans pile, bankers and analysts say the worst of the bad woes for the banks may be yet to come.
Banks' stressed-loan pile has more than doubled in the five years to last December as a prolonged economic slowdown pressured companies' ability to service their loans, while in some cases profligate lending practices and fraudulent transactions have also aggravated the problem.
A more than $2 billion fraud in the second-biggest Indian state-run lender  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) that was first disclosed in early February has stunned the country's financial sector and has triggered a crackdown by regulators to unearth more such fraudulent deals.
According to the latest RBI data, obtained through a right-to-information request, 21 state-run banks which account for more than two-thirds of India's banking assets had as of Dec. 31 stressed loans of 8.26 trillion rupees, or 15.8 percent of their total loans.
Private sector lenders' stressed loan pile was about 1.1 trillion rupees, or 4.6 percent their total loans. Foreign banks' Indian operations had 144.26 billion rupees, or 4.1 percent of total loans, in stressed debt.

The company's shares fell as much as 6.2 percent but were trading just 1.7 percent lower at C$8.77 shortly after midday.
Hudson's Bay said on Sunday it was the victim of a security breach that compromised data on payment cards used at some stores in North America, and that it had ""taken steps to contain"" the breach.
Alex Holden, chief information security officer with cyber security firm Hold Security, said it was imperative that the Toronto-based company reaffirm its dedication to resolving the issue sooner rather than later.
""If they're able to assure their consumers and investors that this was a one time lapse in security and from now on they're going to be much more security conscious, they would emerge,"" Holden said.
""But it's not like you can just flick on the good security switch. It takes technology, it takes personnel and it takes resources. In the short-term, they're obviously going to see a drop in consumer confidence.""
Saks said in a statement on Monday that it took steps to contain the breach, and said it believed the issue no longer posed a risk to shoppers. The investigation was ongoing, it added.

""We wanted to reach out to our customers quickly to assure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges that may result from this matter,"" the statement said. ""Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring.""

Both the American benchmark stock gauge and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. aggregate bond index just posted a three-month loss for the first time since mid 2016. Emerging-market dollar debt slid, as did an index of commodities. Of major global assets, developing-nation stocks stood out as gaining -- but even they fell in both February and March.
The gloomy outlook is a sea change from recent years, when stocks, bonds and other assets rallied in unison against the backdrop of easy money and synchronized global growth. But markets have been roiled in recent weeks by concerns over tighter monetary policy, talk of a potential trade war and a sell-off in technology stocks.
“There isn’t always somewhere to hide,” David Schawel, chief investment officer at advisory firm Family Management Corp., wrote in a blog post. “To some degree, investors have become accustomed to a heuristic of ‘if stocks sell off, then bonds go up.’ While the flight-to-quality narrative does play out from time to time, it’s clearly not always true.”
Here’s a look at how some major assets disappointed in the first quarter:
Sorry Stocks
No matter where you put your money as a developed-market stock investor in the first three months of 2018, chances are you probably took a loss. In dollar terms, U.S. and German equities were particularly hard hit. A small gain in Japanese shares helped the main Asian gauge, but not enough to stop it from also finishing in the red.
Credit Clouds
Investors pulled about $9.7 billion out of exchange-traded funds that track global corporate bonds in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the biggest U.S. investment-grade ETF, that meant the worst quarter of outflows on record.
Those outflows showed up in returns data, with a Bloomberg Barclay's Index of U.S. corporate bonds posting a 2.3 percent loss for the first three months of the year.
Base Metals Weigh
The risk-off mood was good for gold, which climbed 1.7 percent in the three months through March. West Texas oil also also advanced, rising for the third quarter in a row on a combination of output cuts and robust demand.
But even with those gains, commodities couldn’t put in a positive performance in the period. Bloomberg’s index of raw materials finished the quarter 0.8 percent lower, weighed down by base metals in particular.
The commodity declines underscore the lack of places for investors to hide, according to Schawel.
“Going back the last 30 years, during the time periods where stocks and bonds both fell, commodities were positive five out of eight times, while gold was positive half of the time,” he wrote.
Silver Linings
Alongside gold, the Japanese yen -- another traditional safe-haven asset -- handed investors decent returns in the turbulent first three months of the year. Perhaps more surprisingly, some of the riskiest assets did as well.
Emerging-market local currency bonds returned almost 3 percent, while equities from developing nations also clung onto gains.
Investors, strategists and traders remain bullish on emerging assets for the rest of 2018 amid healthy economic conditions, a Bloomberg survey shows. Still, with U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist moves heating up, even this corner of global markets could face headwinds.
“From a tactical perspective, times like these typically cause the average investor to question their holdings and ask what should be done,” Schawel said. “Very few investors, even professional investors, have long-term success in timing the market over the short term.”"
698,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>",This could be the most critical week in Tesla's history,"To say  Tesla has entered rough waters of late would be an understatement.
Ahead of reporting first-quarter vehicle deliveries and earnings, the carmaker has been dealing with a flagging stock price, and Moody's downgrade of its debt into deep junk territory, and a fatal crash in California involving the company's Autopilot semi-self-driving system.
Some proactive communications on Tesla's part about details of the crash then drew a rebuke from the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident (the NTSB, better know for scrutinizing airplane accidents, also investigated a deadly 2016 Autopilot crash in Florida). Tesla declined to comment on the issue, which was  reported by The Washington Post.
And CEO Elon Musk celebrated the April Fools' weekend by firing off a couple of tweets about Tesla's ""bankruptcy"" and drinking too much tequila.
Analysts are expecting two things from deliveries and earnings (earnings won't come until early May, so investors may catch a breather): production of the mass-market Model 3 coming in well below Tesla's previous projections but possibly hitting about 2,500 a week for the very end of the quarter; and a massive loss on the financial side as the company struggles to get the Model 3 out the door.
Looking at the stock price, it's hard to tell whether the bad news has already been priced in. Tesla swooned in March before recovering slightly at the end of the month. Shares opened at $266 on Monday after rising over 3% on Friday.
Investors actually do seem to have digested the herky-jerky Model 3 ramp-up. Tesla said it would be building 2,500 vehicles a week by the end of its first quarter and 5,000 by the end of its second. It hasn't neatly achieved those goals, but prior to the Moody's downgrade and the Model X crash, shares didn't look as if they were going to drop from 2017 highs, and the expectation was that Tesla would be undertaking a capital raise by mid-2018.
And at the end of March, shareholders approved an ambitious new pay package for Musk that, if everything works out, would hinge on Tesla's market cap ascending to a staggering $650 billion. Big institutional investors approved the package, so the vote of confidence in Musk's leadership couldn't have been stronger.
What's really weighing on Tesla now isn't the slipping share price or the Autopilot crash — though the crash does bring up serious questions about why Tesla owners are evidently letting their cars drive themselves when the vehicles technically can't — but rather the company's messy balance sheet.
The auto industry is extremely capital intensive and almost always closely linked to debt markets. This is why major automaker such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) want to maintain investment-grade bond ratings. Tesla's debt is both complicated and pointedly far from investment-grade; its high-yield debt has been trading down (hardly a long-term vote of confidence), some additional debt on the balance sheet is convertible to equity, and when Tesla merged with SolarCity in 2016, it took on the company's hefty debt load.
The debt markets are now signaling a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to avoid bankruptcy down the line, while the equity markets are trying to figure out where Tesla will settle for the inevitable capital raise. Obviously, these factors are pulling Tesla in opposite directions: jittery optimism in the stock side, increasing pessimism on the debt side.
All eyes are focused on the car business as well. The energy-storage and solar-roof businesses won't lend any support to the stock. Execution on vehicles has been notably bad, so investors will want to see indications that Tesla is turning its Model 3 problems around.
If Tesla did surge to 2,000 to 2,500 in weekly Model 3 production for the final weeks of March, that could represent a rallying point for the stock and provide a runway for a capital raise. But the debt situation won't change, regardless of what happens at Tesla's factory.
That's worrisome because debt is what kills cars companies. And it kills them fast. It's impossible to keep the parts coming in and the vehicles rolling off the assembly lines if servicing the debt becomes job No. 1. After losing money for years, GM went bankrupt in about six months in late 2008 and early 2009.
Crisis creation seems to be baked in to Tesla's business model, so nobody should be surprised that the company is once again making things interesting. What's different this time, when you get right down to it, is that increasingly alarming junk debt. Keep an eye on it, no matter what happens with the stock price and the pace of vehicle production.

699,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>",Spotify is going public at a terrible time for tech stocks — but this chart should get investors excited,"Spotify is going public  at the worst possible time for tech stocks.
Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, and other public tech firms have all dragged the wider market down over the past week, amid Facebook's data scandal, Apple's poor iPhone X sales, and Amazon's getting caught in President Donald Trump's crosshairs. Facebook alone had  about $90 billion, or £64 billion, wiped off its market cap.
Spotify's first day on the New York Stock Exchange is already expected to be volatile, given investor questions about how a plucky but unprofitable streaming service can compete with its big, rich rivals Amazon and Apple. Come Tuesday, when Spotify is set to go public, the company will also be exposed to the wider turbulence in tech stocks.
Still, there are reasons to be cheerful. And one reason is this graph:
It shows Spotify's gross-margin percentage. The blue line shows Spotify's revenue in euros, and the red line shows Spotify's cost of revenue. Cost of revenue, in very simple terms, covers how much Spotify has to pay out to rights holders like record labels.
The biggest takeaway from this graph is that the gap between the two lines is getting bigger. That's good news. The white space shows Spotify has leverage with rights holders, financial discipline, and a growing number of people willing to pay to stream music. One caveat: The gross margin figure of 25%  comes from Spotify's financial outlook for the year and so isn't confirmed yet.
It's important to note how Spotify has done this. In the run-up to its direct listing, Spotify approached the biggest record labels and renegotiated how much money it paid them.
 As Business Insider explained in April, it's important for Spotify to demonstrate it has some control over this relationship. An early investor in Spotify has also said the firm had  another plan up its sleeve to reduce its reliance on the record labels that provide so much of its music: Offer artists a platform to reach fans directly.
There are still challenges, and the big one is whether Spotify can continue to persuade people to pay for music. Come Tuesday, investors can make their own bets."

702,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 06:13PM ET</span>",Tesla shares fall on worries about Model 3 production rate,"By Sonam Rai, Sruthi Shankar and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares slumped 5 percent on Monday as investors awaited production numbers for the closely watched Model 3, a cheaper vehicle that analysts see as crucial to the luxury electric automaker's long-term profitability.
A recent crash involving Tesla's autopilot technology and concerns about the company's ability to raise new capital also took a toll.
Tesla, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, declined to comment on production numbers for the Model 3, which are expected to be released this week.
The stock briefly pared losses after auto industry blogs - citing an unverified memo - reported that production of the Model 3 passed the 2,000 per week production rate. That would be short of Tesla's own target of 2,500 per week for the end of March but far above the 793 Model 3s built in the final week of last year.
""Musk himself is focusing time on Model 3 production because it is the ""highest priority,"" a Tesla spokesman said on Monday, saying that engineering chief Doug Field was focused on vehicle engineering.
The company's statement followed a report that Musk had taken charge of Model 3 production after several missed production deadlines.
In a series of tweets Musk said he had asked Field to manage both engineering and production to better align both businesses, a year earlier.
""Right now, tho(ugh), better to divide & conquer, so I'm back to sleeping at factory,"" he tweeted.
Some buy-side Tesla watchers questioned whether the company could sustain such numbers - if they prove to be true - and also worried about profitability. 
""There's been a number of things combined to impact the stock,"" said Tony Boase, senior research analyst with Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis. In addition to the Model 3 production rate, he cited a recent Moody's downgrade of Tesla's credit rating and the crash of a Tesla Model X and the company's comments since the crash.
""It comes down to the Model 3. That's the key,"" Boase said. ""If they can profitably build those cars that would be a huge step in the right direction.
""If you couldn't do (2,000) without using all the resources and at a decent margin level, what have you really achieved?"" he added.
Another investor who said he has profitably sold Tesla shares short four times in the last 18 months was also skeptical.
""Are they really at 2,000 or did they just stuff their system to achieve 2,000 for last week?"" said David Kudla, chief executive and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, who said he currently has no bets on Tesla.
""The only position I'd have on it is short because they aren't making any money. Their operating losses are growing. The stock's been overvalued for months,"" he said.
Tesla said on Friday that the Model X involved in a fatal crash in California last week had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks.
Tesla's shares closed down $13.65 at $252.48 on Monday, after earlier hitting their lowest level in just over a year. So far in 2018, the shares are down 19 percent, at a time when technology shares have suffered particularly as stock prices fall across the board.
Tesla has said it had about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the Model 3, but manufacturing bottlenecks since last July have delayed production and deliveries to customers, exacerbating the company's need for cash. 
Failure to meet targets and pressures on funding prompted Moody's downgrade last week, saying that Tesla was likely to raise more than $2 billion in new capital, partly to cover about $1.2 billion in convertible bonds due by March 2019.
Tesla still has loyal investors, including Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle, which has owned the stock since the company's initial public offering. 

""Historically, volatility has provided good entry points. Looking at it today we believe the demand outlook remains robust and unchanged,"" said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen. ""I still believe their product targets and outlook they've given in the past. While they've been optimistic on the timing they've always followed through.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street shares plunged on Monday as investors fled technology stocks amid resurgent trade war worries, with key indexes trading below their 200-day moving averages and the S&P 500 closing below that pivotal technical level for the first time since Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.
The first trading day of the second quarter began with a broad selloff concentrated in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, as losses by Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Tesla (O:TSLA) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), among others, took center stage from retaliatory trade measures China unveiled on Sunday.
With the S&P 500 in a 10 percent correction from its record high in late January, investors were increasingly concerned a nine-year bull market might be in danger of ending.
""It’s more complicated than just a tech selloff. What's hurting everything is that the S&P went through its 200-day moving average,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""That attracts momentum sellers and they don't care what the fundamentals are.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 458.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to end at 23,644.19 after dipping below its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 (SPX) fell 58.99 points, or 2.23 percent, to 2,581.88 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 193.33 points, or 2.74 percent, to 6,870.12.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, down 5.2 percent, as President Donald Trump continued his twitter attacks on the online retailer.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 closed lower, with the biggest losses seen by the consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and technology (SPLRCT) indexes, which were down 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq was dragged lower by Microsoft (O:MSFT), Intel (O:INTC), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Facebook (O:FB) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL).
Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) ended the day down 5.1 percent after the company was reported to be making 2,000 Model 3s per week, missing its 2,500 target.
The electric automaker's losses extend last week's near 14-percent decline as investigations of a fatal California crash and a Moody's credit downgrade weighed on the stock.
Health insurer Humana Inc's (N:HUM) shares closed up 4.4 percent on news it was in talks with Walmart (N:WMT) to expand their partnership or possibly be acquired by the retailer. Walmart stock fell 3.8 percent.
U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) fell to two-month lows as investors fled sliding stocks for safety ahead of Friday's closely watched jobs report.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.71 billion shares, compared to the 7.29 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

“Hedges against late cycle volatility bursts in credit, dispersion and cross-asset volatility as the equity/bond correlation itself becomes more volatile” are one key theme in  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s second-quarter outlook from strategists led by Kokou Agbo-Bloua, the firm’s head of flow strategy and solutions. The outlook was published March 30.
The report, titled “Macro ‘Black Mirror”’ after a U.K. television series that looks at unanticipated consequences of technology, warns that advances such as algorithmic trading are exacerbating trading issues with “profound distortions in market liquidity or the illusion thereof,” citing the volatility spiral in early February as an example.
The strategists also say that 2018 will be the first year since 2009 when net inflows of liquidity provided by all central banks will turn negative, setting the stage for regime change in both correlations and cross-asset volatility and risk premia.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Default rates at Indian companies likely to rise further: ICRA,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - More Indian companies are likely to default on their borrowings in the fiscal year that started in April compared with the previous year on higher interest costs and a deterioration in business conditions, according to rating agency ICRA.
The default rate for Indian companies rose to 3.4 percent in the fiscal year ended March from 2.6 percent in the previous year, ICRA, the subsidiary of global rating agency Moody's Investors Service, said in a report published on Monday.
""The default rate could go up in fiscal year 2019 on higher interest cost, deteriorating business conditions, likely difficulty in getting bank funding given the challenges in the banking system,"" said Jitin Makkar, head of credit policy at ICRA, in a webinar.
Besides huge stressed assets, banks are also likely to go slow on lending following the detection of more than $2 billion fraud at the country's second largest state lender, Punjab National Bank, which could eventually hit the economy that grew at 7.2 percent in October-December but still below 8 percent needed to hit full employment.
While the report showed that 646 companies were upgraded and 418 were downgraded, the trend did not mean that there was an improvement in the credit quality of the corporates given that the volume of debt downgraded at 3 trillion rupees ($46.08 billion) in the fiscal year ended March was sharply higher than 1.7 trillion rupees upgraded, ICRA said in the report.
Looking ahead, credit quality pressures will ""take longer to dissipate"" as hardening interest rates and banking sector woes will create hindrances for businesses, ICRA said.

Audi sold 597,000 vehicles in China, its biggest single market, last year.
The company last year resolved a dispute with dealers in China that could have disrupted the luxury carmaker's business in the world's biggest auto market.
The dispute stemmed from a long-term collaboration between Audi and SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) that had riled Audi store operators in China, who among others sell Chinese-made vehicles as part of Audi's existing joint venture with China's FAW Corp [SASACJ.UL].

745,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 04:39AM ET</span>","Indonesia says Go-Jek, Grab need to register as transport businesses","By Cindy Silviana
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is making it mandatory for Go-Jek and Grab to register as transport companies within two months to ensure they meet safety requirements as a public transport provider, potentially increasing costs and scrutiny of the ride-hailing firms.
The Southeast Asian nation and some other countries have been grappling with how to regulate ride-hailing companies. The App-based companies say they should not be treated as a public transport provider since they do not own cars or employ drivers.
But Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said on Monday the Indonesian government has finalised a new regulation to require ride-hailing companies to get a license from his ministry for providing public transport. The new rules would be discussed with all stakeholders ""within one or two days"", he told a news conference.
Go-Jek and Grab are the dominant ride-hailing providers in the country.
Budi Setyadi, director general of land transportation, said at the conference that once a ride-hailing company obtained a license it would need to follow the rules of a public transport provider.
A licensed public transport provider, among other things, must ensure that its vehicles regularly pass a safety test and its drivers have a special license for driving a public transport vehicle. These rules would only apply for car transport and not for motorcycles.
Grab Indonesia declined to comment and Go-Jek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The transport ministry issued a decree in 2016 to try to pressure companies to follow safety requirements, but faced resistance from ride-hailing companies which often say they only offer transportation services in partnership with drivers.
Several points in the decree were annulled by the Supreme Court last year.
The minister also pledged that the government would ensure competition in the ride-hailing sector after Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] deal to sell its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab.
Separately, Taufik Aryanto, a spokesman for Indonesia's monopoly regulator (KPPU), said once it had received notification and full information on the deal it would assess in 30 days whether any investigation was required.

The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said last week it has commenced an investigation into the deal and proposed interim measures that will require Uber and Grab to maintain their pre-transaction independent pricing.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Shares of ICICI Bank, India's third-largest lender, plunged 7 percent to a five-month low on Monday after media reported its lending practices were the subject of a police investigation.
ICICI Bank's shares were down 6.3 percent at 260.75 rupees as of 0541 GMT after declining to 258.80 rupees, their lowest since late October.
Police launched a preliminary inquiry about two months ago into Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI CEO Chanda Kochhar, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing sources. 
The probe also involves ICICI officials and Videocon Group, a consumer electronics and oil and gas exploration company. 
Last week, ICICI described as ""malicious and unfounded"" rumors circulating online alluding to conflicts of interest in ICICI's lending to Videocon and alleging that Kochhar favored the conglomerate.
In a statement, the bank's board said ""there is no question of any quid pro quo/nepotism/conflict of interest"" in its lending decisions, and expressed confidence in the CEO. 
India's banking sector is on edge after state-run Punjab National Bank said in February that it had unearthed a roughly $2 billion fraud. The case has stunned financial markets and led to heightened levels of shareholder concern around any wrongdoing at Indian banks.
Sentiment was also negative after the central bank fined ICICI 589 million rupees ($9.1 million) for not sticking to rules around the sale of government securities.
""While this fine will not have a material impact on earnings, it is negative on sentiment because other banks seem to have interpreted the rules correctly,"" said IDFC Securities in a research note to clients.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 05:38AM ET</span>",GM Korea's March sales dive; seeks to halt one shift at Bupyeong plant,"By Haejin Choi and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's South Korean unit has proposed suspending one of two shifts at a plant near Seoul, an internal union newsletter seen by Reuters showed, increasing uncertainty about the fate of the factory as the U.S. automaker grapples with slumping sales.
GM Korea said on Monday its domestic sales for March more than halved from a year earlier, deepening a decline in the aftermath of the announcement of planned restructuring of the money-losing operation.
The parent company said in February it would shut down its factory in the southeastern city of Gunsan and decide on the fate of its three remaining plants in South Korea amid mounting losses in the country.
""We have to fight so that the future of the No.2 assembly line (in the city of Bupyeong) does not follow that of the Gunsan factory,"" union workers at the assembly line said in the newsletter.
The newsletter showed the proposal to suspend the second shift at one of two factories in Bupyeong was made on Wednesday, during a meeting with union delegates at the plant.
A GM Korea spokesman said the firm is considering changing a shift system at the plant, but has not yet discussed the matter with the union. 
About 2,600 workers at GM Korea, equivalent to about 15 percent of its staff, have applied for a redundancy package that the U.S. automaker has offered as part of restructuring, union officials have said.
The spokesman said the No.2 plant, which makes Malibu sedans and Captiva sport utility vehicles (SUV) on the outskirts of Seoul, was running at 50 percent of capacity. The Bupyeong No.1 plant, however, which makes the Trax SUV, was operating at full capacity, he said.
GM Korea's exports have declined in recent years since the U.S. automaker pulled its Chevy brand from Europe, a major market for the Korean output.
""The proposal is worrisome,"" a union official told Reuters.
The plant is running at two shifts, but for only two days a week, and will see more declines in production, with the production of the Captiva to end this year, he said.
""The company's image is in free fall since it announced the plant shutdown. The company, not the union, is to blame,"" he said.
Rivals gain
While the automaker's presence in the South Korean market is small with most cars made there destined for export, the continuing decline in sales highlights reluctance among prospective customers to own GM vehicles, given the uncertainty about its operations, market-watchers said.
GM Korea posted a 58 percent drop in local sales for March to 6,272 units versus a year prior, the company said in a statement.
The automaker recorded total sales of 41,260 vehicles in March, including exports, compared with 50,850 a year earlier. Its domestic sales had plummeted by 48 percent for February, year-on-year.

Rivals gained, with Hyundai Motor Co increasing domestic sales by 6 percent and Kia Motors Corp's up 2 percent.

748,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>",China Unveils Plan to Lure Big Tech Stock Listings Back Home,"(Bloomberg) -- China took a major step toward seeing  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and others list in its domestic market, announcing a trial program that would allow the technology giants to see their shares bought and sold in the world’s most populous country.
The State Council unveiled the plans on Friday, less than a month after the idea was first made public -- underscoring how keen authorities are to see foreign-listed firms come home. A pilot of Chinese depositary receipts would apply to companies that went public overseas and have a market value of more than 200 billion yuan ($32 billion). Firms can use corporate structures that aren’t permitted on the mainland, and monies raised can be moved offshore. Some private companies will also find it easier to list shares.
While China has been a breeding ground for some of the world’s fastest-growing and highest valued tech businesses, companies such as e-commerce giant Alibaba and search engine firm Baidu have headed offshore, leaving the local market reliant on state-run industries. The CDR trial and easier listing rules may change that: analysts at China International Capital Corp. estimate that 35 foreign-listed and private companies may qualify, with prospects that they’ll raise as much as 1.5 trillion yuan in financing.
“There’s a strong desire to see local champions, these technology companies, come back onshore -- and CDRs is one way of doing this,” said David Smith, Asia head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Regulators first mooted the prospect of a CDR program at last month’s meeting of China’s rubber-stamp national legislature. The State Council didn’t say in the statement when the trial program would start.
The news could have global implications. While the likes of Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have headed to New York and Hong Kong, respectively, the prospect of at least a secondary listing in the world’s second-biggest equity market could significantly boost their valuations and set an example for other companies. And Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. stock suffered its worst month in more than a year in March, partly due to the increased threat from exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Reconsidering Plans
“High-tech and other innovative enterprises may, in light of the new CDR regime and ongoing competition between onshore and offshore equity exchanges, be reconsidering their IPO plans,” said John Xu, a Shanghai-based at the law firm Linklaters LLP. For example, a dual listing in China and an offshore market may now be realistic, he said.
That’s partly because the plans released Friday signal a loosening of a ban in mainland equity markets on variable interest entity structures, which have been used by many of China’s tech entrepreneurs to set up their companies. If VIE and dual-class structures are used for CDRs, that information should feature prominently in company prospectuses, the State Council said. The securities regulators should consult with other agencies and handle IPO applications from VIEs “prudently, based on varying circumstances.”

With these changes, CDRs may be establishing new norms, said Aberdeen’s Smith.
“If these VIE companies are available onshore, what does that mean for the structure?” he said. “While we won’t know for sure, it would seem to be one step closer to normalization, and this is something investors are watching closely.”
Expressed Interest
While no companies have said they will take part in the trial, the chiefs of several firms have previously expressed interest. Zhou Haibin, an analyst at Essence Securities, identified six foreign-listed companies that meet the plan’s thresholds: Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com Inc., NetEase Inc. -- which are all in New York -- and Hong Kong-listed China Mobile Ltd. and China Telecom Corp. CICC analysts led by Hanfeng Wang named Xiaomi Corp. and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial among unlisted firms that may qualify.
Private companies valued at more than 20 billion yuan and with revenue of 3 billion yuan or more in the past year will be eligible for the program, the State Council said, along with fast-growing unlisted companies that work in the field of advanced technology and have a leading advantage in their sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks began the new quarter on Monday with modest gains following a strong performance by global equities last week, while the dollar held steady ahead of key economic indicators.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 percent.
South Korea's KOSPI was flat and Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.5 percent. Shanghai was up 0.3 percent.
Wall Street surged last Thursday as technology stocks rebounded, ending a tumultuous first quarter on a high note.
Many major financial centers were closed for the Good Friday Easter holiday. Markets in Australia, Hong Kong, Britain and Germany remained shut on Monday while the U.S. market will resume trading.
MSCI's world equity index ended up 1.2 percent last week. But it lost about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, pushed away from record highs as tensions over global trade escalated, turmoil in the White House deepened and market-leading technology firms wobbled on fears of regulation and other issues.
""We expect strong and broad-based growth to continue globally,"" wrote strategists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
But they warned that there were looming risks: ""Trade protectionism, U.S. economic policy uncertainty, concerns about higher cross-market volatility and risk premium in core rates markets call for a more tactical approach to risk assets.""
While last month's fears of an all-out global trade war have abated somewhat, tensions between the United States and China over tit-for-tat tariffs kept investors on edge. 
China on Monday imposed tariffs on U.S. products including frozen pork, wine and certain fruits and nuts in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel.
In currencies, the dollar was steady at 106.350 yen, while the euro was almost unchanged at $1.2317.
The greenback had gained about 0.6 percent against a basket of six major currencies last week helped by a combination of factors including perceived progress on North Korea issues.
The dollar index still lost more than 2 percent last quarter, marking its fifth straight quarter of declines.
""A list of important indicators will be released this week, which could help steady market sentiment even though U.S.-China trade concerns and other geopolitical risks continue to linger in the background,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.
U.S. data due this week include Monday's Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index, Wednesday's ISM non-manufacturing index and the non-farm payrolls report on Friday.
Crude oil prices extended gains, lifted by a drop in U.S. drilling activity as well as by expectations that the United States could re-introduce sanctions against Iran. [O/R]
U.S. drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to March 29, bringing the total count down to 797. It was the first time in three weeks that the rig-count fell.
U.S. crude futures rose 0.3 percent to $65.14 a barrel and Brent advanced 0.5 percent to $69.67 a barrel.
""Investors took their cue from falling U.S drilling counts,"" Wang Xiao, head of crude oil research with Guotai Junan Futures said.

""But increasing trade friction between China and U.S. is likely to rock global markets and tarnish bullish sentiment in crude oil markets.""

The agency ""needs the cooperation of Tesla to decode the data the vehicle recorded,"" NTSB spokesman Chris O'Neil said in a statement. ""In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data.""
""However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla,"" he added.
A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.
The board's reaction to Tesla was first reported by the Washington Post Sunday evening. 
O'Neil was responding to Tesla's announcement on Friday that the Tesla Model X involved in the crash had activated its Autopilot system moments before the March 23 mishap.
The driver, 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, California. The mishap involved two other vehicles. 
""The NTSB is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver's previous concerns about the autopilot,"" said O'Neil. ""We will work to determine the probable cause of the crash and our next update of information about our investigation will likely be when we publish a preliminary report, which generally occurs within a few weeks of completion of field work.""
Last week, the company said that a search of its service records did not ""find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot. There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot's performance is unrelated to navigation.""
In its announcement on Friday, the company said that shortly before the crash, the vehicle's ""Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum.""
Autopilot allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free. 
In its Friday statement, Tesla also said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.

The statement did not say why the Autopilot system apparently did not detect the concrete divider.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) thought it had a deal with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on how much the company charged foreign affiliates for the rights to make and sell Coke products abroad.
Then in September 2015 a letter from the IRS arrived at Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters with a bill for back taxes whose amount, $3.3 billion, stunned the world's No. 1 soft drinks maker.
Coca-Cola sued the IRS, disputing the bill. The case is being tried now in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends, expected in mid-April.
    The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing, that is, the way companies value the goods, services, trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign units across national boundaries.
An important management discipline inside multinationals, transfer pricing is under more scrutiny than ever before from tax agencies worldwide because of strict new global standards, raising legal risks for companies and their investors.
The Coca-Cola case goes to trial as interest among corporations in seeking multi-year deals with the IRS covering transfer pricing arrangements has fallen in the past two years.
The IRS reported on Friday that it received 101 applications in 2017 for ""advance pricing agreements"" (APAs), similar to 2016's level of 98 in 2016, but well below 2015's peak of 183.
APA applications also fell in 2016 in Japan, the top U.S. bilateral APA partner, according to the latest data.
Anecdotal evidence suggests the APA process, designed to prevent conflict, is under strain in many countries, with some tax lawyers citing Mexico, Italy and China as challenging. 
Corporate tax directors at a conference in Washington earlier this month said APAs are taking longer to negotiate and government tax agencies are less willing to do them.
""We're really living in a different time and we can understand why tax authorities might be reluctant because there's a lot more external scrutiny than there ever was,"" said Amy Roberti, director of global tax and fiscal policy for Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), at the conference.
Asked for more details afterward, Roberti said through a company spokeswoman that APAs help Procter & Gamble build ""relationships with governments and fiscal authorities.""
The IRS did not immediately provide answers to questions about the Coca-Cola case and transfer pricing, in general. 
Coca-Cola responded to questions by providing an internal employee memo about the case that said, ""The company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies.""
TRANSFER PRICING CHALLENGE
The IRS contends that Coca-Cola charged several foreign affiliates royalties that were too low from 2007 to 2009, which reduced the parent company's U.S. income and resulted in underpayment of its U.S. income taxes by $3.3 billion.
Tax agencies often challenge transfer pricing arrangements on the grounds that they are set up to minimize income in high-tax countries and maximize it in low-tax countries.
Under a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework set up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016, one hundred national tax agencies including the IRS expect companies to use an ""arm's length"" approach to transfer pricing.
That means, in the case of trademark rights, for instance, charging foreign units royalties equal to their open market value. The trouble is that trademarks are usually unique. So approximating their ""arm's length"" price is difficult.
Coca-Cola says in court filings that the IRS approved the company's method for setting its transfer prices for the affiliates in a 1996 agreement, but that the IRS later withdrew that approval and issued the bill for back taxes.
Coca-Cola did not have an APA with the IRS. Instead, it had an APA-like ""audit closing agreement"" that dated back to 1996 and was, the company says, reaffirmed in later audits.
But much changed in transfer pricing over the more than 20 years since Coca-Cola reached its understanding with the IRS.
""It's an interesting case,"" said former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. ""If I were a tax director, I would be thinking about how much I can rely on agreements like this.

""It does drive home how important it is not to just assume that an agreement can be relied on forever because apparently, maybe not,” said Miller, now national director of tax at consulting firm Alliantgroup.

Singulato Motors, established in December 2014, covers businesses including NEVs, intelligent vehicle systems, and car networking services based on big data and cloud computing, according to its official website.
China began promoting electric cars in 2009 and aims to become a dominant global producer as it bids to curb vehicle emissions, boost energy security and promote high-tech industries.
A total of 777,000 NEVs were sold last year in China, the most anywhere, and the government aims to bring annual sales and output of NEVs to 2 million by 2020.
China's finance ministry will also extend a tax rebate on purchases of NEVs until the end of 2020, a boost for hybrid and electric carmakers.

This is the 20th consecutive month of gains, cementing a roaring recovery in the former Portuguese colony, after revenues plunged to five-year lows due to slowing economic growth and a widespread crackdown on corruption starting in 2014.
Figures from Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination bureau on Sunday showed revenues rose 22.2 percent to 26 billion patacas ($3.2 billion) versus analyst expectations of 13 percent to 18 percent growth. 
However, revenues still remain far off the highs reached in 2014, hovering only around monthly tolls seen in 2012, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 11:49AM ET</span>",India's electronics ministry moots duties on key smartphone component: sources,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Manoj Kumar
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is exploring new duties on the import of a key smartphone component, according to two government sources, the latest in a series of moves aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing in the world's second-biggest smartphone market.
India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has mooted a proposal to levy a 10 percent duty on the import of populated printed circuit boards (PCBs), two government officials told Reuters this week, declining to be named as the matter is not public.
A PCB is a bed for key components such as processors, memory and wireless chip sets that are the heart of an electronic device. Once populated with components, PCBs account for about half the cost of a smartphone. Currently, most manufacturers of smartphones import PCBs which are already loaded with components to India and then assemble them locally.
If India's finance ministry clears the recommendation on new duties, these could be levied in a matter of days, say government and industry sources, thus making populated PCB imports more expensive and pushing players to locally mount components instead.
India's finance, electronics and trade ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
In the near-term, such actions could spur players like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to widen their limited manufacturing and assembly capabilities in India and give an edge to those like Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and homegrown firm Lava, which already have machines to mount components onto PCBs.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China's OPPO is also putting up surface mounting machines in a new facility it is building in north India, a company executive told Reuters in a recent interview. The local unit of Foxconn, one of the biggest global contract manufacturers of electronics, also has the capability, according to two industry sources.
Foxconn was not immediately reachable for comment.
""This will be a step in a good direction. This is how full-scale manufacturing happens,"" said S.N. Rai, co-founder of Lava, adding the move will gradually also boost local production of components such as smartphone cameras and screens.
MANUFACTURING AMBITIONS
The move, if implemented, would be the latest step in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's phased manufacturing program (PMP), a plan unveiled in 2016 to step up local value addition every year in the smartphone manufacturing space.
About 134 million smartphones were sold in India last year, the world's second-biggest market after China.
Modi's government has since raised duties on a range of low-value items such as batteries and chargers and on imported phones.
Any move to impose duties on populated PCBs, however, could risk a backlash from several countries and heighten trade war concerns. China, Canada and the United States among others last week raised concerns at the World Trade Organization around India's imposition of duties on such devices.
In its annual budget last month, India's government outlined higher duties on products including imported smartphones and a range of components.
Modi hopes to turn India into a global manufacturing hub in a bid to boost growth and create tens of millions of new jobs.
While his flagship 'Make in India' drive is still a long way from delivering on lofty job promises, Modi has had some success with the PMP. Over 100 local factories currently assemble mobile phones and accessories like chargers, batteries, powerbanks and earphones in India, says tech research firm Counterpoint.
The PMP currently envisions local assembly of camera modules and printed circuit boards in the fiscal year beginning April 1, according to a public electronics ministry document.

""India has a plan to raise duties for all components bit by bit,"" said Tarun Pathak an associate director with Counterpoint, adding this will gradually force more domestic manufacturing.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>","Come for your drugs, leave with more shopping: Walmart's new growth strategy?","By Nandita Bose and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc’s (N:WMT) efforts to develop closer ties with health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), which came to light on Thursday, point to a brave new world of retail where superstores become healthcare centers offering basic medical care.
They are also aimed at boosting Walmart's slowing growth in brick-and-mortar store sales as it faces increasing pressure online from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). Deepening its existing partnership with Humana, or even acquiring the company outright, could be a step toward turning its 4,700 or so U.S. stores into healthcare centers that aim to attract more shoppers over 65.
""The end goal here is to get more people in their stores, get them to buy drugs and make an additional purchase while they are in the store,” said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.
If Walmart can offer “competitive rates” on primary care and other health services, he said, it “can grow traffic and push store visits.”
Walmart approached Humana this month, and the companies began to discuss closer ties focused on new partnerships, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. An acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also being discussed, the sources said. 
Walmart declined comment Friday. Humana could not immediately be reached for comment.
Closer ties between the two could enable the retailer to tap into Humana’s patient roster and possibly put some of its physician clinics in stores to offer medical care to customers.
Walmart is the largest retailer to hit upon the combination of retail and health insurance, but it is not the first. 
CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) has struck a $69 billion deal to acquire  Aetna Inc  (N:AET). Separately, insurer  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) has a $54 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits company Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX). The two deals, if approved, will put pressure on the entire health care supply chain. 
AMAZON CHECKMATE?
Humana could provide Walmart with “one more way to checkmate Amazon and equal and eclipse the CVS/Target partnership and equal and eclipse the CVS/Aetna partnership,” said Burt Flickinger at marketing consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.
“It allows them to get ahead of everybody from warehouse club operators like Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target and other retailers who run chain drugstores as well as food and drug combo operators like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Wegmans.”
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart already has pharmacies at many store locations and has a co-branded drug plan with Humana that caters to patients using Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over 65. That plan steers patients to Walmart stores for their pharmacy needs, offering customers an opportunity to save up to 20 percent on drug costs, analysts said. 
Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana is one of the country’s largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans - a type of coverage offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare.
Humana has 5.1 million seniors on prescription drug benefits and another 3.5 million on full medical benefits, according to Ana Gupte, senior health care analyst with Leerink Partners in New York. 
Walmart superstores “could be a one-stop shop for seniors,” said Gupte, adding that Humana already has about 50 pharmacies sharing locations with doctors’ clinics, and could expand that model using Walmart’s real estate and pharmacies. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
There is also a potential for Walmart and Humana to benefit from their mass of customer data, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. 
“One thing retailers have is a very good understanding of customers. They know their eating habits and other consumption patterns and that is quite useful in forming insurance decisions,"" he said. ""That is certainly something that Walmart would be able to leverage.” 
Humana patients are most likely already heavy shoppers at Walmart, according to David Friend at the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence and Innovation. 

""If you know that somebody is on a certain medicine you can sell them other products and services and that will help keep customer loyalty,"" he said.

Reports in many Indian media outlets in the past week have alleged that Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot invested 640 million rupees ($9.83 million) in Nu Power Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, after Videocon secured a loan from a consortium of banks, including ICICI.
ICICI, India's third-largest lender, has backed its CEO and said its board had ""come to the conclusion that there is no question of any quid pro quo/nepotism/conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumors"".
India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) launched a preliminary inquiry about two months ago to assess whether ""nepotism"" or ""criminality"" were involved, the two sources told Reuters, declining to be named. The investigation was ongoing, one source said.
ICICI Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot declined to comment.
In 2012, a consortium of more than 20 banks and other financial institutions approved loans of 400 billion rupees ($6.14 billion) to Videocon for debt consolidation, and an oil and gas capital expenditure program.
Of this, ICICI Bank provided 32.5 billion rupees after its own credit panel approved the loan, ICICI Bank said in a statement earlier this week, that it was ""important to note that Ms. Chanda Kochhar was not the chairperson of this committee"".
India's banking sector has been on edge in recent weeks after state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) said that it had discovered that bank officials had issued nearly $2 billion of fraudulent loan guarantees. The case has stunned financial markets and led to heightened levels of investor concern around any wrongdoing at Indian banks. 

It also comes at a time when Indian banks are struggling to tackle problems of record levels of bad loans on their books.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",Russian tycoon Magomedov arrested on embezzlement charges,"By Polina Nikolskaya and Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities on Saturday arrested billionaire Ziyavudin Magomedov on charges of embezzling more than $35 million, in one of the highest-profile prosecutions of a Russian tycoon in years.
Magomedov denied the charges at a pre-trial hearing, where a judge ordered that he be held in custody until May 30.
One of Russia's richest men, the 49-year-old Magomedov holds assets in construction and logistics through his sprawling Summa Group. He also has investments in U.S. tech ventures, including the Virgin One Hyperloop project, 
He was detained along with his business partner and brother, Magomed Magomedov, and Artur Maksidov, the head of a company in the Summa group that was involved in construction of a soccer World Cup venue in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
The hearing in Moscow's Tverskoy District Court was held to decide whether Magomedov and his associates should be detained pending trial.
The judge, Maria Sizintseva, said they acted as part of an organized crime group and had tried to put pressure on witnesses. She rejected an offer from Magomedov to put up a $35 million bail bond, and ordered he be detained. 
Citing the arguments against granting bail, the judge said Magomedov had access to his own aircraft, and assets abroad. The day before he was detained, he had booked a flight from Moscow to Miami, the judge said.
MUSCULAR STATE
Invited to speak from a metal cage in the courtroom, Magomedov, dressed in a dark-blue jogging suit, said: ""I categorically disagree with the charges presented.... The prosecution case does not stand up to scrutiny.""
He said he needed treatment in the United States for a medical problem, and offered to put up the $35 million bail. ""I'm willing to pull together this money, so no one has any thoughts that I might go on the run,"" Magomedov said.
Magomedov is part of a group of Russian multi-millionaires who, while publicly loyal to the Kremlin, are not in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.
Some members of the group say they are being squeezed by a tough economy, Western sanctions on Russia, and powerful state-run companies that are muscling in on nearly all sectors of the economy.
In past cases when magnates have been prosecuted, some in the Russia business community have said the tycoons were victims of a plot by the Kremlin or by politically connected business rivals - though the authorities deny that. 
People familiar with the Russian judicial system say high-profile corruption cases are rarely fabricated, but that the law is applied selectively, and that prosecutions can be influenced by outside factors.
Ziyavudin Magomedov ranked 63rd last year on the Forbes list of the richest businesspeople in Russia with $1.4 billion. In January, he was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as one of 96 ""oligarchs"" close to Putin. 
His Caspian Venture Capital fund has investments in ride-hailing service Uber ; Diamond Foundry, a company that produces man-made diamonds; and Peek, an online leisure activities company.
Magomedov is also co-executive chairman of Los Angeles-based tech firm Virgin Hyperloop One, which is chaired by Richard Branson. It is one of several firms developing a futuristic transport system that involves propelling people at high speed through sealed tubes.

He also co-owns the Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (MM:NMTP) with Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft (MM:TRNF_p) and transportation group Fesco (MM:FESH).

764,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 09:45PM ET</span>",U.S. judge certifies Goldman Sachs gender bias class action,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled that women accusing  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) of discriminating against them in pay, promotions and performance reviews may pursue their claims as a group in a class-action lawsuit.
The decision late Friday afternoon by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan covers female associates and vice presidents who have worked in Goldman's investment banking, investment management and securities divisions since September 2004, and employees in New York City since July 2002.
Goldman was accused of systematically paying women less than men, and giving them weaker performance reviews that impeded their career growth.
Class certification can help plaintiffs achieve greater awards at lower costs than if they sued individually. Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, estimated that more than 2,000 people are in the certified class.
Goldman had no immediate comment.
The lawsuit is one of the highest-profile cases targeting Wall Street's alleged unequal treatment of women, a claim raised in a variety of litigation against many banks for decades.
In her 49-page decision, Torres said the plaintiffs provided ""significant proof of discriminatory disparate treatment"" at Goldman.
She cited as an example an expert's report that female vice presidents and associates were on average paid a respective 21 percent and 8 percent less than their male counterparts.
The judge also said the plaintiffs provided proof that Goldman was ""aware of gender disparities and gender bias,"" but did not adjust its policies.
""We obviously are very, very pleased,"" Dermody said in a phone interview. ""This case is eight years old, and sometimes it's worth the wait.""
The plaintiffs were led by Cristina Chen-Oster, Mary De Luis and Allison Gamba, who were all vice presidents, and Shanna Orlich, who was an associate.
Torres said the class action will not include the claim that Goldman maintained a ""boys' club atmosphere"" where women were allegedly subjected to unwanted stereotyping, harassment and retaliation.
She said this was because ""individual"" rather than ""common"" issues would predominate.
The lawsuit began in September 2010, and according to Torres was delayed largely by a dispute over the kind of relief that former employees could obtain.

The case is Chen-Oster et al v. Goldman Sachs & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-06950.

The social media company said it would incur about $10 million of cash expenditure due to severance costs to be reflected in the current quarter ending March 31. 
As a result of the layoffs, primarily in its engineering and sales teams, the company said it sees savings of about $25 million in 2018.
The company had said it had 3,069 employees as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its annual filing https:// 
The Snapchat parent has been under pressure from investors to reduce costs after revenue fell short of analyst expectations during Snap's first year as a publicly traded company. 
Earlier this month, a company memo had shown that the company would cut just over 120 engineers and reorganize its engineering team, Reuters reported.
The Southern California-based company said the workforce reduction ""is to align resources around our top strategic priorities and to reflect structural changes in our business.""

The deal comes as Mediaset's struggling pay-TV business is rethinking its business model, and broadcasters in general are tuning their strategies to fend off competition from online content providers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 
Mediaset said in a statement the deal would allow it to broadcast its pay-TV Premium Cinema and TV series channels on Sky's satellite platform. 
In turn, the agreement would allow Sky Italia to use Mediaset's Premium pay-TV digital platform for its own offering of services and channels.
On Thursday, Sky Italia signed a long-term deal with broadband company Open Fiber that will allow it to offer internet TV in Italy. 
""The agreement reached today... ensures that both companies will enjoy a number of benefits... both operators will achieve optimisations that guarantee a new multi-platform scope and wider access for their respective clients to high-quality TV products,"" the statement said. 
Mediaset's Premium business, with under 2 million subscribers, has struggled to make a return on its large investments for broadcasting rights to Champions League and Italian Serie A soccer matches, and over time it has lost market share to Sky, its major competitor.
The Milan-based TV group, controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, had agreed to sell Premium to France's  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) in 2016, but the deal collapsed, locking the two groups into a bitter legal battle. 
The failed agreement prompted a change in Premium's strategy, shifting it towards on-demand offerings and moving to a strategy that relied less on expensive, premium sporting content.
""If you don't make alliances over pay TV to enrich the content offered to clients, other players, like Netflix, will come and eat you up,"" a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The statement added that the accord gave the Milan-based TV group the option to hand over to Sky Italia, between November and December of this year, full control of a newly created company, to which the technical, maintenance and operational assets of Premium would be transferred. 
""The two groups are 'smelling' each other to see if they get along for future agreements,"" the source said. 
The statement added that the potential sale of the share in the new company would not mean discontinuing Mediaset Premium's services, ""which will continue to manage its offer and its client base.""

Sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that Germany's flagship bank had begun looking for a new CEO to replace Cryan to mollify investors frustrated by the slow turnaround of the loss-making lender.
Cryan said in a staff memo on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely committed"" to the lender. But Achleitner, who the sources said had initiated the search for a new CEO, has remained silent. 
Without citing its sources, Spiegel said Achleitner had already held talks with Zeltner, who left UBS in December after more than three decades at the Swiss bank, hoping to prepare a change by the annual shareholders meeting on May 24.
 Deutsche Bank  declined to comment.
Zeltner is credited with leading a push by UBS into Asia Pacific, which has become an important growth driver, contributing nearly a third of third-quarter operating income in the wealth management division.
Separately, WirtschaftsWoche weekly and the Wall Street Journal reported that veteran banker John Thain was a candidate to join the board of Deutsche Bank, with other changes also planned. The bank also declined comment on that.
The German magazine cited sector experts as predicting that Thain would support Achleitner's strategy to continue to lead Deutsche as a global investment bank.
Thain headed Merrill Lynch before it was sold to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) at the height of the financial crisis and served as chief operating officer at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), where Achleitner also worked earlier in his career.

Thain, who began his banking career in 1979, formerly headed the New York Stock Exchange and engineered a series of mergers that shaped it into NYSE Euronext by 2007.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A union of cabin workers for LAN Express, a subsidiary of LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM), said it had failed to reach agreement on a labor contract and had voted to strike as early as Tuesday.
The union, which includes nearly 1,000 of the airline´s crew workers, said in a statement late on Thursday that a strike would ""paralyze"" local and regional flights throughout LATAM´s service region.
The walk-off could be delayed until April 9, the union said, should either side request a five-day period of government-facilitated mediation.
The vote follows several months of negotiations and was approved by 95 percent of the union´s workers, the statement said.
LATAM Airlines was not immediately available for comment.
The union said it had failed to reach agreement with management on key issues that include rotation lengths and salaries for newly hired workers.
LATAM was founded in 2012 through a tie-up between Chile's LAN and Brazil's TAM. In December, Qatar Airways completed an acquisition of 10 percent of the company in a transaction worth $608 million.
LATAM operates in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.

NYSE may pay about $70 million for CHX, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
CHX declined to comment while NYSE did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
CHX said earlier in March it was looking for new potential buyers after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission killed a roughly $25 million deal in February, ending a two-year effort by the exchange to sell itself to a consortium led by China's Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group and its U.S. affiliate North American Casin Holdings.

The politically sensitive deal was originally approved by the SEC staff, but the agency's commissioners, led by Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump, stayed the decision pending their own review nL2N1QO1D0.

777,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",EU Resists Linking U.S. Metal-Tariffs Waiver to Revival of TTIP,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union distanced itself from the idea of reviving talks on a broad free-trade agreement with the U.S. as part of EU efforts to gain a permanent exemption from President Donald Trump’s controversial import tariffs on steel and aluminum.
A day after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Trump administration is willing to restart negotiations on the stalled Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the European Commission said it’s seeking a “dialog” with Washington “on issues of common interest” including global steel overcapacity.
“More contacts will be held in the coming weeks to agree the exact scope and framework of this EU-U.S. dialog,” a spokesman for the commission, the 28-nation EU’s executive arm in Brussels, said on Friday. “The commission is committed to engage in this process in an open and constructive way. However, it should be clear that this dialog does not represent the revival of the process for a comprehensive Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.”
The TTIP negotiations to expand the world biggest economic relationship have been frozen since Trump entered the White House with an “America First” agenda that has shunned multilateral trade initiatives. This extended to the completed Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Trump withdrew.
“He terminated the trans-Pacific deal; he didn’t terminate TTIP,” Ross said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “That was meant quite deliberately and quite overtly as a message that we’re open to discussions with the European Commission.”
Tit-For-Tat
European trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom and Ross spoke four days ago with their eyes on a May 1 deadline for Trump to decide whether to prolong an exclusion for the EU from U.S. import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
The White House justified the levies introduced a week ago on national-security grounds dismissed by the EU, which has demanded a permanent exemption and threatened to join China in applying tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods and complaining to the World Trade Organization.
Trump set a vague condition for prolonging the metal-tariffs waiver beyond May 1: The status of “discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to U.S. national security.”
EU leaders showed as much annoyance as relief at the temporary exemption on March 23, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying “we won’t talk about anything while there’s a gun pointed at our head.”

After 14 months of the Trump administration, EU officials are skeptical that it would be willing to seek the kind of broad market-opening TTIP deal that the bloc was negotiating with the government of former President Barack Obama.
In May last year, Malmstrom refused to rule out the possibility of a free-trade accord between the EU and the U.S. while stressing that the planned TTIP had been left “in the freezer” as a result of Trump’s election.
“There’s still a case for an ambitious trade agreement between us, not to mention a huge potential,” Malmstrom said in a speech at the time. “But we both need a bit more time, and to know there was shared ambition and common ground.”"

Failure to meet the deadline gives Toshiba the option of walking away from the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips without penalty - a move that some investors have urged it to consider.
But the company said in a statement that it still plans to sell the unit, aiming to finalize the deal as soon as possible.
Toshiba agreed last year to sell the chip unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital to cover liabilities arising from its bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.
But the conglomerate no longer needs the funds as much, having raised $5.4 billion from a share issue to foreign investors late last year.
Some activist shareholders oppose the sale, saying the $18 billion price tag undervalues the business and that Toshiba should renegotiate with the Bain group or consider an initial public offering.
The chip business currently accounts for most of the company's profit, and Toshiba is struggling to grow other core businesses such as social infrastructure.

Under the deal, it plans to repurchase 40 percent of the chip unit.

Large cap stocks, which led gains in 2017, are among the biggest decliners, while beaten down small caps are staging their best rally in more than two years. Government bonds snapped a five-quarter losing streak as fears of tighter liquidity failed to materialize. Even the currency surprised, blasting past the most bullish analyst forecast.
Big caps were too ""overcrowded,"" while government plans to boost development of the new economy sector increased the allure of smaller tech stocks, said Ken Chen, a Shanghai-based strategist with KGI Securities. ""In the coming quarter we see more balanced opportunities in blue chips and small caps though, as MSCI’s inclusion of A shares will support blue chips.""
MSCI will add large-cap A shares to its benchmark indexes in two stages in June and September, which the index compiler projects will spur $17 billion of inflows. Complicating the outlook is China’s plan to allow its overseas-listed tech giants to have a presence on mainland bourses, which could draw huge inflows from existing equities.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) had their strongest start ever in the first quarter of 2018, totaling $1.2 trillion in value, as U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe unleashed many companies' dealmaking instincts.
Strong equity and debt markets and swelling corporate cash coffers also helped boost the confidence of chief executives, convincing them that now is as good a time as ever to pursue transformative mergers, dealmakers said.
""The clarity on tax has unclogged some of the M&A activity that was strategically imperative, but companies were waiting for the right financial timing,"" said Anu Aiyengar, head of North America M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM). 
While the value of M&A deals globally increased 67 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2018, the number of deals dropped by 10 percent to 10,338, preliminary Thomson Reuters data show, reflecting how deals on average are getting bigger.
Among the largest deals clinched this quarter were U.S. health insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp's $67 billion deal to acquire U.S. pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) and German utility E.ON SE's (DE:EONGn) $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG's (DE:RWEG) renewable energy business  Innogy SE  (DE:IGY).
M&A volumes doubled in Europe in the first quarter, while the United States was up 67 percent and Asia was up 11 percent. 
""The better macro-economic environment in Europe has created greater confidence to get things done. Deals that have been in the works for a long time are now coming to fruition and some industries like utilities are being completely reshaped by the latest wave of consolidation,"" said Borja Azpilicueta, head of EMEA Advisory at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA).
In the United States, the stock market rally was thwarted in the first quarter by U.S. President Donald Trump's announcements on trade tariffs on Chinese imports. Corporate valuations are still elevated, but market volatility has increased.
""Companies have become more aggressive in pursuing deals that make strong strategic sense. But valuations remain high and boards have recently become more cautious on large acquisitions, as it is more difficult to convince their investors of the potential for value creation at such price levels,"" said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
Regulatory risk has also increased. Trump's dramatic intervention that blocked Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's (O:AVGO) $117 billion hostile bid for U.S. chip maker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on grounds of national security earlier this month underscored heightened U.S. concerns about losing out to China in the race for new technologies.
""While every auction used to see at least one Chinese participant, now people are questioning their ability to deliver and are conscious of the political pushback that Chinese bidders could face,"" said Johannes Groeller, a partner at  PJT Partners Inc  (N:PJT).
On the antitrust front there is also some uncertainty. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block U.S. telecommunications company AT&T Inc's (N:T) $85 billion deal to buy media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) over concerns about how the two companies would consolidate their sectors.
""The antitrust environment for M&A transactions seems favorable today though certain deals, which catch the attention of regulators or politicians for one reason or another, can be problematic,"" said Jack Levy, a partner at Centerview Partners Holdings LP.

""One should resist the temptation to conclude from those specific deals that the antitrust regime has become more difficult,"" Levy added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Global accounting firm KPMG has suffered a major setback in its battle against liquidators of former U.S.-listed healthcare firm China Medical Technologies Inc, whose executives have been charged in the U.S. with defrauding investors out of over $400 million.
The China Medical case is the most high-profile and closely watched contest in years over the production of Chinese audit work papers, an issue that has put Hong Kong and U.S. regulators at loggerheads with China - and at one point threatened to leave U.S.-listed Chinese firms unaudited and in danger of delisting.
In a previously unreported ruling made last week, Hong Kong's High Court rejected a KPMG procedural request that would limit the time in which China Medical liquidators can pursue claims against KPMG for losses and damages for its audits of the now-defunct company.
The ruling also paves the way for proceedings on a contempt summons brought against 91 KPMG partners and former partners issued in November for refusal to comply with a High Court order to produce China Medical's audit work papers.
A substantive hearing on that action is widely expected later this year.
KPMG and mainland associate KPMG Huazhen have refused to comply with a 2016 Hong Kong High Court order to provide copies of audit work papers to Borrelli Walsh Ltd, China Medical's liquidator, arguing it would violate China's national security laws.
Deputy High Court Judge Anthony To, in last week's decision, wrote that KPMG's refusal to hand over the papers made it ""extremely difficult"" for liquidators ""to determine whether or not to commence proceedings against KPMG"".
KPMG in Hong Kong, that signed off the audits, has claimed it does not have the papers. KPMG Huazhen has allowed liquidators to examine some of China Medical's papers on site under the supervision of the auditor's personnel and attorneys, a situation Judge To characterized as ""unworkable"".
KPMG did not respond to telephone calls and emails seeking comment. Borrelli Walsh declined to comment.
China Medical was placed into liquidation in 2012 by courts in the Cayman Islands, New York and Hong Kong, following accusations the NASDAQ-listed firm was a fraud.
Company liquidators have presented evidence showing the company's former management had stolen at least $355 million through fake technology acquisitions. Reuters has been unable to contact the accused or their representatives for comment.
KPMG was China Medical's auditor between 2005 to 2009, and provided unqualified audit opinions for financial statements of the firm and its subsidiaries during that period.
KPMG faces a myriad of legal and regulatory problems, said Paul Gillis, professor of practice at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.
""KPMG used its letterhead on the audit report and they didn't do the work,"" Gillis said, referring to KPMG signing off audit work by KPMG Huazhen. ""By claiming they did the (sign-off) work, they made it impossible to argue they don't have access to work papers.""
Judge To, in his judgment provided a stinging rebuke of KPMG's refusal to cooperate with the liquidators.

""It is disingenuous for KPMG to argue that it cannot comply with the court orders because its associate KPMG Huazhen will not comply with KPMG's request,"" Judge To wrote.

They cut their suggested equity allocations to 70 percent from 76.3 percent a month earlier, according to a poll of eight China-based fund managers conducted this week.       
The fund managers have maintained their suggested bond allocations for the coming three months at 8.8 percent.
They have boosted recommended cash allocations to 21.3 percent from 15 percent in the previous month.  
""Market participants are starting to worry about (China's) economic growth and liquidity conditions for the whole year of 2018, given the fallout from China-U.S. trade tensions, financial regulations and Beijing's deleveraging efforts,"" said a South China-based fund manager. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods may not be imposed until early June, administration officials said on Wednesday, with public consultations and potential tariff revisions buying time for negotiations to forestall them.
China warned the United States on Thursday not to open Pandora's Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe, even as Beijing pointed to U.S. goods that it could target in a deepening Sino-U.S. trade dispute. 
""There have been many uncertainties recently, including China-U.S. trade spat and rate hike by the U.S. Fed,"" said another fund manager, adding that it could be hard for small- and mid-cap firms to extend recent strong gains as their valuations are not cheap. 
Overall, the fund managers surveyed held relatively balanced views on asset allocations for the next month, with two favoring an increase, two suggesting a cut, while four recommended the same level of equity exposure.
According to the poll, average recommended allocations for electronic and consumer stocks in the next three months continued to climb, while those for cyclical plays including financial and real estate firms were lowered. 
Growth stocks, in particular tech firms, have gained momentum as Beijing pledged a great deal of support for the development of ""unicorns"" and other firms in emerging industries, including ""green light"" for their initial public offerings in the A-share market, a fund manager pointed out. 
That came as Beijing puts more focus on the quality of its economy as it seeks new growth drivers to power the economy. 
The selling pressure in financial and real estate stocks remained heavy, and investors should avoid the manufacturing and financial sectors which could be hit hard in case of a full-blown China-U.S. trade war, the fund managers added.
Average recommended allocations for electronic stocks in the next three months were boosted to 16.3 percent from 15.9 percent the previous month, those for consumer shares were raised to 29.6 percent from 28.1 percent, while those for financial firms were reduced to 15 percent from 18.8 percent last month.

791,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 12:02AM ET</span>",BOJ Bid to Taper by Stealth Made Tougher by Supercharged Yen,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan is finding out just how hard it is to be stealthy -- when everyone is looking right at you.
The central bank looks set to end this fiscal year well behind on its target for Japanese government bond purchases. But having inadvertently sparked a yen rally in January, a repeat of this “stealth taper” of monetary policy in 2018 is going to prove a much tougher challenge.
“The hurdle is higher this year than last year when the BOJ was able to taper stealthily without a problem,” said Naoya Oshikubo, rates strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities Japan Ltd. “The main scenario is for the BOJ to keep reducing in line with a drop in government debt issuance in fiscal 2018. But unlike last year they are more sensitive to the currency, so cuts will be gradual and cautiously timed with an eye on that.”
The BOJ is expected to keep buying ranges unchanged for a second month when it announces its April plan later on Friday. Its net bond purchases have totaled around 54 trillion yen ($508 billion) in fiscal 2017, compared with an annual guideline of 80 trillion yen under a policy in which it buys government debt to keep 10-year bond yields around zero percent.
Taper Tantrum
Despite the steady reduction in purchase amounts, Japan’s benchmark 10-year yield has moved largely within target this fiscal year, with a few upward blips. But the central bank unintentionally kicked off a rally in the yen on January 9 when it unexpectedly cut purchases of long term bonds, sparking a slew of bets on speculation the reduction signaled its ultra-loose policy could end sooner than expected.
Since then, the yen has strengthened about 6 percent against the dollar despite repeated remarks from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that the BOJ will keep policy accommodative. A weaker dollar and domestic political concerns have also bolstered the currency. Hedge funds are the most bullish they have been in almost a year, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
“The BOJ is in an extremely difficult situation, putting yields from 10 years and longer at risk of sinking below zero,” said Akio Kato, general manager of trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Under normal circumstances, the BOJ should be buying less given where yields are, but it can’t, with the yen at a much stronger level than many had projected.”
Japan’s 10-year yield was steady at 0.04 percent on Friday, having fallen from a year-to-date high of 0.095 percent on Jan. 30.
Peer Pressure
The BOJ remains behind its global peers, who are either raising interest rates or turning toward normalizing policy. But with Japanese inflation still far from its 2 percent target, the bank insists a change to policy is in no way imminent.
Should currency markets stabilize, the BOJ will prioritize scaling back purchases of 5-10 year maturities, according to Oshikubo. After “normalizing” the sector that has the biggest impact on its zero-rate target, it is then expected to focus on super-long bonds where the curve has been flattening, he said.
For now, trade tensions triggered by the U.S. protectionist stance and uncertainty over the stock market’s outlook are weighing on bond yields, only adding to the BOJ’s headaches.
“They are in a catch-22 situation,” said Hidenori Suezawa, chief fixed-income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “It’s unlikely the BOJ will boost buying, but it can’t reduce it either as it puts further downward pressure on yields.”

The rate has remained unchanged for the fourth straight quarter, despite the ongoing store closures, the report said. The vacancy rate was 9.9 percent a year earlier. 
On an annual basis, 32 of 77 primary metros had a higher vacancy rate in the first quarter, the report said.
Net absorption for retail neighborhood and community centers, measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, fell 83.7 percent to 453,000 square feet.
Although many metros will face continued pressure in 2018 with Toys 'R' Us, Bon-Ton, Aerosoles and J. Crew closing stores, new occupants have filled a number of these spaces, according to the report.
Only 712,000 square feet of new construction was completed in the quarter, a 74.4 percent drop from a year earlier.
Asking rents per square foot for retail neighborhood and community centers rose 1.9 percent, while effective rent per square foot rose 2.1 percent, the real estate research firm said.
The recently enacted Tax Reform and Jobs Act may improve discretionary income, providing a boost to consumer confidence and the overall retail sector, the report said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) executive said in an internal memo in 2016 that the social media company needed to pursue adding users above all else, BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday, prompting disavowals from the executive and Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. 
The memo from Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, had not been previously reported as Facebook faces inquiries over how it handles personal information and the tactics the social media company has used to grow to 2.1 billion users.
Zuckerberg stood by Bosworth, who goes by the nickname ""Boz,"" while distancing himself from the memo's contents. Bosworth confirmed the memo's authenticity but in a statement he disavowed its message, saying its goal had been to encourage debate.
Facebook users, advertisers and investors have been in an uproar for months over a series of scandals, most recently privacy practices that allowed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to obtain personal information on 50 million Facebook members. Zuckerberg is expected to testify at a hearing with U.S. lawmakers as soon as April.
""Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement.
Bosworth wrote in the June 2016 memo that some ""questionable"" practices were all right if the result was connecting people.
""That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends,"" he wrote in the memo, which BuzzFeed published on its website. 
He also urged fellow employees not to let potential negatives slow them down. 
""Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people,"" he wrote. 
Bosworth said Thursday that he did not agree with the post today ""and I didn't agree with it even when I wrote it. 

""Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas, if only to eliminate them,"" Bosworth's statement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) has agreed to pay $100 million to end private U.S. litigation accusing it of conspiring to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate, becoming the fourth major bank to settle.
The preliminary accord with ""over-the-counter"" investors that transacted directly with banks on a panel to determine Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, was disclosed in filings on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Court approval is required.
Settlements with the OTC investors total $590 million so far, and include $120 million with  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), $130 million with  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and $240 million with  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn).
HSBC denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the risks, costs and distraction of litigation, court papers show.
A spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
Banks use Libor to set rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and determine costs of borrowing from each other.
Investors including the city of Baltimore and Yale University in Connecticut had accused 16 banks of conspiring to manipulate Libor. The private litigation began in 2011.
Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide.
Last July, the head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data to underpin it.

The case is In re: Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-md-02262.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico board must bring creditors to table: U.S. lawmaker,"By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources censured Puerto Rico's federally-appointed oversight board on Thursday over delays in the island's debt restructuring, the latest sign of discord over how to fix the bankrupt, storm-ravaged U.S. territory.
In a letter to the board seen by Reuters - which was created by U.S. Congress in 2016 to manage Puerto Rico's finances - Utah Republican Rep. Rob Bishop said it had not done enough to engage with Puerto Rico's financial creditors on a massive debt restructuring, nor enforce much-needed structural reforms in Puerto Rico.
""I remain frustrated with the oversight board's inability and unwillingness to reach consensual restructuring agreements with holders of Puerto Rico's debt,"" he said.
The island is navigating both the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years in September's Hurricane Maria. The storm killed dozens and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, while thousands of Puerto Rico's 3.3 million residents remain without power more than six months later.
CURIOUS TIMING
Bishop's frustration echoes that of bondholders. In a Wednesday statement, Dominic Frederico, chief executive of Assured Guaranty Ltd, which insures Puerto Rican debt, urged the board ""to work with creditors to create a sustainable economic recovery plan based not on political agendas but on the oversight board’s only mandate: to support economic stability in Puerto Rico.""
Yet Bishop's letter comes at a curious time, just a day after the board indicated it would take a hard line on structural reforms. 
In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello on Wednesday, the board demanded harsh pension cuts and labor reforms as conditions for approving the governor's fiscal turnaround plan, measures Rossello later vowed to resist.
With the plan still pending - and with warring creditor groups locked in litigation over competing claims to Puerto Rico's cash - the board can only do so much to facilitate a debt workout.
UNILATERAL PLAN 
But Bishop's letter may have been written with an eye toward the future, one committee aide said. 
If the board and Rossello cannot agree on a fiscal turnaround plan, the board has the authority to implement one unilaterally. With tensions mounting, and that scenario looking increasingly likely, ""it would be prudent for the board to include creditors in those conversations,"" the aide said. 
In the committee's view, creditor support is the biggest key to helping Puerto Rico regain access to capital markets - even at the expense of support from Rossello, said the aide who requested anonymity.
The turnaround plan is a key document because the economic projections contained in the plan will determine how much money Puerto Rico has to pay debt, and thus how much creditors will recover.
To be sure, a unilateral plan would likely perpetuate already-costly litigation over Puerto Rico's financial future. Rossello could resist implementing the board's plan, and the board could then sue to enforce it. That scenario has precedent, with the board having sued Rossello in August after he refused to impose board-ordered furloughs.

Rossello's latest draft plan, which the board has not approved, forecast $6 billion in debt service capacity over the next five years.

(Reuters) - 
U.S. retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is in early-stage talks with health insurer  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) about developing closer ties, with the acquisition of Humana being discussed as one possibility, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Should the talks lead to a tieup, it would be the latest deal to bring together a retail chain and a health insurer in the last few months, following CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp's $69 billion deal to acquire  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) and Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp's $54 billion deal to buy Express Scripts Holding Co.
Walmart approached Humana earlier this month and the deliberations are preliminary, two of the sources said. While the conversations have focused on new partnerships, an acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also something being discussed, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Humana and Walmart declined to comment.
Walmart and Humana have market capitalizations of $264 billion and $37 billion, respectively.
An acquisition of Humana would represent a significant strategic shift for Walmart, which is the world's largest retailer and has been focused on fending off Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in online shopping.
Amazon has also been looking at entering the healthcare sector. Earlier this year, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), said they would form a company aimed at cutting healthcare costs for their U.S. employees.
""The risks (for Walmart) of becoming entangled in the complex U.S. healthcare industry are considerable, especially at a time when Walmart is grappling with the competitive challenges of a rapidly shifting retail market,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note.
""The hammering out of any agreement, which would be Walmart's largest ever corporate deal, would, of itself, be an enormous distraction,"" Saunders added.
Walmart currently has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores. The partnership offers a prescription drug plan that can save up to 20 percent in drug costs for customers. 
Closer ties between the two companies could allow Walmart to tap into Humana's patient population, expanding low-level medical services in its pharmacies to avoid ER visits. They could allow it to better manage prescription drug use though access to medical records.

Humana's biggest business is managing Medicare Advantage health plans for older and disabled people, a heavily regulated business that Walmart would have to take on in an acquisition.
Memberships in retail Medicare Advantage plans - where individuals sign up directly with Humana - rose about 1 percent to 2.86 million, as of Dec. 31. Employer or other group-based Medicare Advantage membership climbed 24 percent to 441,400.
Last month, Walmart reported a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the critical holiday period and forecast annual profit at the lower end of expectations.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and other coffee sellers must put a cancer warning on coffee sold in California, a Los Angeles judge has ruled, possibly exposing the companies to millions of dollars in fines.
A little-known not-for-profit group sued some 90 coffee retailers, including Starbucks, on grounds they were violating a California law requiring companies to warn consumers of chemicals in their products that could cause cancer. 
One of those chemicals is acrylamide, a byproduct of roasting coffee beans that is present in high levels in brewed coffee.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said in a decision dated Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies had failed to show there was no significant risk from a carcinogen produced in the coffee roasting process, court documents showed.
Starbucks and other defendants have until April 10 to file objections to the decision.
Starbucks declined to comment, referring reporters to a statement by the National Coffee Association (NCA) that said the industry was considering an appeal and further legal actions. 
""Cancer warning labels on coffee would be misleading. The U.S. government’s own Dietary Guidelines state that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle,"" the NCA statement said.
In his decision, Berle said: ""Defendants failed to satisfy their burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health.""
Officials from Dunkin’ Donuts (O:DNKN), McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), Peet's and other big coffee sellers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The lawsuit was filed in 2010 by the Council for Education and Research on Toxics (CERT). It calls for fines as large as $2,500 per person for every exposure to the chemical since 2002 at the defendants’ shops in California. Any civil penalties, which will be decided in a third phase of the trial, could be huge in California, which has a population of nearly 40 million.
CERT's lawyer Raphael Metzger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Starbucks lost the first phase of the trial in which it failed to show the level of acrylamide in coffee was below that which would pose a significant risk of cancer. In the second phase of the trial, defendants failed to prove there was an acceptable ""alternative"" risk level for the carcinogen, court documents showed.

Several defendants in the case settled before Wednesday's decision, agreeing to post signage about the cancer-linked chemical and pay millions in fines, according to published reports.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors drained the most cash from the stock market since early February's market meltdown, dodging declines while making a tactical bet on fallen technology companies, Lipper data released on Thursday showed.
More than $14 billion rolled out of the funds during the week ended March 28, according to the research service, yet tech sector funds pulled in $101 million as some investors appeared to bet that the declines in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and some of its peers were temporary.
Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, said the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc - were ""bloodied and black-eyed"" this week but the selling pressure made it a buying opportunity.
U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon on Thursday of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business.
The company's stock sank more than 6 percent over the past week. Amazon declined to comment on Trump's tweet on Thursday.
""These market darlings have had a strong ride for so long and this mini-tech wreck or breather is kind of what we needed,"" said Roseen.
INTERNATIONAL STOCKS PUNISHED
During the latest week, U.S. investors also turned on international stocks, which have been a popular place to sock away gains from the domestic market. Non-domestic equity funds recorded $340 million in withdrawals during their first week of outflows this year.
European stock funds posted $1.2 billion in withdrawals, their fourth straight week of outflows, according to Lipper. The euro zone's momentum has been losing pace, according to Citigroup's economic surprise index for the currency bloc, which is crouched near a two-year low.
Japanese stock funds posted $638 million in withdrawals during the week, the most since July, Lipper said.
Both Japanese and European markets, which carry currency risks for U.S. investors, are down over the last month.
It was the second week of pressure for stock funds, which posted $9.6 billion in withdrawals the week prior, according to Lipper. Overall, the funds have attracted $55 billion this year.

802,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. US Stocks Post Strong End to Weak First Quarter 
US stocks rallied sharply Friday as tech stocks rebounded but that failed to avert a quarterly loss for the broader U.S. stock market as damage from the selloff on U.S-China trade war fears a week earlier weighed heavily.
Fading trade war fears, however, was not the panacea for investor jitters as the tech selloff – which was partly offset Friday – spooked investors, forcing them to unwind some of their bullish bets on the hottest sector in the market over the past year or so.
The tech rout came as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) tumbled – before pairing losses Friday – as the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal intensified after the Federal Trade Commission said Monday it takes ""very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”
The scandal weighed on both the shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) as traders speculated that both companies could become embroiled in the data breach scandal, increasing their vulnerability to regulatory action.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, ended the week at a more than one-month low after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump was mulling a change to the company’s tax treatment.
While the White House said there were “no announcements and no specific policies or actions” that were currently being pushed forward on Amazon, U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the e-commerce behemoth’s tax practices Friday.
""I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!"" Trump wrote in a tweet.
The S&P 500 rose 1.38% Friday but ended the quarter in negative.
2. WTI Crude Notches 7.5% Quarterly Win
Crude oil prices settled higher Thursday, ending the first quarter up 7.5% as losses in February were offset by strong gains in January and March as traders remained bullish through the quarter that OPEC cuts would keep supplies edging lower.
Yet, the uptick in U.S. production continued to gather pace as the most recent report from the Energy Information Administration revealed crude output rose to a record 10.43 million barrels a day.
During the quarter OPEC, the Energy Information Administration, and the International Energy Agency revised upward their production of non-OPEC output, led by the U.S. 
During the latter part of the month, however, investor focus shifted to the Iran Nuclear amid a visit from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who is widely believed to share Trump’s view that the Iran nuclear deal is fundamentally flawed.
On Thursday U.S. crude futures rose 0.87% to settle at $64.94 a barrel.
3. Dollar Bounce Failed to Materialise
The dollar suffered a poor end to the week and recorded yet another quarterly slump. The quarterly loss comes as the Federal Reserve raised rates during the quarter but failed to give the go ahead for a fourth rate hike, sticking to its December outlook of three rate hikes this year.
The Federal Reserve did, however, raise its estimates for economic growth and paved a path to steeper monetary policy tightening but this was played down by market participants citing the Fed’s timid inflation outlook.
Euro strength also weighed on the dollar during the quarter as market participants continued to bet that the European Central Bank was on track to adopt tighter monetary policy measures sooner rather than later.
Improving sentiment on Brexit, meanwhile, saw the pound rally sharply against the dollar in the first three weeks of the month, stifling the greenback’s attempt to mount a recovery.
The dollar fell 0.03% to 89.73 against a basket of currencies on Thursday.
4. Gold Ekes Gain Amid Dollar Weakness
Gold prices prices eked a quarterly gain largely driven by dollar weakness as rival currencies made strong gains, limiting upward momentum in the greenback.
Renewed safe-haven demand amid heightened U.S.-China tensions on trade tariffs, which have since eased, also helped the yellow metal offset the impact of a Federal Reserve rate hike.
While the Fed is poised to raise rates at least twice this year, traders continue to bet that the yellow metal will prevail despite a higher interest rate environment.
""Our commodities team believes that the dislocation between the gold prices and U.S. rates is here to say,"" Goldman Sachs analysts, led by Eugene King, said in a research note earlier this week.
5. The Bears Firmly Behind the Bitcoin Wheel
Bitcoin remained on track to end the month nursing heavy losses after selling pressure resumed this week as traders continued to abandon their bullish outlook on cryptos.
Investor uncertainty concerning a potential regulatory crackdown in the industry was highlighted by some as one of the main factors. Yet, others pointed to the lack of regulatory action on cryptos following the recent G20 meeting as evidence to contrary. 
Moves by tech behemoths Facebook, Google and Twitter to ban crypto-related advertising did little to help sentiment, however, at a time when demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies was sorely lacking.
At its peak in December, bitcoin had a market capitalisation of $327 billion, while the total market cap of the entire crypto space was well above $800 billion. After a tumultuous first quarter, however, the total cryptomarket cap is under $300 billion.
With little demand to support crypto prices, some of the large-cap cryptos have seen their gains achieved during the latter part of 2017 wiped out.
Bitcoin traded at $7,217.8, down from its peak of $19,891 on the Bitfinex exchange, while Ethereum traded at $390.09 well below its peak of $1,423.20. Ripple XRP, meanwhile, traded at $0.51613, after hitting a peak of $3.28 in January on the Poloniex exchange."
803,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:43PM ET</span>",EPA poised to announce rejection of Obama vehicle fuel efficiency rules,"By David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to use a Virginia car dealership on Tuesday as the setting to tout its rejection of the Obama administration's landmark vehicle fuel efficiency rules, a move that could put automakers in the middle of a battle between the Trump administration and California.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to sign a declaration by Sunday that the Obama administration’s vehicle efficiency rules for 2022 through 2025 are ""not appropriate"" and must be revised, Reuters reported last week. 
Pruitt is expected to speak at an event at a Chevrolet dealership in suburban Washington and will joined by groups representing dealers and automakers, according to people familiar with the plans.
The state of California, which has the power to effectively create its own fuel economy standards, several allied states and environmental groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight over the rules, aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.
California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered. Pruitt was in California earlier this week, but did not meet with Nichols.
Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing specific revisions to existing fuel economy standards and emissions limits remains in flux. EPA officials suggested a detailed proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said.
The EPA declined Thursday to comment on Pruitt's plans. An EPA spokeswoman said last week ""a final determination will be signed by April 1.""
Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011. But they have urged Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump to revise the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks. 
Overall, the Obama rules called for roughly doubling by 2025 to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States. But the Obama rules included a review by April 2018 as to whether the final years were feasible or not.
By declaring the Obama rules ""not appropriate,” the Trump administration can reopen the process of setting vehicle targets agreed to by automakers in 2011.
Pruitt is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but he is not expected to immediately propose new requirements, people familiar with the plans said. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media. 
The so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules sought to double the average fuel efficiency of automakers' fleets, or complete lineup of cars and light trucks, to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.
While automakers want relief from the Obama rules, they are pressing the administration to avoid a battle with California and maintain a single, nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements.
In New York, Toyota North America (T:7203) Chief Executive Jim Lentz said at an Reuters event on Thursday that automakers would face higher costs if they had to manage fuel economy by each individual state.
Lentz said individual state emissions requirements could result in Toyota getting ""towards the end of the year and I no longer can sell SUVs,"" depending on the state's fuel economy numbers. ""It would be an absolute nightmare for us to figure out.""

When fuel rules were written in 2011 amid high gas prices, fuel efficiency was the second highest attribute considered by Toyota buyers, Lentz said. Today it is 10th.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>","UAW added members in 2017, but union dues fell versus 2016","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers added new members for the ninth consecutive year in 2017 and the union remained in the black, but overall dues fell versus the previous year, according to the union's annual filing with the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday.
Membership in the Detroit-based union rose more than 3.5 percent to 430,871 in 2017 from 415,963 in 2016. But union dues dipped nearly 4 percent in 2017 to $175.8 million from $182.5 million in 2016.
In August 2014, the UAW raised the share of a union member's normal monthly pay that goes to dues for the first time since 1967.
UAW membership has crept up steadily since the end of the Great Recession, but it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. 
Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals.
The union and Detroit's automakers will negotiate a new four-year contract in 2019. 
The UAW remains one of the richest labor organizations in the United States and ended 2017 with net assets of $947 million, up from $862 million a year earlier.
The union's 2017 receipts totaled $273.6 million and its disbursements totaled $272.1 million.
Although the union added members last year, it also suffered a few notable defeats. 
In November, workers at the  Fuyao Glass  Industry Group Co Ltd (SS:600660) auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation.

And the union lost a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Explainer: Spotify listing could be roller coaster for retail investors,"By Chuck Mikolajczak and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA's unusual stock market debut on Tuesday levels the playing field for individual investors who are normally at a disadvantage in traditional listings, but could also make them more vulnerable to swings in the music streaming service's share price. 
The Swedish company is skipping a conventional initial public offering and listing shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with almost none of the safeguards provided by investment banks that would normally manage the process.
Spotify is foregoing the security of having bankers with a financial interest in its success, which will save it millions of dollars in fees to underwriters. The direct listing gives Spotify insiders a chance to sell their shares, but the company will not be selling any new stock to raise money. 
In a normal IPO, underwriters promote a company to institutional investors weeks in advance, using roadshows and meetings to gauge appetite for the stock. They use that information to ""build a book"" and settle on an IPO price, typically the evening before the shares start trading on the exchange.
WHO GETS FIRST DIBS?
Spotify's plan introduces an extra degree of uncertainty over how initial trading in its stock will unfold. And a slump in shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other technology-related stocks this week means investors may be less willing to bet on the listing.
The direct offering should give retail investors opportunities to buy in at the same price as hedge funds and other big investors who normally get first dibs on IPOs thanks to their relationships with underwriters. 
Spotify has warned in filings it expects the popularity of its service to attract outsized interest from individual investors, which could possibly fuel volatility and set an unsustainable trading price. 
""There will be people right from the beginning who say, 'I want to own this at any price,'"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""I think you'll see a see-saw action. We'll be looking for the dips.""
In a normal IPO, underwriters act as so-called stabilization agents that can step in and buy shares if trading is weak. 
AT WHAT PRICE?
Spotify shares traded between $95 and $127.50 in private transactions in February, according to its filing, giving the company a value of around $20 billion. 
RBC analyst Mark Mahoney kicked off analyst coverage of Spotify on Friday with an ""outperform"" rating and a share price target of $220. 
Robinhood, a smartphone stock trading app popular with young people, on Thursday started letting customers place orders to buy Spotify shares, but only through so-called limit orders where the buyer specifies a maximum price. 
Robinhood's clients have searched for Spotify about 14,000 times a day in recent weeks, according to a Robinhood spokesman. 
Fidelity's online brokerage plans to let clients enter orders for Spotify shares starting at 7:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, 2-1/2 hours before the stock market opens, a spokesman said.
Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, plans to buy shares of Spotify on Tuesday but is wary of volatility. 
""We'll buy 25 percent of what we want, and then set limit orders for the rest over the next few weeks,"" he said. 
WHO WILL MANAGE THE OFFERING?
Spotify has hired Citadel Securities as a market maker to set the opening price on the NYSE on Tuesday, with help from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), but their roles will be limited. Early on Tuesday, they will analyze investors' buy and sell orders and then set an opening price for the stock. 

Citadel will not have the benefit of a price set by underwriters the day before, as would happen in a normal initial stock offer.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","U.S. leveraged lending sags, high-grade rises in first quarter","By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK (LPC) - US syndicated lending in this year’s first three months was the lowest of any quarter since the one ending September 2016, after setting record issuance for all of 2017, with leveraged loans to highly indebted borrowers sagging while loans arranged for top quality companies climbed.
The US$517.6bn of loans arranged in the first quarter, down from US$604.4bn in the same quarter last year, was the least since US$440bn in the third quarter 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. 
Some of the bigger leveraged deals, including the US$13.5bn loan and bond financing backing Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s purchase of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk (F&R) unit – the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis – have yet to launch or be tallied in these volume figures. 
The F&R unit includes LPC.
Bankers are hopeful that this year’s newly lowered corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% will help free up companies for more acquisitions and related financing. 
The prospect of more US Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year and next will also keep borrowers refinancing existing debt before rates rise further, boosting loan volume, bankers said.
“Our current pipeline is probably four to five times busier than in mid-January,” said Brendan Dillon, global co-head of leveraged finance and capital markets at UBS. “This bodes well for a robust second quarter and likely third quarter.”
In the first quarter, US$269.3bn of leveraged loans were arranged in 718 deals, a drop of about 33% from the US$404.8bn in the same period last year from a fewer 618 issues.
Around two-thirds of the leveraged loans made in the first quarter were for refinancing purposes.
In 2017, when a late-year burst of mergers and the torrid pace of refinancing pumped US syndicated lending to an all-time high of US$2.5trn, the same two-third share of highly indebted borrowers repriced deals to lock in more favorable terms before rates increased.
Among highly rated companies, syndicated lending of US$197.8bn in the first quarter from 89 deals gained 38% from US$143.3bn in 88 deals a year earlier. 
“Tax reform has been a real shot in the arm for many companies in terms of lowering their costs of doing business, and making it more compelling to consider doing acquisitions,” one senior banker said.
Bankers are eager to put capital to use especially after the biggest committed loan financing ever -- a US$100bn bridge loan arranged by a dozen banks to back Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd’s US$117bn takeover of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc – fell away after US President Donald Trump earlier in March blocked the chipmaker deal over national security concerns.  
BUY, BUY
While leveraged loan volume slid, investor demand didn’t, allowing for borrowers to keep on pricing deals aggressively.
Investors kept clamoring for floating-rate assets, which are pegged to a rising Libor benchmark. That demand has dragged down yield spreads.
“The first quarter was all about one thing: loan spread compression – lower and tighter spreads,” said Michael Nechamkin, senior portfolio manager and co chief investment officer at Octagon.
Three-month Libor, at 2.31%, has jumped from about 1.70% at the year’s start and is the highest since the financial crisis. One-month Libor at 1.88% is up from 1.56%.
“Libor moved up so fast that despite the spread compression, the average coupon is still higher than three or six months ago,” Nechamkin said. 
While average leveraged loan spreads of 3.3% in the first quarter were the lowest since the third quarter of 2007, average yields jumped to 5.42% in the first quarter from 5.02% at the end of last year, LPC data show.
“For the last six months loans have outperformed high-yield bonds consistently month after month for the first time in well over 10 years,” said John Fraser, head of Investcorp Credit Management US. “Loans have also dramatically outperformed investment-grade bonds.”
Collateralized Loan Obligation funds, the biggest buyers of leveraged loans, could intensify their purchases, with more capital freed up now that they are exempt from “skin in the game” requirements to hold 5% of their funds’ risk.
Retail investors, meantime, have pumped in a net US$3.5bn into loan funds this year through March 21, while yanking out almost US$19bn from high-yield bond funds, according to Lipper.
“Loans do benefit from rising interest rates,” said Fraser. “Increases in Libor year to date have more than offset spread compression, so investors are realizing an improvement in yield and market prices have held up.”

807,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>","Trade bans, feed costs force furlough at Brazil chicken processor","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's third-largest chicken processor said on Thursday it would put 1,391 workers on paid leave at a plant in the southern state of Santa Catarina, in the latest fallout from European and Russian trade bans and rising corn costs.
The measure, which takes effect in June, makes privately-owned Cooperativa Central Aurora Alimentos the second big food processor in Brazil to trim staffing levels in less than a week.
Rival BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), the country's largest chicken processor, on Tuesday said it would give 30 days of paid leave to around 3,000 workers from May 7 at a Santa Catarina plant.
BRF announced the plans after the Brazilian government in mid-March temporarily halted production and certification of poultry exports from the scandal-hit food processor to the European Union. Executives at BRF, which faces claims it acted to evade food safety checks, were arrested in connection with an on-going food safety probe.
Aurora said Brazilian animal protein companies have faced hardship since August of last year. In June, Aurora will decide whether to send workers at another, unspecified unit, on paid leave, the cooperative said in a statement.
""A number of Brazil-based chicken processors have been banned from exporting to Europe beginning in the last two months of 2017,"" Aurora said. 
In December, Russia, citing growth drug ractopamine found in some shipments, also suspended imports of Brazilian beef and pork, which Aurora also produces. 
""The combination of these two factors caused excess supply and falling prices,"" said Aurora, 
The price of feed is also weighing on the industry, with speculators ""causing the artificial inflation of corn prices"" in Brazil, Aurora said, adding that the situation had forced companies to start importing corn.
Reuters reported earlier this month that JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), the country's second-largest chicken processor, ordered 30,000 tonnes of corn from Argentina to use for feed. JBS had last imported corn in March 2017 and may seek additional supplies from the United States.
During a conference call Thursday, JBS executives said Thursday the price of corn was expected to rise to 40 reais ($12) per bag from 30 reais per bag in January, putting pressure on profit margins.

Telia had bought a 1.4 percent stake in Spotify, the world's top-selling music streaming service, in June 2015 for around $115 million and sold them in several tranches over time.
Telia said the two companies had concluded their strategic partnership.
""Spotify has been a fantastic investment for Telia Company, both from a direct return and a partnership perspective,"" Telia Chief Executive Johan Dennelind said in a statement.
Shares of  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3 in an unusual direct listing that gives insiders the option to sell instantly and does without the support of traditional underwriters - a recipe for potentially high volatility in early trading.

The company was valued at around $20 billion based on private stock transactions among existing investors and employees in February, according to its filing.

(Reuters) - At least seven companies said on Thursday they were dropping advertisements from Laura Ingraham's Fox News show after the conservative pundit mocked a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre on Twitter and he responded with a call for a boycott.
Parkland student David Hogg, 17, tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on ""The Ingraham Angle"" and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads.
Hogg is a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale. He and other classmates have become the faces of a new youth-led movement calling for tighter restrictions on firearms.
Hogg took aim at Ingraham's advertisers after she taunted him on Twitter on Wednesday, accusing him of whining about being rejected by four colleges to which he had applied.
On Thursday, Ingraham tweeted an apology ""in the spirit of Holy Week,"" saying she was sorry for any hurt or upset she had caused Hogg or any of the ""brave victims"" of Parkland.
""For the record, I believe my show was the first to feature David ... immediately after that horrific shooting and even noted how 'poised' he was given the tragedy,"" Ingraham tweeted.
But her apology did not stop companies from departing.
Nutrish, the pet food line created by celebrity chef Rachael Ray, travel website TripAdvisor Inc (O:TRIP), online home furnishings seller  Wayfair Inc  (N:W), the world's largest packaged food company, Nestle SA (S:NESN), online streaming service Hulu, travel website  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE) and online personal shopping service  Stitch Fix  (O:SFIX) all said they were canceling their advertisements.
Wayfair said in a statement it supports dialogue and debate, but ""the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values.""
Replying to Hogg's boycott call, Nutrish tweeted: ""We are in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham's program."" 
Responding to public pressure, Nestle wrote on Twitter that it had ""no plans to buy ads on the show in future.""
Hulu said on Twitter: ""We'd like to confirm that we are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham's show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully."" 
CNBC cited a TripAdvisor spokesman as saying the company does not condone ""inappropriate comments"" by Ingraham that ""cross the line of decency."" 
TripAdvisor representatives did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Expedia, which was not on Hogg's list or another list of sponsors that Hogg retweeted, ""no longer advertises on this show,"" Expedia spokeswoman Maureen Thon said in an email. 
Hogg wrote on Twitter that an apology just to mollify advertisers was insufficient. He said he would accept it only if Ingraham denounced the way Fox News treated him and his friends.
""It's time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children,"" Hogg tweeted.

Ingraham's show runs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA).

820,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:08PM ET</span>","Eager for calming news, investors look to earnings","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nervous stock investors are hoping an unusually U.S. strong earnings season can restore some of the optimism that characterized equity markets last year.
Imploding technology stocks and fears of a trade war have pummeled the market in recent days. Given the surge in volatility this year, there is no guarantee that worst is over. 
Analysts predict strong results when reporting season starts up next month, with first-quarter S&P 500 profit growth on track to be the highest in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. That follows a blockbuster fourth-quarter period, and recent corporate tax cuts that boosted forecasts for all of 2018. 
A robust earnings period would bring back the focus on fundamentals and possibly put a floor under prices, supporting views that the 9-year-old bull market will go on, strategists said. 
""It's going to be earnings,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. ""The market has given up so much that earnings can start to redirect attention back into a market that has gotten much cheaper relative to where we were.""
With this year's sell-off and rising profit forecasts, stocks also are near the cheapest on a price-to-earnings basis that they have been since late 2016. The S&P 500 is trading at about 16.5 times forward earnings, well below the 18.9 level it was at in mid-December, according to Thomson Reuters data.
(To view a graphic on S&P PEs, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2E5ntYM)
Stocks' rout in early February, and more recent selling following worries over a U.S. trade war with China, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) privacy issues and a collapse in other tech leaders, have made investors skittish and more likely to discount the relatively strong economic backdrop that persists.
""We've been caught up in all of these things that could happen and may happen and that the sky is falling, but once earnings season kicks in, it's headline news and that steals away some of the negativity,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta.
To be sure, next week brings the monthly U.S. jobs report, a potential catalyst for further volatility. A strong payrolls report in early February had helped spark the stock sell-off that drove the S&P 500 more than 10-percent below its Jan. 26 record high - a ""correction."" 
The job report briefly drove up bond yields and touched off worries that the Federal Reserve may need to speed up interest rate hikes. The S&P 500 is now about 8 percent below its record.
Just in the first three months of this year, the S&P has jumped or fallen 1 percent on 23 trading days, three times the number of 1-percent moves it made in all of 2017. In 2016, there were 48 such days.
Market participants agree that U.S. stocks are unlikely to return to the unusually calm conditions seen last year, when the Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely-followed barometer of expected near-term ups and downs for the S&P 500, logged a record low daily average reading of 11. The VIX hit a two-and-a-half-year high above 50 in early February.
Expectations for U.S. earnings this year have jumped since December, when U.S. lawmakers approved sweeping changes to the tax law, including slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Growth in other major economies has also lifted profit forecasts for the large stocks that generate a lot of sales overseas.
Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The first-quarter S&P profit forecast is up 6.3 percentage points since Jan. 1, while the forecast for all of 2018 is up 7.7 points since then, based on Thomson Reuters data.
That suggests the bar might be relatively low for the first quarter. ""You still could see some relative upside there,"" said Keith Parker, U.S. equity strategist at UBS. 
Many companies already have announced plans for increased buybacks and dividends, or bringing cash back from overseas, and other ways to use their tax savings. More news on that front is expected this reporting period, which is set to start with reports from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and others April 13.

""If we get a discussion of repatriation - what companies are going to bring back ... that will have a positive effect on the market,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 04:37PM ET</span>",Ford CEO Jim Hackett earned $16.3 million as profit dropped,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett earned salary, bonus and stock awards of $16.3 million in 2017, while adjusted pretax profit for the automaker dropped $1.9 billion from 2016, the company said on Thursday.
Including pensions and perks, Hackett, who took the helm of the No. 2 U.S. automaker in May, made $16.7 million. 
His predecessor Mark Fields earned around $15 million in salary, bonus and stock awards in 2017, with a total compensation package of around $21 million. 
That brought total CEO compensation to about $37 million during a year in which the company earned a pretax profit $8.4 billion, down from $10.3 billion in 2016. 
Hackett was abruptly named as CEO in response to investors' growing unease about the U.S. automaker’s slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime automotive rivals and upstarts in Silicon Valley.
Hackett overhauled furniture maker  Steelcase Inc  (N:SCS), and then as University of Michigan athletic director turned around the storied but ailing Big 10 football program. He is the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry’s oldest institutions.
Earlier this month, Ford disclosed ambitious plans to shift the product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and reduce development and manufacturing costs. The moves are aimed at boosting profits and share price.
Ford and the rest of the U.S. auto industry face declining sales. New vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 after hitting an all-time high of 17.55 million units in 2016. 
Sales are expected to fall further in 2018 despite a strong economy due to rising interest rates. New vehicle sales also face a challenge from millions of cheaper, nearly-new off-lease models returning to dealer lots.
Ford also said Thursday that Executive Chairman Bill Ford, 59, received a salary, bonus and stock awards totaling $13 million in 2017, up 17 percent from 2016. His pension award fell about 14 percent to $1.2 million.
The automaker's shares closed up 2 percent at $11.08 on Thursday. Year to date, Ford's shares are down 10 percent.

Last month  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said CEO Sergio Marchionne received $11.9 million (9.7 million euros) in pay and benefits for 2017.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:23PM ET</span>",AT&T trial hears of consequences if Turner networks go dark,"(Reuters) - Twelve percent of subscribers would quit their cable or satellite companies if  Time Warner  Inc’s (N:TWX) Turner networks were no longer available, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology marketing professor said on Thursday.
John Hauser, who teaches marketing, was the fourth witness to be called by the U.S. Justice Department in its lawsuit to block telecommunications company AT&T’s (N:T) $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner. 
The U.S. government opposes the deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner's Turner networks.
Hauser's findings are important to the Department of Justice’s case because his data shows that AT&T, once it owns Time Warner, could hurt rivals to the point of perhaps costing them 12 percent of their subscribers by withholding Time Warner in the event of a price dispute.
But Greg Rigdon, executive vice president of content acquisition for Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), seemed skeptical of that figure when pressed to compare data on how many subscribers a company would expect to lose if they dropped a channel, called ""drop analyses,"" with real world data.
""I don't think I've seen a major drop-off for 12 months,"" he said, while noting that he had never experienced the loss of major content like Turner's family of channels.
Rigdon also noted that he did not expect AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner to affect Comcast. ""I don't have any reason to believe that it will impact my relations with Turner,"" he said.
In cross-examination of Hauser, Peter Barbur noted that Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish’s Sling TV, testified on Tuesday that 30,000, or 0.25 percent, of its subscribers dropped Dish when Turner programming went dark for about a month in 2014. 
Barbur, who represents Time Warner, also said that Cable One provided testimony that it lost less than 1 percent of subscribers when Turner’s networks went down for about a month in 2013.
""Instead of looking at real world data on blackouts, you were retained to do a survey,"" Barbur said. 
Hauser said that without knowing the entire scenario of those situations, it was hard to say why the results differed from his findings. ""I believe my numbers are accurate,"" he said. 

The trial, which is taking place in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to take six to eight weeks.

After years of expanding CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME).’s empire through deal-making, the CEO of the world’s largest derivatives market is at it again. In a major merger with Michael Spencer’s NEX Group Plc, Duffy has cemented his place at the very center of the global bond market.
The deal, which values London-based NEX at 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion), will combine CME’s dominant market for Treasury futures with NEX’s electronic BrokerTec platform, the largest market for trading cash Treasuries. The tie-up could cut costs for customers that trade both Treasuries and derivatives based on them.
“We’re complementary in nature,” Duffy, 59, said on Bloomberg TV.
Duffy’s story is oft-told, like a bedtime story for traders. A native of Chicago’s South Side, he broke out of a neighborhood where he’s said everyone was either a fireman or a cop, knowing he wanted to do something different.
In the 1980s, Duffy was tending bar and going to school at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, when he met a trader called Vincent Schreiber. In Duffy, Schreiber saw a go-getter, and suggested he try his hand at what was then called the Chicago Merc. Duffy’s mother and father mortgaged their house to stake him.
Guaranteed Losses
Duffy lost all the money, some $100,000. But he traded his way back, and then some. When he told Schreiber he was done trading, his friend told him he was crazy. He guaranteed Duffy’s losses and told him to keep trading, advice he took to heart.
“I started as a runner on the exchange, and I was tending bar, and met a gentleman who thought I would be good in the business,” Duffy said. “I was making $56 a week. And I never left.”
Since taking the helm at CME in 2002, Duffy has aggressively built the business through big mergers. He bought the New York Mercantile Exchange for almost $10 billion in 2008, two years after taking over the Chicago Board of Trade for another $9.5 billion. The NEX acquisition has the potential to seal CME’s place in yet another trading domain, the electronic market for Treasuries. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year.
“The depth and resource the CME brings to the equation will allow the cash business to flourish even more than it has,” said Anthony Perrotta, former CEO of research firm Tabb Group LLC.
Big Personality
Combining with NEX will bring another big personality to CME, as Spencer, 62, will join CME’s board once the deal completes. A lover of French wine and rugby, Spencer has a fortune of about 1.03 billion pounds. He will act as an ambassador for the combined company in its dealings with clients, regulators and officials in Europe and Asia.
The expansion of the trading mammoth is not without risk, which any near-monopoly market can face.
“Man, that’s a lot of power the CME now has in the U.S. Treasury market,” said Jim Greco, who co-founded the former Treasuries trading platform Direct Match Holdings Inc. “You have to be a little worried about the pricing power of the CME in the most critical asset class in the world.”
Bond traders have reason to cheer the deal. NEX, also known by its old name ICAP (LON:NXGN), comes to the table with about 80 percent of trading volumes between dealers in the $14.7 trillion market for cash Treasuries. CME is the main destination for Treasury futures trading. Instead of coughing up margins to trade in two places as they do now, customers of cash Treasuries and futures could potentially save costs by having the complementary products under the roof of one combined powerhouse.
“In its essence the consolidation of some of these business and the centralization of them to a single clearer makes sense,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. “There is the economies of scale to be taken advantage of and collateral and posting type issues that will be easier to manage.”"

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) (MI:BMPS) will meet investors in London on April 4, two sources close to the bank told Reuters, as the Tuscan lender seeks to soothe concerns over its turnaround progress.
Monte dei Paschi is grappling with falling revenues and high bad loans that led to an 8.1 billion euro ($10 billion) bailout last year, with Rome injecting 3.9 billion euros into the country's fourth-largest bank and investors shouldering the rest.
Political uncertainty in Italy following an inconclusive general election adds to the nervousness surrounding Monte dei Paschi, which is 68 percent owned by the state.
The parties that currently seem most likely to form the next government - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League - have both expressed hostility to the bank's bailout and resistance to any forms of public support for Italian banks.
Monte dei Paschi may need to raise more money or be rescued by a healthier lender if regulators force it to cut its bad loan burden more quickly than currently anticipated in its restructuring plan, one of the sources said.
UBI Banca (MI:UBI) has been tipped in the Italian press as a possible white knight for Monte dei Paschi, but like other Italian banks it has repeatedly denied interest. 
One of the sources said the only option for Monte dei Paschi might be to engineer a three-way merger with two healthier domestic peers.
The world's oldest bank will not need to go through European stress tests this year but a banking source said it still needed to find a near-term solution to shore up its finances.
Monte dei Paschi would not be able to rely on the Treasury and the Bank of Italy to trigger a three-way merger as their ability to exercise pressure on other Italian lenders is limited, he said. 
The Treasury is in wait-and-see mode in the absence of a government while the Bank of Italy, which has come under fire for its handling of the Italian banking crisis, has lost its ""persuasion power,"" he added.
Last week, the bank issued a statement to quell speculation it may need fresh capital and said its turnaround plan was on track.
REASSURANCE NEEDED
One of the sources and one shareholder in the bank said Monte dei Paschi's CEO Marco Morelli is seeking to reassure investors concerned with the decline of the share price and slow progress on the restructuring plan agreed with the EU Commission.
The bank's newly-appointed chief financial officer, Andrea Rovellini, will also join the investor meetings, which have been organized by  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Shares in Monte dei Paschi have lost around 40 percent of their value since they resumed trading on the Milan bourse five months ago at a price of 4.1 euros.
""There is no reason to buy the stock: no signs of turnaround yet, possible further loan losses and the absence of a buyer which - by now this is clear - is needed,"" said Luca Fer, founder of BxItaly & BxWorld Hedge Funds which became a shareholder of the bank following a debt-to-equity conversion which was part of the bailout.
Monte dei Paschi posted a 2017 loss of 3.5 billion euros hit by 5.3 billion euros in writedowns of bad debts and falling revenues.
""They've got to communicate and they've got to have a credible plan,"" the shareholder said.
The bank will offload by mid-2018 24 billion euros in bad debts with the help of a state-sponsored, privately-financed banking rescue fund.
It plans another 2.6 billion euros in bad loan sales this year but even if it succeeds it would still hold 18 billion euros in soured debts, or around 15 percent of its total lending - three times the European average.
It aims to trim that ratio to 14 percent in 2019 at a time when the European Central Bank is pressing Italian lenders to cut their proportion of bad loans to below 10 percent of total loans.
The investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bank would have to raise one or two billion euros to cut the ratio to 10 percent.
""The market needs to be realistic because this is not an economy that is firing at full growth potential even if things are better than they were,"" he said. ""What makes it worse this time around is the political environment in Italy.""

837,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Shrinking junk bond issuance keeps U.S. high-yield prices afloat,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The junk bond rally may be over, but investors should not expect a sharp unraveling. 
Low supply in new high-yield bond offerings has kept prices afloat despite persistent investor outflows. High-yield bond funds have had net outflows in 10 of 13 weekly periods this year, totaling roughly $18 billion, according to Lipper data, as fears of rising interest rates have driven investors to other markets.
After a decade of declining yields and worsening covenants, outflows in the junk market have returned some power to buyers. 
""We're being more selective on the new issuance side,"" said William Smith, high yield credit portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein. ""We don’t feel the need to buy the regular high-yield issuers that haven’t really tightened covenants or are still trying to price deals aggressively. We think that being disciplined and picking your spots is the prudent way to invest in this market.""  
The spread over Treasury bonds - the premium investors demand to hold the risky debt - has widened and covenants improved slightly in February according to Moody's. But the primary response from issuers has been to reduce supply in an effort to wait out the junk bond fund outflows. 
""Opportunistic issuers are holding back because with rates on the rise, the bargaining power is not as lopsided in their favor as it was last year,"" said Martin Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors. 
Issues of new high-yield corporate debt in March are currently at $24 billion, half the issuance in the same month last year, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). New supply in the year to date is $68.3 billion, 25 percent below the same period last year. 
""In the year-to-date, high-yield is only down 1-2 percent compared to 3-4 percent in investment-grade. A lot of that is due to the reduced supply,"" said Michael Donoghue, president of Phoenix Investment Adviser. 
In the last Wednesday-Wednesday period recorded by Lipper, junk bond funds posted their largest withdrawals in over a month as investors pulled $1.2 billion on fears of rising interest rates, according to Lipper data. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent.
That would typically dent prices. But due to the reduced supply, prices on the two biggest indexes, the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETFand the SPDR  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital High Yield Bond ETF, fell just 0.09 percent and 0.05 percent, respectively, over the last period reported by Lipper. 
Junk bond prices have been falling on the whole this year, primarily because of interest rate hikes. Rising interest rates drive up yields on government bonds, decreasing the spread over Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has risen sharply year-to-date, up 13.3 percentage points, also boosted by a flight to safe-haven investments amid geopolitical volatility.
But as long as issuers are able to withhold new supply, prices are not expected to unravel dramatically in the near term.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box, an area that governs how it estimates revenue from long-term contracts. 
The 126-year-old, Boston-based industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that analysts say should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average. The company has indicated it may release the figures by the end of this month.
The increased disclosure stems from new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long-term contracts, known as contract assets.
Companies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for revenue estimates, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts, experts say.
GE's contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE's regulatory filings.
GE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is looking into GE's accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern. GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.
GE said in February that it expects to take a $4.2 billion accounting charge as it switches to the new standard. Some analysts think the charge could be higher, since competitors of GE's power business say the company is signing long-term service contracts at low prices to win equipment sales.
""That's what the competitors have been grousing,"" Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said on Wednesday. 
If the charge is close to what GE disclosed, it could bolster GE Chief Executive John Flannery's credibility, which has been dented by falling profit and a charge for old insurance policies revealed in January.
GE also is restating financial results for 2016 and 2017 so that 2018 results will be comparable. The company's financial situation has prompted talk that it might raise capital. Its shares rose on Tuesday after reports that billionaire investor Warren Buffett may buy a stake after selling last year.

GE declined to comment on the Buffett reports. It said it chose to restate prior earnings - a more exacting standard under the new rules - because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years on the same basis. ""We chose that approach because we believe that it is the most helpful to our investors,"" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

842,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>","Panda Bond Coming Soon From Quebec, Finance Minister Leitao Says","(Bloomberg) -- Quebec is working toward its first sale of debt denominated in China’s currency, with an issue likely months away, Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said.
Canada’s second biggest provincial issuer is leaning toward selling so-called panda bonds, which are denominated in yuan and sold in mainland China, to diversify its sources of funding, Leitao said Thursday. British Columbia, which counts a sizable population of Chinese origin, is the only Canadian province to have tapped the panda bond market so far.
A sale of panda bonds “will happen in the short term,” Leitao said in a telephone interview from Montreal. “I can’t say exactly how long it will take, but the regulatory and bureaucratic process is under way. It’s not a matter of years, it’s a matter of quarters.”
Montreal-based National Bank of Canada became the first North American bank to issue debt in China’s domestic market and has issued two bonds totaling 4.1 billion yuan ($650 million) since 2016.
Leitao met with Chinese bank officials and investors during a trip to Asia in January, and there is mutual interest in making a sale happen, he said. He declined to say whether the province has already picked banks for a panda bond issue.
‘Another Avenue’
Chinese authorities “are very interested in having issuers of our quality,” Leitao said. “British Columbia is already there, and they want even more issuers of this caliber. We are interested because we think the Chinese bond market will grow rapidly. It will give us another avenue for the next five, 10 or 15 years.”
Quebec plans to borrow C$13.4 billion ($10.4 billion) in the fiscal year that starts April 1, down from C$17.9 billion in 2017-18, Leitao said Tuesday as he introduced the province’s 2018-19 budget. In the four-year period ending in March 2023, annual borrowings will average C$18.7 billion.
About 40 percent of Quebec’s borrowings this fiscal year have occurred abroad -- twice the average of the past decade. Quebec typically issues bonds for C$500 million in Canada and relies on international markets for larger sizes.
To eliminate any currency risk, Quebec immediately swaps proceeds back into Canadian dollars whenever it issues debt on international markets. That strategy would also apply for panda bonds, Leitao said.
“We always swap the funds back into Canadian dollars, and the people from the Chinese central bank understand this very well,” he said. “There is no ambiguity.”"

850,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>",Why the U.K. Won't Punish Russia by Going After Its Debt Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- As the U.K. mulls further action against Russia in response to a nerve agent attack on a former spy on British soil, the question of whether policymakers should go after the bond market is back on the table.
Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure from some U.K. lawmakers to look into Russia’s sovereign debt. The issue is “extremely important” and officials are monitoring the matter very closely, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.
But like their U.S. colleagues before them, U.K. policymakers may find this isn’t a path they’re prepared, or able, to go down. Here’s why:
Britain Can’t Act Alone
One option would be to put pressure on the two big European clearing houses to restrict them from processing new Russian bond sales. But neither is incorporated in the U.K., so Theresa May would need approval from her European counterparts for an EU-wide ban.
“The U.K. cannot force Euroclear or Clearstream to refuse the clearing of Russian bonds,” said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. “It can try to impose EU sanctions on the Russian sovereign debt, which would have this effect, but I see this as unlikely at the moment.”
When, in 2016, Russia sold its first Eurobond since sanctions were imposed on individuals and industries over the Crimea crisis, Belgium-based Euroclear SA didn’t initially agree to handle it. Clearstream International SA hasn’t processed new Russian debt sales since 2013. The 2016 sale went ahead anyway and most foreign investors bought the bond when Euroclear accepted it two months later. Both clearing houses declined to comment on whether they would respond to pressure from the U.K. government over Russia.
Dependency Goes Both Ways
Imposing restrictions on Russian sovereign debt markets would push down prices of the country’s outstanding bonds. Since many of those assets are owned by international investors, including British pension funds, the U.K. would be shooting itself in the foot through its penalties. Investec Plc, Legal & General Group (LON:LGEN) Plc and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc are British money managers listed among the biggest holders of Russian Eurobonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Russia Can Survive Without Debt
In some respects, the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals in 2014 showed that Russia can always muddle through on its own. Those restrictions forced the country to cut down on borrowing (albeit at the expense of economic growth), giving it a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 14 percent, one of the lowest in the world. Thanks to higher oil prices, the Finance Ministry may add about $35 billion to its rainy-day fund this year.
If Russia’s sovereign debt is sanctioned, the Finance Ministry would simply reduce borrowing, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview with Russian TV Rain aired on Thursday.
The U.S. Already Decided It’s Not Worth It
The U.S. Treasury already looked into sanctioning Russian debt markets in response to alleged interference in the 2016 elections. Their conclusion: it would be too damaging for global markets. Their report on the subject published in February concluded that preventing American investors from buying Russian sovereign debt would hinder the competitiveness of asset managers.
“Because Russia’s economy has extensive real- and financial-sector linkages to global businesses and investors, the effects of the sanctions would not be limited to Russian authorities and business,” the report concluded.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:21PM ET</span>","FirstEnergy seeks emergency lifeline for U.S. nuclear, coal plants","By Scott DiSavino and Valerie Volcovici
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. power company FirstEnergy Corp (N:FE) urged the federal government on Thursday to evoke little-used emergency powers to help it keep several struggling nuclear and coal-fired power plants open, a move critics blasted as an attempt at a corporate bailout.
On Wednesday, Ohio-based FirstEnergy said it would shut several nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania in the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief.
FirstEnergy's FirstEnergy Solutions unit called on U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to use the emergency powers to order PJM Interconnection, the regional power grid operator, to negotiate a contract that would compensate owners of coal and nuclear plants for the benefits such as reliability and jobs those units provide. 
PJM, in response, rejected the need for an emergency order. ""Nothing we have seen suggests there is any kind of emergency from these units retiring,"" said Vincent Duane, senior vice president at PJM, calling the problem ""fundamentally a corporate issue.""
A spokesman for FirstEnergy Solutions declined to comment on Thursday about speculation the unit was headed for bankruptcy, but he directed attention to a filing the company made with the Energy Department earlier in the day. The filing included a comment made by FirstEnergy Corp's chief executive, Charles Jones, in February that he would be ""shocked"" if FirstEnergy Solutions did not file for some type of bankruptcy protection by the end of March.
Coal and nuclear power plant operators have struggled in recent years as low natural gas prices as a result of the shale boom have spurred utilities to retire dirtier coal plants. Last year, Perry proposed a plan that would subsidize coal and nuclear for providing what is known as base-load generation, which refers to units that run around the clock. 
U.S. regulators rejected that proposal in January and said they would conduct a study on grid resilience. Many grid operators, including PJM, have said they already factor in reliability of their systems and the fuel resources available to generate electricity.
Murray Energy Corp, which supplies coal to FirstEnergy and has been lobbying elected officials to keep coal and nuclear plants operating, said it fully supports the request for emergency relief.
""As a result of FERC’s failure, critical power plants will close, thousands of American jobs will be lost, and the reliability, resiliency, and security of our electric power grids will be forever compromised,"" Murray Energy said in a statement, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's rejection of Perry's resiliency proposal.
FirstEnergy said in November 2016 that it would exit the competitive generation business overseen by FirstEnergy Solutions as natural gas has taken up a greater part of the power load. 
On Wednesday, FirstEnergy Solutions said it told PJM it would retire all of its nuclear reactors in Ohio and Pennsylvania, totaling 4,048 megawatts (MW), in 2020 and 2021.
One megawatt is enough power for 1,000 U.S. homes.
FirstEnergy said it wants an emergency order because the power grid's reliability is threatened, due to the ""premature retirement of plants that have many years of useful life but cannot operate profitably under current market conditions.""
PJM said, however, that FirstEnergy's assets ""have been financially stressed for some time."" 
The Energy Department said it received FirstEnergy's request and will go through its standard review process. It did not comment further. PJM said such a request, if granted, would effectively circumvent FERC, putting it in ""uncharted waters."" 
Shares in FirstEnergy closed down 1.1 percent to $34.01 on Thursday.
The use of emergency orders related to power generation has been minimal, having been evoked only eight times since December 2000, according to the Energy Department, usually in response to natural disasters or blackouts.
Groups that rarely agree on anything condemned FirstEnergy's request.
The American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade group for the oil and natural gas industry, said, ""FirstEnergy's claim that the electric grid would be in immediate danger with these power plant retirements is simply untrue.
""PJM is responsible for the reliability of the grid and if there is an emergency, PJM already has the tools to respond,"" API said in a statement
The environmental group the Sierra Club said it would sue if Perry issues any order to bail out FirstEnergy.
""Ratepayers and regulators have already rejected multiple attempts by (FirstEnergy) to bail out these coal and nuclear plants that can no longer compete in the marketplace,"" Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, said in a statement.
Other companies have sought assistance from federal, state and regional officials to keep their coal and nuclear plants in service, and some states, including New York and Illinois, have offered subsidies to nuclear plants.
These companies argue that the diversification of fuel sources is necessary to keep the power grid operating in the most optimal way. More coal plants are expected to be decommissioned in coming years, and natural gas recently surpassed coal as the biggest source of power generation in the United States. 

Most states are also putting rules in place to boost generation through renewable sources.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Melrose  Industries (L:MRON) has narrowly clinched an 8 billion-pound ($11 billion) takeover of British engineer GKN (L:GKN), winning an acrimonious three-month battle for control of the FTSE 100 company.
The UK-based turnaround specialist said on Thursday that 52.4 percent of GKN's shareholders had accepted its hostile cash-and-shares offer by the time the deadline for a deal expired at 1200 GMT. 
That just surpassed the acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share that Melrose had set for the takeover of the aerospace and automotive parts supplier.
It means Melrose has triumphed with Britain's biggest hostile bid since Kraft pounced on confectionery giant Cadbury in 2009. 
GKN supplies parts to carmakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), components to aircraft including the Eurofighter Typhoon and produced Spitfires during the Second World War. 
Given its status as a mainstay of British engineering, Melrose's bid has attracted close scrutiny from politicians.
The turnaround specialist's motto is ""buy, improve, sell"", provoking fears among some lawmakers about the security of GKN's 6,000 British employees and the future of the engineer's pension schemes. 
It also raised concerns Melrose could in the future sell GKN's aerospace business, which is involved in defense programs, on to an overseas buyer in a move that might have implications for national security.
Seeking to quell such worries, Melrose made a series of legally binding commitments about GKN's future this week. They included pledges on research and development expenditure and a promise the combined firm would remain headquartered in Britain.
Business minister Greg Clark said on Thursday that Melrose is ""bound to honor"" those commitments.
""Now that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns,"" he added. 
""This assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course.""
Rebecca Long-Bailey, business spokeswoman for the main opposition Labour Party, said the government had ""acted too little, too late.""
""They have allowed a takeover to happen which may harm both our national security and industrial strategy,"" she said.
Meanwhile, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews takeovers for possible security concerns, is yet to give its verdict on the deal.
SHARES RISE
GKN, led by chief executive Anne Stevens, had put up a staunch defense against the unsolicited offer that included striking a separate deal to merge its autos division with U.S. firm Dana (N:DAN)
That tie-up was dependent on the failure of the Melrose takeover and Dana said its deal was now ""unlikely"" to proceed.
The trustees of GKN's pension schemes said they were looking forward to working with Melrose.
""We are delighted and grateful to have received support from GKN shareholders for our plan to create a UK industrial powerhouse with a market capitalization of over 10 billion pounds and a tremendous future,"" said Christopher Miller, Melrose's chairman. 
Melrose added that it urged hold-out GKN shareholders to accept its bid, which will now stay open. It expects to declare the offer unconditional by April 19.
Melrose shares closed up 3.4 percent at 231 pence, lifting the value of its offer for the engineer to about 471.4 pence per GKN share. That values GKN as a whole at about 8 billion pounds.
Shares in GKN finished up 9.5 percent at 463 pence.
Despite Melrose's victory, GKN said it still believed the bid ""fundamentally undervalues"" its business. 
However, given Melrose will take control of the engineer when the offer is declared unconditional, GKN said it now recommended its shareholders accept the bid. 
Melrose plans to delist the company if it secures acceptances from 75 percent, which would leave investors who have still not backed the offer with a stake in an unlisted business.
The statement from GKN did not include a comment from either Stevens or Chairman Mike Turner, who have both fiercely opposed Melrose since it first made an approach in early January and quickly became embroiled in a war of words with the bidder.
Meanwhile, the chief executive of Ohio-based Dana, James Kamsickas, said he was disappointed by the outcome. He added the U.S. firm still believed it was ""the best owner and operator"" of GKN's auto parts business.
It is possible that Dana could revive a deal for the division with Melrose in the future, a source close to GKN said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday revived a lawsuit by five Korean traders accusing the New York high-frequency trading firm Tower Research Capital LLC and its founder Mark Gorton of conducting illegal ""spoofing"" trades at their expense.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Tower's trades on the Korea Exchange (""KRX"") ""night market"" for futures contracts might qualify as ""domestic"" trades, entitling the traders to pursue class-action damages claims under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).
""Plaintiffs' allegations make it plausible that parties trading on the KRX night market incur irrevocable liability in the United States,"" Circuit Judge John Walker wrote.
The 3-0 decision also restored the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims. It overturned a February 2017 ruling by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, and returned the case to her.
A lawyer for Tower and Gorton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""We are looking forward to prosecuting this case,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer Michael Eisenkraft said in an interview.
High-frequency traders were the subject of Michael Lewis' 2014 best-seller ""Flash Boys.""
Critics say their algorithms give them unfair split-second trading advantages over ordinary investors.
The KRX night market operates when the Busan, South Korea-based exchange is closed. Orders entered in Korea are matched with counterparties by a CME Globex electronic trading platform in Aurora, Illinois. Trades settle the next morning.
According to the complaint, Tower rigged prices of KOSPI 200 futures contracts in 2012, when it made 53.8 percent of all such trades on the night market, by placing and quickly canceling trades or ensuring it was its own counterparty.
The plaintiffs, who traded those contracts, said this created artificial supply and demand, enabling Tower, which was founded in 1998, to sell contracts at inflated prices or buy them at deflated prices.
Citing a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision restricting U.S. securities claims based on non-U.S. conduct, Tower said the Korean traders' lawsuit was properly dismissed because night market trades were settled in their country.
Walker, however, said the Supreme Court said nothing about the CEA, and Tower might have become liable when the trades were ""matched,"" in Illinois.
""If plaintiffs bought higher or sold lower than they would have absent defendants' manipulation, defendants would have caused plaintiffs harm and enriched themselves at plaintiffs' expense,"" Walker wrote.
""In our view, the connection between the parties in that situation would not be too attenuated,"" he added.
The case is Choi et al v Tower Research Capital LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-648.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies have been swept up in a global boom in dealmaking that has seen the amount of M&A involving UK firms hit its highest level since 2007.
Britain's M&A market has remained buoyant despite the country's looming exit from the European Union a year from now, a prospect which has cast uncertainty over British companies' access to the single market.
Rather than deter businesses from striking deals, however, it has prompted them to prepare for Brexit by acquiring rivals to build scale.
The availability of cheap debt, high equity valuations that are allowing companies to use their stock to pay for acquisitions, and economic growth are all behind the surge in M&A, bankers said.
The value of M&A volumes involving British businesses rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the most since the $166.3 billion recorded in the same period 11 years ago, Thomson Reuters data show. 
Including plans by Anglo-Dutch  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and RELX to abandon their dual listing structures, total deal levels hit $280.8 billion in the first three months of 2018 in the UK, according to the data.
It means that Britain remained the second biggest country for deals behind the United States. Globally, dealmaking surged 67 percent to almost $1.2 trillion, the data show. 
In Britain this week alone, U.S. exchange operator CME Group (O:CME) agreed to buy British financial technology firm NEX (L:NXGN) for about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) said it was considering an approach for FTSE 100 drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP), which has a market value of about 32 billion pounds. 
""This feels like it's going to be a big year for M&A,"" said Alison Harding-Jones, the head of European, Middle East and Africa M&A at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). ""This is not just UK based and is driven by a perfect storm of all the ingredients you need for deals.""
""BREXIT SQUEEZE""
British companies are bulking up in preparation for the post-Brexit era.
Dwayne Lysaght, the head of UK M&A at JP Morgan Cazenove, said there is ""a bit of a Brexit squeeze which is encouraging a focus on domestic consolidation."" 
""British companies are acknowledging the need to be bigger to compete in a more open, global market place,"" he added.
Domestic deals totaled $43.3 billion in value during the first quarter, up from $24.9 billion a year earlier, the Thomson Reuters data show. 
They include events and exhibitions business Informa's (L:INF) 3.9 billion-pound deal to acquire rival UBM (L:UBM) and the sale of  Standard Life  Aberdeen's (L:SLA) insurance business to Phoenix (L:PHNX) for 3.2 billion pounds.
The biggest is  Melrose  Industries (L:MRON) 8 billion-pound takeover of aerospace and automotive parts supplier GKN (L:GKN), which was Britain's largest hostile bid since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009. Melrose clinched the deal on Thursday after 52.4 percent of GKN investors accepted its cash-and-shares offer.
Stripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data. 
TOP OF THE MARKET?
The biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group was Comcast's (O:CMCSA) potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky (L:SKYB), an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) late in 2016. 
Both Fox's pending bid for Sky and Melrose's acquisition of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers.
The former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break up GKN, a mainstay of Britain's engineering sector, once it has turned the company around.
Indeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance toward M&A by foreign companies. 
In October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defense sectors.
Even so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A at law firm Allen & Overy.
""Yes, you could argue the government's being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,"" he said. ""But do I think it's right up there at the top of (acquirer's) agenda? I'm not sure it is.""
More worrying for the M&A bankers and lawyers would be if the current boom in deals proved to be the top of the cycle, as it was 11 years ago, and activity begins to falter.

""It feels very similar to 2007,"" said Morris. ""I would say if we're not at the top of the market, we must be pretty close to it.""

880,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>",Big Deutsche Bank investors seek clarity on CEO: sources,"By Tom Sims and Andreas Framke
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Large investors in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have urged its chairman to provide a clear signal on whether the board backs the lender's embattled chief executive or not, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Separate sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that Germany's flagship bank had begun looking for a new CEO to replace John Cryan to mollify investors frustrated by the slow turnaround of the loss-making lender.
Cryan said in a staff memo on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely committed"" to the lender. But Paul Achleitner, the board chairman who the sources said had initiated the search for a new CEO, has remained silent. 
Two major investors contacted by Reuters said they had called Achleitner to ask him to provide clarity.
Cryan's staff memo ""looks like an affirmation that he at least wants to remain in his seat"", said one source with knowledge of the thinking of one of the large investors. ""But where's the confirmation from the board? Why doesn't Achleitner say anything?""
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Cryan's memo urged staff to ""focus on executing"" the bank's strategy despite ""widespread rumours"".
The bank's strategy has come under criticism from some investors, who have grown impatient after three consecutive years of losses. 
The CEO search, which the sources said was in its early stages, has come after a flurry of negative headlines for the bank. During the past two weeks, the bank said its loss in 2017 was larger than initially reported, and it has also warned about conditions in the first quarter.
A second major investor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was frustrated that Achleitner had not provided investors with an update following the reports this week of the CEO search.
Achleitner must find a strong candidate who can solve the bank's problems in a sustainable way, the investor said. ""No hasty solutions. That is important.""
""Cryan can remain from our point of view, though this will probably not be so simple anymore,"" the person added. 
Cryan and top managers at the bank have repeatedly called on patience, saying a turnaround would take years, not quarters. 
The bank has raised capital and made progress with reforming its two retail banking divisions. Last week, it achieved a milestone in its turnaround by floating its asset management unit, DWS.

""We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards. There is no difference of opinion here,"" Cryan wrote to staff on Wednesday.

The stock has now lost nearly half of its market value since Facebook's comments on Wednesday that added to fears of increased scrutiny around how public data is handled and shared.
Facebook is under pressure to improve how it manages data after disclosing that information on about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
The social network has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom. Facebook's website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian PLC (L:EXPN), Oracle Data Cloud (N:ORCL),  TransUnion  (N:TRU) and WPP PLC (L:WPP).
Arkansas-based Acxiom, which earns over $800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world's largest companies, said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March.
However, for fiscal year 2019, Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be hurt by as much as $25 million.
""The immediate impact was small. Now the question is how far does Facebook react to its issues,"" First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin said.
""A lot of what (Acxiom) is doing is probably not wrong and probably not at the core of the problem that Facebook has. Targeting consumers using data is sometimes very clean and sometimes it isn't.""
Even with little raw data, third-party data providers like Acxiom attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals' finances, relationships, personal interests and purchasing tastes.
These profiles power targeted advertising across the internet, and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote.
""I welcome Facebook's announcement that it will be shutting down its partner category service, using third party data to inform targeted advertising,"" said Britain's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in a statement on Thursday.
WPP, Experian, TransUnion and Cisco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares of Acxiom were down 32 percent at $19 by midday. The stock touch its lowest in more than 2 years in early trading.
TransUnion fell nearly 1 percent, while WPP was down marginally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Executives from major automakers raised concerns at the New York auto show this week about the possibility of a trade war after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month, especially at a time when U.S. sales of new vehicles are in decline.
""Protectionism doesn't have winners,"" Hinrich Woebcken, Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) North American chief executive, told Reuters. ""When you start to raise bars, you are bringing an imbalance of trade that will not produce any winners.""
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports earlier this month that industry experts and manufacturers say could lower profits for companies making everything from pickup trucks to canned soup, or result in higher prices for consumers.
Trump has criticized Germany for levying tariffs on vehicles shipped from the United States, and threatened to impose higher tariffs on German-made vehicles. That has made executives nervous in an industry that is global. The Trump administration has also proposed tariffs on Chinese goods.
""Everybody who does a lot of business with China would be concerned about a trade war,"" said Johan de Nysschen, head of General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's luxury Cadillac division. ""A trade war would be harmful to that so we all hope that it does not happen."" China is critical to Cadillac's future growth strategy, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday.
U.S. auto industry sales fell 2 percent last year to 17.23 million vehicles after hitting a record high in 2016.
New vehicle sales are expected to drop further in 2018 despite a solid economy as interest rates rise.
Jack Hollis, Toyota Motor Corp's North American head of sales and marketing, said tariffs would mean higher prices.
""We'll all just have to raise prices ... because there's no way you can absorb"" all that extra cost, he said. 
John Bozzella, head of Global Automakers, which represents Toyota, Hyundai Motor Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd and others, said the trade group is pushing to convince policymakers the tariffs do not make sense as automakers export 2 million vehicles annually from the United States. 
Scott Keogh, head of U.S. operations for Volkswagen's Audi brand, said the U.S. car market is built on ""stability and confidence and we need to continue that."" 
""If you look at the number one correlation that drives luxury car sales, it's consumer confidence,"" he said.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Barclays $2 billion fraud fine resolves major U.S. legal issue,"By Lawrence White and Makini Brice
LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (L:BARC) will pay $2 billion to settle claims for billions of dollars of losses suffered by investors who bought toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007 financial crisis, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
The British bank denied misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing the instruments and allegations it committed mail fraud and bank fraud.
The settlement, described by Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley as ""fair and proportionate"", resolves the bank's largest outstanding legal issue in the United States, and could reassure investors who had been braced for a potentially larger fine.
""The settlement is at the bottom end of expectations and has come sooner than expected, so this is a good outcome for Barclays,"" Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec Bank in London, said.
""It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible,"" Staley said.
Barclays shares were up 1 percent by 1445 GMT following the announcement. The bank said paying the fine would hit its core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, by 0.45 percentage points. 
Two former Barclays executives, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, who worked on the RMBS deals paid a combined $2 million in exchange for claims against them being dismissed, the Justice Department said.
""Solely to put this matter behind him, Mr. Menefee has agreed to a settlement in which he has not admitted any wrongdoing,” lawyers representing Menefee said.
A lawyer representing Carroll said that his client denied any wrongdoing and had settled to put the case behind him.
Barclays, unlike rival banks facing similar claims by the Justice Department, was sued in December 2016 after resisting a penalty proposed in initial settlement negotiations.
The Barclays settlement is one of the lower payouts made by banks facing such claims, with  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) agreeing in December 2016 to pay out a combined $5.3 billion in settlements and consumer relief, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) settled for $7.2 billion in January last year. 
The actions against the banks over mortgage securities stem from a 2012 initiative by U.S. President Barack Obama to pursue the misconduct that helped lead to the financial crisis.

Barclays' settlement could encourage its rival Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), which has been frustrated by a lack of progress in settling its own case that is blocking the bank from resuming dividend payments.

889,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",FAANG stocks are a 'dead trade',"The stock market is seeing a ""reallocation"" out of FAANG stocks, which are not where the smart money is, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Robo Global Bill Studebaker told Business Insider. 
The FAANG stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Amazon,  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) are all down considerably since March 12, a trend that accelerated when news of a  massive Facebook data scandal broke, sending the  tech-heavy Nasdaq into a downward frenzy. 
Investors are wondering what's next. 
And what's next isn't good news for FAANG stock optimists, Studebaker thinks. ""This is a dead trade"" for the next several months, he said. ""I wouldn't expect there to be a lot of performance attribution coming from the FAANG stocks,"" he added. That is, if the stock market is to see gains in the next several months, they will largely not come from the big tech companies.
The market is seeing a ""reallocation out of large-cap technology, into other parts of the market,"" he said. And this trend could continue for the foreseeable future. ""When you get these reallocation trades, a de-risking, this can go on for months and months."" The FAANG's are pricey stocks, he said, pointing out that investors will ""factor in the law of big numbers,"" he said. ""Just because they're big cap doesn't mean they're safe,"" he added. 
Still, he doesn't necessarily think that investors are going to shift drastically into value stocks. ""With an increasingly favorable macro backdrop, you have strong growth demand.""
Studebaker, who runs an artificial intelligence and robotics exchange-traded fund with $2.3 billion in assets under management, thinks that AI and robotics are better areas of growth. His ETF is up 27% in the past year, while the FAANG stocks are also largely up over that same span, even if they are down since March 12. 
While many point to artificial intelligence as an area that will be a boost to Google and Amazon, Studebaker doesn't see that as a sign of significant growth for the FAANGs. He pointed out that ""eighty to ninety percent of their businesses are still search,"" and that ""AI doesn't really move the needle on the business."" He also said ""the revenue mix [attributable to AI] in those businesses are insignificant.""
And while he's not bullish on FAANG's, he does say that the one FAANG to still watch out for is Amazon, simply because ecommerce still represents a small portion of the global retail market, giving the company room to grow. "
890,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>","Reason will prevail in Brexit negotiations, Next boss says","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will likely win a Brexit deal that suits both sides of her warring party and the EU because the alternative does not bear thinking about, the boss of one of Britain's biggest retailers and a prominent Leave supporter said.
Exactly one year before Britain's formal withdrawal from the EU on March 29, 2019, Next Chief Executive Simon Wolfson said the prospect of achieving consensus within the Conservative Party and between the EU and the British government was growing.
Wolfson has been CEO of clothing retailer Next for 17 years and as a Conservative peer sits in the upper house of Britain's parliament, giving him an insight into the workings of the government and the impact its policies have on consumers.
""The alternative to a deal you don't like is a situation that's much worse, and that is ultimately likely to keep everyone in check,"" Wolfson told Reuters in an interview at Next's London office.
""If you take an extreme Remain view and say: 'I’m just going to wreck the deal', the alternative is we drop out with no deal at all. Even the most die hard Remainer would prefer to have some form of agreement with the EU.
""Equally if you're a die hard Leaver and say: 'I'm not going to accept anything less than 100 percent independence with 100 percent access to all of the benefits of the EU,' the alternative is the government saying: 'I'm going to ignore you because that's not possible.'""
""Ultimately we have to have a degree of faith in the process of rational debate.""
Last week, EU leaders approved a 21-month transition period to help business adapt after Brexit, kicking off possibly the hardest part of the negotiation to agree the bloc's future trading relationship with Britain.
However, until a transition deal is legally ratified, probably later this year, many companies are having to plan for the worst and assume that the UK will crash out of the EU in March 2019.
SENSIBLE
Wolfson said the transition period was sensible, particularly as there was ""absolutely no way"" the detail of Brexit could be agreed by March 2019.
""The idea of agreeing Heads of Terms (a broad outline of the deal) before going into detail makes complete sense, because in many ways the principles are the hard things to agree to politically and the details are the hard things to agree to practically,"" he said.
Next trades from over 500 stores in the UK and Ireland and around 200 stores overseas. It imports 15-20 percent of the products it sells from the EU, with the rest from Asia. It sells into 70 countries and employs 45,000 in Britain.
Wolfson, lauded by analysts for his reading of the economic runes, said his ideal scenario was that by end-March 2019 there was UK-EU agreement on no tariffs on goods, an agreement for expedited customs and expedited movement of people, and a recognition that there will be some form of borders.
""Already you can see that on goods there is pretty much broad agreement that there shouldn't be tariffs,"" he said.
Wolfson, whose great grandfather settled in Glasgow in the late 1890s after fleeing the persecution of Jews on the Polish/Lithuanian border, said that while he recognized the value of immigration there needed to be some controls.
""People think that Brexit was somehow the result of populism, actually in UK politics Brexit has been the antidote to populism and extremism – Brexit has wiped out UKIP,"" he said, in reference to the pro-Brexit party. 
""All that horrible talk about immigration has pretty much disappeared.""
JURY'S OUT ON MAY
Wolfson also stressed the Brexit deal is not going to be the make or break of Britain's economy.
""It's important but it's not the sum total of things that will make a difference to the British economy over the next 20 years.
""Things like our approach to planning, infrastructure, transport, the free market and regulation will make as much, if not more, difference,"" he said.
Wolfson said May had done a good job as a consensus builder, conciliator and honest broker with Europe. But he is not convinced she can go on as leader beyond Brexit.

""I'm not saying that she's not capable of leading us into the next election, but the jury's out.""

892,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>","Investors back on the defensive, but where to hide?","By Helen Reid and Tom Pfeiffer 
LONDON (Reuters) - Equity investors looking for protection from tech-led share reversals, trade wars and Europe's slowing economic momentum may find that the ""defensive"" sectors they usually seek out during market storms are no longer the safe havens they once were. 
Earnings of telecom, consumer staples and healthcare companies and utilities tend to hold up when macro indicators turn south, but many of these now face disruptive or competitive forces that threaten their traditionally robust income streams. 
""'Defensive value' stocks have become a very small niche this cycle. Those that appear defensive and not aggressively priced typically have some structural or regulatory issues,"" said Paul Harper, equity strategist at DNB in Oslo. 
Big European telecom firms for instance are struggling to get hoped-for returns from their investments in broadband and mobile infrastructure as smaller rivals nip at their heels with simple, cheap data plans. 
And competition rules and the lack of a unified European telecom market are making defensive mergers hard to pull off. 
Utilities face similar challenges and are also grappling with weak wholesale energy prices, an increasingly redundant model of centralized power generation and the cost of building new networks to manage a rapid switch to renewables. 
Tobacco companies are pushing new technologies but they are at a relatively early stage, the results are patchy and it is unclear whether they can offset the gradual decline in revenue as more smokers kick the cigarette habit. 
And the food industry is going through unprecedented upheaval as big brands face competition from retailers' own labels and activist investors push for swingeing cost cuts, making it harder for companies like  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Nestle to defend their profit margins. 
In healthcare, drug distribution and health insurance face the threat of disruption by e-commerce giants, forcing prices lower even as pressure grows on state health budgets. 
""A number of politicians have talked about tighter regulations on pricing of pharmaceutical products which is a risk for defensive healthcare stocks,"" said Harper. ""In the UK, a change of government could potentially hit some utilities with nationalisation.""  
WARNING SIGN
The recent rise of tech stocks to rule global markets, and the dominance of banks in the rally starting after U.S. President Trump was elected in November 2016, have combined to create a highly cyclically-led market. 
""Defensive"" sectors look cheaper on some measures than cyclical stocks after rising less during the breakneck equities rally. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Thursday that European cyclicals were now trading at a rare premium to defensives on price-to-book. 
This historically was a reliable warning signal for cyclicals' price and earnings per share performance over the following 12 to 24 months, MS said.
Investors' positioning on cyclicals has also begun to look elevated.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) found both European and global funds have increased their cyclicals exposure to near the highest levels in the last decade.
Among the best-performing STOXX 600 sectors over the past five sessions are utilities (SX6P) and consumer staples <.SCOST>, which rose while banks, tech stocks and industrials fell. 
Those now looking at defensives are being very selective. Chris Dyer, global investment director at Eaton Vance, said investors should look for high quality companies with strong pricing power, including powerful consumer brands and franchises. 
""You look at the derating of the defensive sectors and see some good opportunities,"" he said. 
Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM in Italy, is adding to positions in Italian utilities,  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) and Nestle (S:NESN). He also holds German utilities E.ON (DE:EONGn) and RWE (DE:RWEG). 
Even tobacco stocks look attractive to some. Saracen Global Income and Growth Fund has bought back into Imperial Brands (L:IMB), a stock that has tumbled 24 percent this year, saying it was generating strong enough cash to maintain its dividends. 
OTHER DEFENSIVE OPTIONS
Some investors, reluctant to bet on defensives, are looking for protection elsewhere. 
""We haven’t made any specific changes, but our portfolio managers have been holding some portfolio insurance in case of a setback,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild. 
The insurance is a mix of put options and third-party funds that either trade volatility themselves, or can deliver uncorrelated returns, he added. "" (It) means we have been spared the difficulties of having to choose specific “defensive” sectors – it wouldn’t be easy!”
This reluctance to opt for specific defensive sectors and risk choosing the ""wrong"" one has also inspired some to look to exchange traded funds. 

""The interest in more defensive, high quality, low volatility (factor ETFs), has increased,"" said Michael Hunstad, head of the quantitative strategies group at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management. ""Investors don't want to just buy a Utilities ETF, they want something more diversified.""

893,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>","Trump escalates attack on Amazon, focusing on tax, shipping","By Lisa Lambert and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he offered no evidence to back up his criticisms and did not suggest any actions he would take.
Trump has attacked Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos several times, and his latest comment came a day after news website Axios reported he was obsessed with the world's largest online retailer and wanted to rein in its growing power, possibly with federal antitrust or competition laws.
""I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!"" Trump tweeted early on Thursday.
Amazon shares fell as much as 4.5 percent in morning trade, but recovered and closed up just over 1 percent. The stock dropped 5 percent on Wednesday following the Axios report. Amazon declined to comment on the tweet. 
The retailer and cloud computing pioneer is the latest company Trump has singled out for praise or condemnation, although the effect on stock prices of his targets is generally short-lived.
Trump's criticism did not diminish U.S. fund managers' long-term enthusiasm for Amazon, whose stock has risen more than five-fold in the last five years. 
""If there really was teeth or real concern that something would come out of the government and regulatory oversight, Amazon’s stock drop would be a lot lower than it is today,"" said Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager at Monetta Financial Services in Wheaton, Illinois, which holds Amazon shares.
TAX BREAKS 
Trump's attacks on Amazon reflect a broader debate about its effect on the U.S. economy. It employs many of its 566,000 full and part-time staff in the United States and has allowed some small vendors to thrive on its service, but it has also been blamed by some for putting brick-and-mortar stores out of business as more people shop online. 
The Seattle-based company has promised to create 50,000 new jobs as it invests $5 billion in a second headquarters in North America. Amazon's choice of location for the new campus, winnowed to 20 candidates in January, has sparked fierce competition between state and local governments offering extensive tax breaks. 
Trump does not have any new policies planned that would affect Amazon, a White House official said on Thursday, adding that Trump was prompted to speak out on the subject in reaction to news reports this week. 
Amazon has been criticized for attempting to skirt state sales taxes, but since April last year it has voluntarily collected state sales tax on items it sells direct to customers in all 45 states that have one. Amazon does not have to collect taxes on third-party sellers using its Marketplace service.
That issue was the cause of some of Trump's ire, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Network. ""Amazon vendors that can run through the Amazon Marketplace ... don’t collect the sales tax. And that’s about half of their sales,"" he said.
Washington and Pennsylvania recently enacted laws requiring collection of third-party merchants' sales taxes, and other states are expected to follow. 
The issue is still being disputed at the federal level, with the U.S. Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments on April 17 in a case which could reverse a 1992 decision that only companies with a physical presence in a state are required to collect state sales tax.
Investors largely waved off concerns about that on Thursday. 
""If there is a law that regulates how you tax third-party sellers, it's going to apply to everyone and Amazon's position will remain the same,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
Amazon has carved out an influential position in Washington through lobbying, campaign contributions and pushing policy issues like job creation, but it could still face problems if Trump takes action against it.
""There’s a lot of things where the federal government can do real damage to any business, and that’s precisely why we don’t want the president to attack individual companies, certainly not for political reasons,"" said Stan Veuger, an expert on politics and finance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
POST DISPUTE 
It is not clear that Amazon is responsible for the United States Postal Service (USPS) losing money, although Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays USPS roughly half what it would to  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) or FedEx Corp (N:FDX) to deliver a package. 
Details of Amazon's payments to USPS are not publicly known. USPS declined to comment on Trump's tweet. 
An independent agency of the U.S. federal government, USPS reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for fiscal 2017, largely due to increased costs of retirement benefits. 
Deliveries for Amazon and other online retailers are the fastest-growing part of USPS' business, helping offset a sharp decline in regular first-class mail. Its revenue from shipping and packages in fiscal 2017 was $19.5 billion, up 13 percent from the previous year. 
""Common sense suggests USPS needs Amazon more than Amazon needs USPS,” Stifel analysts wrote in a research report this week. 
Amazon has undoubtedly contributed to the closure of many brick-and-mortar stores and the bankruptcy of some chains as more people shop online instead of in malls. But there are other factors, such as high debt, and Amazon is not solely responsible.
""Yes, Amazon has put thousands of retailers out of business,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. ""Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has also put thousands of retailers out of business. So has Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and any other superstore that took share from small businesses.""
Amazon founder Bezos also privately owns the Washington Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize last year for its investigation of Trump's donations to charities.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah denied on Thursday that Trump's criticism was a personal grudge. 

""A lot of people have made this, with respect to Amazon, about personalities and the CEO at Amazon - we're talking about Jeff Bezos here,"" he said on Thursday on the Fox News channel. ""It's really about policy.""

894,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>","In Italy, activist investors find a happy hunting ground","By Maria Pia Quaglia
MILAN (Reuters) - When U.S. activist investor Elliott Advisers laid siege to Italy's dominant phone company this month, a shiver went through the country's corporate sector.
Once a gentile club that resolved its problems in quiet, behind closed doors, corporate Italy is increasingly becoming prey for activist shareholders. 
North American and British investors, who favor more aggressive investment styles, have been steadily building their presence in Italy as its cosy network of cross-shareholdings has broken down following the global financial crisis.
Anglo-Saxon funds own 60 percent of the blue chip Italian stock market according to Borsa Italiana -- itself part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE).
The Italian exchange does not give historical comparisons but corporate governance experts say the influence of these funds has been climbing.
""The Italian market seems to have become ripe for activism, especially in the last three years,"" said Fabio Bianconi, director of corporate governance consultancy Morrow Sodali.
""Activists in Italy, for example, are pushing for business simplification with spin-offs and disposals.""
Elliott made its move into  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) early this month, declaring itself a new, minor shareholder and challenging the former phone monopoly's controlling shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), to launch a major shake-up. [nL8N1R51TP]
TIM has lost more than a third of its market value since Vivendi first took a stake in mid-2015. Elliott, founded by Wall Street hedge fund pioneer Paul Singer, wants TIM to partially sell its fixed-line network, possibly through a listing, and has called for Vivendi's directors on the TIM board to be replaced.
This week, a battle of activists broke out over Italian telecoms infrastructure firm Retelit (MI:LIT). German activist fund Shareholder Value Management lined up against a plan by other investors to depose Retelit's current chief executive as it supports the current business plan. [nI6N1QR01X]
CHANGING DYNAMICS
Activist investor Amber Capital, which looks for opportunities to improve corporate governance, has run 10 activist campaigns between 2015 and 2017 in Italy.
""The shareholder structure of Italian companies has become less concentrated: when the financial crisis started to hamper banks' lending, controlling shareholders were forced to place part of their stakes with institutional investors,"" said Arturo Albano, corporate governance specialist at Amber Capital.
The weight of institutional investors in Italian firms has more than doubled in the last 20 years, based on Bank of Italy and financial accounts data.
Their participation in shareholder meetings has also grown.
Until 2010, when a law clarifying voting rights came into force, shareholders were unclear of their voting rights in the event that their holdings had changed in the weeks leading up to a shareholder meeting. That often deterred them from voting.
The law introduced a 'record date', usually seven trading days before a meeting, which gave funds certainty over how many votes they could cast at the upcoming meeting.
""They are now in the position to back the proposals of other shareholders, including those of activist investors, if they create value for all stakeholders,"" Albano said.
PUTTING DOWN ROOTS
Shareholder activism still faces challenges in Italy.
Families control firms accounting for 33 percent of the Italian exchange's total market value and can wield powerful blocking stakes against activist investors.
Politics can also get in the way: the Italian government holds indirect stakes in some of the country's most important listed companies and it has a legal veto -- its so-called 'golden power' -- over changes of control in strategic firms.
Rome held a 30 percent stake in oil major Eni (MI:ENI) in 2009 when the firm resisted calls from U.S.-based hedge fund Knight Vinke to break itself up. It took three years before Eni sold its gas transport group Snam (MI:SRG) to state investor CDP.
Politics have not deterred Elliott, whose push for a shake-up at TIM touches on assets deemed by the government to be of national interest, such as its fixed-line network and its submarine cable business, Sparkle.
""Political risk is something activist funds are learning to deal with after Knight Vinke's mixed experience with Eni,"" said finance expert Hannes Wagner, of Milan's Bocconi University.
Today's activism is sprouting from roots that were put down a decade or more ago, as share registers opened up and activist investors gained more experience of working in Italy.
Last year, Wagner published a detailed analysis of 1,740 activist ""engagements"" with listed companies in 16 countries between 2000 and 2010, concluding that around 13 percent of Italian firms had had to deal with shareholder activism.

""Italy is second in the list after the U.S. because it has a decent absolute number of engagements but a relatively low number of publicly traded firms,"" said Wagner, who studied instances where activist funds engaged management teams.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Thursday as technology shares bounced back from a sharp selloff ahead of a long weekend that will mark the end of a turbulent quarter for Wall Street.
Shares of Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) were up between 1 percent and 4 percent, driving a 1.7 percent gain in the S&P technology index (SPLRCT).
Still, the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow (DJI) are on track to log their worst quarter in more than two years on concerns over a global trade war and aggressive interest rate hikes, as well as a rout in technology stocks caused by the Facebook data scandal.
""People are worried about rising interest rates. That has led to market volatility and we'll see more of that,"" said Mark Esposito, president of Esposito Securities LLC. 
Global investors have cut their equity exposure to a four-month low in March, according to a Reuters poll, while reducing their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.
At 12:35 p.m. ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 253.56 points, or 1.06 percent. The S&P 500 (SPX) was up 28.83 points, or 1.11 percent and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) rose 84.60 points, or 1.22 percent.
All eleven major S&P 500 sectors were positive. Trading volumes are expected to be light, ahead of the long Easter weekend.
Economic data released on Thursday did little to change the expectations of interest rate hikes. 
Core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge, rose 1.6 percent on an annualized basis through February, in line with economists' expectations.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January.
Amazon (O:AMZN) fell more than 1 percent after President Donald Trump blasted the company with a list of complaints, a day after news website Axios reported that Trump wants to rein in the company's growing power using federal antitrust laws.
GameStop (N:GME) shares dropped 9.3 percent after the company provided disappointing full-year sales forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,333 to 529. On the Nasdaq, 2,152 issues rose and 716 fell.

910,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 08:14AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Wall Street’s Beloved 'FAANG' Stocks Lose Their Bite,"Investing.com - The likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), who make up Wall Street’s so-called 'FAANG' stocks, suffered an unprecedented sell-off this week, as a string of negative headlines hit sentiment towards the sector that drove a long bull market.
After experiencing their worst one-day drop on record on Tuesday, several of the 'FAANG' stocks fell further on Wednesday, before enjoying a brief respite on Thursday.
The breakdown for the week looks something like this:
• Facebook is down 4% so far
• Amazon is on track to post a weekly loss of 4.3%
• Apple stock is down 1%
• Netflix is 5% lower for the week
• Google stock down 2.1%
Amazon fell after Axios reported that President Donald Trump was ""obsessed"" about regulating the e-commerce behemoth.
Apple declined after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts predicted lower iPhone sales in March and for the June quarter than the rest of the Street.
Google and Netflix slumped as a mix of regulatory scrutiny and a more defensive mindset from investors left them out of favor.
The tech sector has been on the back foot ever since reports emerged last week alleging that Cambridge Analytica, an analytics company, had gathered data from 50 million Facebook profiles without users' permission. Shares of the social media network have fallen almost 18% since March 16, when news of the scandal broke.
Besides the FAANG names, stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also saw intense selling this week.
Shares in electric carmaker Tesla tumbled after a fatal crash and fire of a Tesla vehicle prompted a U.S. federal investigation.
Meanwhile, Twitter sank after famed short-seller Citron Research called the stock ""most vulnerable"" to privacy regulations.
Another weak spot was Nvidia, which stumbled after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests on public roads following a fatality involving an Uber vehicle.

The boost in demand for Mexican beers is a result of a growing Hispanic population, a demography the company has been focusing on to widen its consumer base. The strategy helped the company's sales beat estimates for the third straight year. 
The Hispanic population is the second-fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and accounted for 18 percent of the total population in 2016, according to Pew Research Centre.
Beer sales, which accounted for about 77 percent of the net sales in the quarter, rose nearly 12 percent to $997.2 million.
Net sales rose 8.5 percent to $1.77 billion in the quarter, beating the analysts' estimate of $1.75 billion that the maker of Robert Mondavi wines and SVEDKA vodka was expected to generate.
To cater to the rising demand, Constellation, which imports most of its beers from Mexico, said it would spend $900 million in 2019 to expand capacity of its breweries in Ciudad Oberon that lies south of the border.
Constellation shares rose 3 percent on Thursday after the company said it would pay its Class A and Class B shareholders a 42 percent hike in dividend. 
The stock is one of the top-performers compared with its peers over the past 12-months, rising nearly 40 percent.
The company is also on a drive to ""premiumize"" its portfolio and has added Craft beers such as Funky Buddha and Napa Valley winery Schrader Cellars, which sells wines for as much as $250 a bottle. 
Constellation on Thursday forecast fiscal 2019 comparable earnings per share to be between $9.40 and $9.70. The mid-point was marginally below the Street's estimate of $9.58.
However, analysts said the company's forecasts are often conservative and are updated through the year.
Net income attributable to the company more than doubled to $925.5 million, or $4.64 per Class A share, in the quarter ended Feb.28, helped by a $363 million gain due to changes in the U.S. tax law.
Excluding items, the Victor, New-York based company earned $1.90 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.74 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) Chief Executive Bob Dudley's remuneration rose to $13.4 million in 2017, when the oil and gas giant's profits more than doubled and production soared.
Dudley's salary was up 13 percent from 2016, when his pay package was cut by 40 percent after a majority of shareholders opposed the company's pay policy.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden saw his total remuneration in 2017 rise to 8.9 million euros ($11 million) from 8.6 million euros the previous year.
(Graphic: BP CEO Pay - https://reut.rs/2pO1ykw) 
""2017 was a year which saw delivery and growth across all our businesses. This was an impressive performance from Bob Dudley and his great team, now fully into their stride,"" BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a statement.
Dudley, 61, took the helm of BP in 2010, months after a deadly spill on the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has since paid more than $65 billion in clean-up costs, fines and lawsuits, some of which are still ongoing.
After selling oil and gas fields, refineries and other assets since the spill, 2017 marked one of the strongest years of growth in BP's history after it launched 7 new projects. 
It plans to start six additional fields this year, which will help it boost its production by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2021. BP's production rose 12 percent in 2017 to 2.47 million boed. 
(For a graphic on BP profits click http://reut.rs/2Ba1v97) 
BP's current pay policy, which applies until 2019, includes lowering Dudley's maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:35AM ET</span>","European funds buy bonds, see euro growth cycle peak: Reuters poll","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - European investors have raised their bond allocations in March while keeping their equity exposure at six-month lows, in a month marked by a sharp tech sector selloff and brewing trade tensions that threatened to dent world economic growth.
Reuters' monthly survey of 21 European asset managers showed average bond holdings rose 1.4 percentage points on the month to 42.1 percent, the highest since August 2017, while exposure to euro zone debt rose more than five percentage points to 59.1 percent, also a seven-month high.
U.S. debt allocations rose to 20.7 percent, the highest since last September, up from 18.2 percent in February.
The poll was conducted between March 15-28, a period when the FAANG group of U.S. technology firms - Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL) - saw a hefty reversal that took the S&P 500's tech index down more than 10 percent on the month (SPLRCT).
It also coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump announcing $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, alongside levies on steel and aluminum imports from several countries. 
The fears of tit-for-tat protectionist tariffs and trade wars burst on to markets just as softer purchasing manager surveys seemed to imply that economic growth, at least in the developed world, might be peaking.
That's especially so in the euro zone where economic sentiment has slipped for three straight months and Citi's economic surprise index <.CESIEUR> has tumbled into negative territory after a long period on positive ground.
Two-thirds of the fund managers who answered a question on the topic thought euro zone economic growth had already peaked in this cycle, though they saw a sharp deterioration as unlikely.
Accordingly, the share of euro zone stocks in equity portfolios slipped to 29.7 percent - the second-lowest level since November 2014, poll data showed. 
""Euro zone growth has most likely peaked,"" Colin Harte, head of research and portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management said, though he added: ""We do not expect it to fall sharply over the balance of 2018/early-2019, unless the world experiences a trade war.""
Most expected regional growth to stay above potential, noting ultra-low borrowing costs even if the European Central Bank ends its bond purchase program this year.
""A (growth) peak is not what matters. What will be key is the ability of not decelerating too quickly. In this regard, there are no signs that a strong deceleration is on the cards,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer of Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. 
Trade could be the unknown factor, however. Asked whether an all-out trade war would hurt the dollar or boost it, just over half of those who responded predicted a weakening in the greenback, while a third expected it to strengthen.
The dollar is ending March with its fifth straight quarter of losses against a basket of currencies (DXY). 
Widening U.S. budget deficits are undermining the dollar despite some support from higher interest rates, said Amundi's chief investment officer Pascal Blanque, who noted that trade tensions in 1982-84 and 2001 had caused dollar depreciation.
""A full-scale global trade war, with retaliation actions among trading partners, would undermine confidence, threaten the global recovery, and would push the dollar in the direction of further weakening,"" Blanque added.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates this month and is seen repeating that twice more this year, and possibly three times if the jobs picture continues to improve.
Fund managers who replied to a survey question on the subject were evenly divided as to whether rates would rise a total of three or four times in 2018.
Paolo Zanghieri, senior economist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, was in the latter camp, noting the robust labor market, even if the Fed's March projections showed three moves.

""It would take an upgrade of projections by just one FOMC member to tilt the median to four hikes, and we expect this to happen at the June meeting, on the back of stronger readings for inflation and real activity,"" he said.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>",U.S. funds recommend switching cash into bonds in March: Reuters poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers switched recommended global portfolios slightly more in favor of bonds in March, in part on concerns trade barriers between the world's two biggest economies may escalate to a broader trade war, a Reuters poll found.
While recommendations for stock holdings held steady, there were still near 4-1/2 year highs, on expectations for continued robust global economic growth and solid earnings.
But stock market losses this month helped the bond market a bit, pushing the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield down to a seven-week low on Wednesday, with U.S. government bonds set to earn their biggest monthly return since August.
While little else was changed in the way of allocations in the latest monthly poll of 12 U.S.-based asset managers taken March 16-29, there was a slight increase to bonds allocation at the expense of cash in the model global portfolio.
The average recommended exposure for stocks held steady at 57.8 percent, and global bonds was 35.4 percent, up from 34.9 percent the previous month, the highest since last April.
""Market confidence has taken a beating and it is not the import tariff itself that is driving sentiment but expectations that we are going to get more and more from this administration,"" said a fund manager at a large U.S. investment firm.
Beijing warned the U.S. on Thursday not to open Pandora's Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe after President Donald Trump slapped up to $60 billion in tariffs on some Chinese imports.
A separate poll of more than 100 economists this month showed Trump's trade tariffs would do more harm than good to the economy but they remained optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path. 
Concerns of a broader trade war have driven demand for longer-dated Treasuries but the short end sell-off has been motivated by strengthening views for faster rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Indeed, the Treasury yield curve has flattened in recent months and that trend is forecast to continue over the coming year, according to a separate Reuters poll of fixed-income strategists. 
""The economic fundamentals and profits estimates are positive for stocks, and despite the recent volatility, equities remain in an uptrend,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.

""The recent concern and market volatility seems to revolve around policy actions, specifically higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and trade initiatives/restrictions from the Trump administration. These policy actions represent the greatest risk to the markets, in our view.""

924,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>","UK remain cautious on equities, favour emerging markets: Reuters poll","By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - British investors rattled by global trade tensions are holding equity exposure near four-month lows, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, though they see emerging market assets as benefiting from dollar weakness.
Reuters' latest monthly asset allocation poll of 15 UK-based investment managers was conducted between March 15-27, when U.S. President Donald Trump's moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and on some imports from China, sent world stocks (MIWO00000PUS) to six-week lows. 
Investors are worried about tit-for-tat retaliatory measures from China and a deterioration in world trade that will crimp economic global.
""Nobody tends to win in a full blown trade war,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum.
The poll showed managers kept equity exposure steady at 51.3 percent and raised cash levels to 5.9 percent, the highest since July 2017.
They also sought diversification by raising their exposure to alternatives such as hedge funds and commodities to 15 percent of their global balanced portfolios, the highest in at least five years.
Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), said equities had taken a battering since the ""melt-up"" at the turn of the year, but it was normal for markets to remain edgy for a month or two after such a sharp reversal.
He has been adding to equity holdings, and sees the best opportunities in growth-sensitive emerging markets and Japan. 
UK funds' exposure to emerging stocks was steady at around 22.4 percent, while Japanese equities rose to 11 percent of global equity portfolios, the highest since August 2016.
""Although growth is set to slow in China after a strong 2017, emerging economies should benefit from strong global demand and some dollar weakness,"" said Mouhammed Choukeir, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros.
MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index (MSCIEF) is set to end March down around 2.4 percent, compared with a loss of 3.3 percent for world stocks. 
Investors also raised their emerging market bonds allocation by 1.5 percentage points to 24.4 percent of their global bond portfolios.
DOLLAR OUTLOOK 
Poll participants who answered a question on the outlook for the U.S. dollar were divided as to whether it would strengthen or weaken in the event of a major trade war, with 50 percent opting for weaken, while a third were undecided. 
The dollar (DXY) hit a five-week low against a basket of six other major currencies in March. 
Michael Ingram, chief market strategist at WHIreland Wealth Management, was one of those who plumped for weaken. 
""Although the U.S. is a relatively closed economy, to the extent that this global trade war is a consequence of a U.S. policy decision, it is likely that a further risk premium will be required to hold U.S. dollar assets,"" he said. 
Elsewhere, investors trimmed euro zone equity holdings by 1.2 percentage points to 16 percent, but some 88 percent of poll respondents who answered a special question did not think euro zone growth had peaked, despite lacklustre data.
""We think euro zone economic growth is rolling over from very high levels at the moment but this is unlikely to be the peak just yet as long as global growth remains strong,"" said RLAM's Greetham. 

""Moreover, monetary policy is still very loose and with inflationary pressure, especially wages, still muted, the ECB is unlikely to tighten policy aggressively,"" he added.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:48AM ET</span>",Global funds cut stock exposure to four-month low amid trade war fears,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Spooked by brewing trade tensions and a broad reversal in technology shares, global investors have cut their equity exposure to a four-month low this month while reducing their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.
Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 53 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out from March 12 to 27.
During this period, U.S. moves to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods, sent world stocks to six-week lows. 
Investors have been worried that tit-for-tat retaliatory measures from China and a deterioration in world trade could hinder economic global, prompting a sharp risk-off move in markets.
""Trade tariffs ... while they should not end up in a full-blown trade war, risk weighing on market sentiment just when liquidity is diminishing and financial conditions are expected to tighten,"" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi.
In the poll, investors cut their equity holdings by almost 1 percentage point to 48.1 percent of global balanced portfolios -- the lowest level since November -- while raising bond holdings by 2.3 percentage points to 39.3 percent.
Within equity portfolios, managers cut their U.S. exposure to 38 percent, the lowest since April 2016. 
U.S. stocks look set to end the month down 4 percent, hammered by trade war fears and worries about tighter regulation for the tech sector after a furore over the use of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) data by political consultants.
Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum, said it had been a testing time for equity investors, and articulated the threat to the U.S. economy and consumer of a trade war.
""U.S. companies operating in China would be affected whether it is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or a U.S. car manufacturer,"" he said, adding that Chinese exports to the United States improved the American standard of living through the provision of cheaper goods.
FALLOUT FEARS
A 62 percent majority of poll participants who answered a question on the outlook for the U.S. dollar in the event of a full scale trade war said that it would weaken. 
The dollar hit a five-week low against a basket of six other major currencies in March. 
Raphael Gallardo, a strategist at Natixis Asset Management, said that while first-round effects, such as a reduction in the U.S. trade deficit, might initially strengthen the dollar, ultimately it would weaken due to retaliation by U.S. trading partners.
""More importantly, the trade war triggered by tariffs would end up weakening further the prospective rate of return on investment in the U.S.,"" he said. 
The outlook for the dollar is complicated by the fact that the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates, targeting at least two more hikes for 2018 after a 25 basis points hike in March. 
A slim 56 percent majority of poll participants who answered a question on this topic expected three rate hikes this year, but a third opted for four, saying the Fed was behind the curve. 
Several noted it would take just one FOMC member to upgrade their expectations to tilt the Fed's median projection from three to four hikes for the year.
""The 2018 dot plot is more hawkish than the median three hikes imply,"" said Jan Bopp, an investment strategist at J Safra Sarasin. ""The 2018 call was a close one, and the move up in 2019 and beyond was clearly a reflection of the strengthening of the economic outlook."" 
GROWTH CATALYSTS
There was less consensus over the outlook for the euro zone economy, with just 51 percent of poll participants who answered a question on this saying growth had not yet peaked in the current cycle. 
""While inflation expectations have peaked short-term and German industrial activity has slowed, cheap financing will continue to be a driver as well as the robust global trade environment,"" said Jean Medecin, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac.  
Euro zone businesses rounded off the first quarter of 2018 with their slowest growth in over a year and economic sentiment data has underwhelmed. 
European equities look set to end the month down around 2.3 percent.
In the poll, investors cut their euro zone equity holdings slightly to 19.9 percent, but while some investors said growth might be slowing, with the stronger euro hampering export growth, it would not fall sharply.

""Growth catalysts like low real interest rates are still very much with us, so growth levels could remain above trend near term,"" said Peter van der Welle, a strategist at Robeco.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Concerns over Hyundai Motor Group overhaul rattle Mobis investors,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Worries that Hyundai Motor Group's planned restructuring will benefit the controlling family ahead of some shareholders have hit  Hyundai Mobis  Co Ltd (KS:012330), which is set to be the group's de facto holding firm, sending its shares sharply lower on Thursday. 
The parts supplier's shares fell 3 percent as investors fretted it may be forced to hand over a lucrative business to  Hyundai Glovis  (KS:086280), another group firm, too cheaply as part of the structural overhaul. At one point, it tumbled as low as 8 percent.
""From the perspective of the biggest shareholders, this is a satisfying deal...but for minority shareholders, there seems to be nothing for now,"" said Lee Hae-chang, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investment Trust Management.
Lee, who attended an investor conference held by executives of both Mobis and Glovis, was one of many participants questioning whether the deal will be beneficial to smaller Mobis investors.
Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's second-biggest family-owned conglomerate, said on Wednesday it planned to streamline its complex ownership structure in response to pressure from the government and investors. 
The chief of South Korea's antitrust agency, Kim Sang-jo, said the plan was a ""positive"" step towards improving the group's ownership structure.
Under the plan, which needs the approval of both companies' shareholders on May 29, Hyundai Mobis will spin off its domestic module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with Glovis, a logistics firm.
Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo and his son and vice chairman Chung Eui-sun plan to sell their shares in Glovis to buy stakes in Mobis. Affiliates Kia Motors (KS:000270), Glovis and  Hyundai Steel  (KS:004020) will sell their stakes in Mobis as part of the exchange. 
Hyundai Glovis shares closed up 4.9 percent, having earlier surged as much as 23.6 percent to their highest intraday level since Oct. 2015.
At least one fund manager said he would be opposing the deal.
""This is passing too big a piece to Glovis,"" the fund manager told Reuters ahead of the investor conference, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media.
Park In-woo, an analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo, said that while the valuation for the after-service parts business seemed a bit low, the mid-to-long term view for Mobis was positive. 
""After the spin-off and merger, Hyundai Mobis will be on the top of the group's ownership structure and will be able to expect effects such as boosted shareholder returns,"" Park added. 
In addition to resolving the group's cross-shareholdings in response to regulatory pressure, the restructuring plan also paves the way to building up capital for the junior Chung to ultimately gain control of the group, investors and analysts said. 
The domestic after-service parts business that will pass from Mobis to Glovis is a stable cash cow, and without it Mobis could find it hard to fund future tech development, said Lee Jae-il, an analyst from Eugene Investment & Securities. 

Other major group affiliates lost ground, with Hyundai Motor falling 5.3 percent and Kia Motors down 3.5 percent as investors were disappointed that these companies weren't included in the planned restructuring, Shinhan Investment Corp analyst Jung Yong-jin said.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Chinese developers flag higher sales to gain rank,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The publication of eye-catching sales targets by many Chinese developers this year has contributed to a sharp rise in their share prices as investors built in rosy expectations for the companies.
The targets by the developers with listings in Hong Kong are included in monthly sales updates required by the stock market regulator, and in other statements.
But analysts and fund managers say investors, especially retail investors, need to read the statements carefully because in many cases the developers are highlighting the sales expected from their operations plus joint ventures, referred to as headline sales.
Those figures can be more than double the sales that these firms can book in their financial results as attributable sales.
""Professional investors know they need to adjust accordingly,"" said Alvin Cheung, associate director of  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Brokerage Ltd in Hong Kong. ""But I'm not sure whether retail investors also know.""
The developers are not flouting any rules and analysts say that while share prices are rising, investors are not taking much notice.
""Once the market turns around, then the problem will surface,"" Cheung said.
 Country Garden  (HK:2007), China's biggest developer by headline sales, publishes a monthly sales figure that incorporates its joint ventures and associates. Greentown China (HK:3900) provides both headline and attributable figures.
Agile Group (HK:3383), changed the reporting on its monthly income statements last November from sales of ""the company and its subsidiaries"" to sales of ""the group, together with its joint ventures and associates"". It also provides attributable figures in footnotes.
A Reuters calculation based on 2017 sales data provided by real estate research firm CRIC, shows that headline sales are between 30 percent and 170 percent higher than attributable sales in 18 of the top 50 property companies by headline sales.
""Of course we use the bigger figure; everyone is fighting to be the top 10,"" said a Beijing-based developer, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic.
When Shanghai-based CIFI Holdings (HK:0884) first announced it was targeting a 35 percent rise in headline sales in 2018 to 140 billion yuan, its shares jumped to record high the next day.
In 2017, its attributable sales of 55 billion yuan were 55 percent of its headline sales.
Country Garden has declared headline sales of 550 billion yuan for 2017. Stripped down, the attributable sales would be 396 billion yuan, CRIC data shows.
When asked if the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was concerned that investors could be confused by the headline sales figures, a spokesman said ""under the Listing Rules issuers are obliged to release periodic financial statements prepared under applicable accounting standards. In addition to this, issuers' regulatory documents must be accurate and complete in all material respects and not misleading or deceptive"".
Country Garden said it would not consider including attributable figures in its sales statements ""because most of the companies in the industry do not report attributable figures"".
CIFI, Agile and Greentown China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""It is part of the game that companies present the data in a way that's most positive to them, that's why investors cannot blindly take in what companies tell them and have to do their own homework,"" said Victor Yeung, chief investment officer of Hong Kong based Admiral Investment, which mainly invests in real estate investment trusts.
Investors and credit ratings agencies also face a difficult task in calculating how much debt property developers hold. (http://reut.rs/2HmQXDe)

""It brings into question whether Chinese developers should follow the disclosure practice in more sophisticated capital markets; higher transparency helps to lower stock volatility,"" Yeung said.

In addition, the report cited a ""significant risk"" that the aircraft would not meet all tactical requirements by the time the German military retires its current fleet of aging C-160 Transall transport planes after 2021.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Activist investors say their voices are being heard by Japan Inc,"By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - Activist investors in Japan may be struggling to get companies to embrace their proposals but are optimistic that management is warming to shareholder activism that will likely shape more of Corporate Japan's decision making.
Activist investment has been gaining momentum since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe advocated strengthening corporate governance, and the peak season of annual general meetings in June could see more of such proactive shareholders attempt to influence management.
Japanese asset manager Sparx Asset Management's (T:8739) proposals to synthetic fiber maker Teikoku Sen-i (T:3302) were rejected at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, according to a preliminary announcement from the company. 
These included tripling dividend payouts from the current 30 yen ($0.28) per share and halving board members' terms. Details of the actual vote will only be available next week.
Nevertheless, Sparx does not think it is leaving the meeting empty-handed. Teikoku Sen-i did announce a small increase in dividend last month.
""I think our proposal did have an effect. They surely don't want to do exactly what we asked. But if we hadn't made the proposal, they probably would not have raised dividend,"" said Shuhei Abe, founder and chief executive officer of Sparx.
A Teikoku Sen-i spokesman said the dividend hike was to celebrate the company's 110th year anniversary in 2017 and to reward investors for their support, and declined to comment on the shareholder proposals. 
Abe also said active engagement helps improve shareholder value.
""Considering the globalisation of the market and Japan's market and economic situation, we firmly believe the tides have already turned toward shareholders actively raising issues and having constructive dialog with firms, and that this trend will continue to grow stronger,"" Abe said.
In another battle, Hong Kong-based hedge fund Oasis Management said on Tuesday its six proposals to Japanese internet and cryptocurrency firm GMO Internet (T:9449) were rejected at its AGM last week.
But Oasis said it was encouraged by the fact that some of its proposals won support from nearly 90 percent of minority shareholders who voted, including some domestic institutional shareholders.
Their proposals were voted down largely because of a 41 percent stake its founder and CEO Masatoshi Kumagai and his personal office hold.
""This vote makes it clear that investors in Japan will stand up and make their voices heard by voting for positive corporate governance changes, against recommendations of management, whose interests have unfortunately deviated from what's best for the company and all stakeholders,"" said Seth Fischer, founder and Chief Investment Officer at Oasis.
GMO's Kumagai said he appreciates that Oasis's proposals are aimed at boost GMO's value, and asked other investors to understand that management and Oasis are not in confrontation.
Meanwhile, San Francisco-based activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital, a mostly long-term value investor, said it was considering making its first investment in Japan this year. 
Allison Bennington, partner of the fund, said ValueAct is aware that activist funds have long been viewed as ""vultures"" in Japan but its approach will be more constructive.

Billionaire Masayoshi Son could buttress the finances of his diverse SoftBank empire with steady cashflows from reinsurance through the acquisition. The Tokyo-based group has raised $93 billion out of a planned $100 billion for the world’s biggest private equity pool, while taking stakes in businesses including ride-hailing, chipmaking and office sharing.
SoftBank is holding talks to buy the stake at about 100 Swiss francs to 105 Swiss francs a share, the people said, declining to be identified as the deliberations are confidential. At 105 francs, the deal would represent a 16 percent premium over Swiss Re shares’ close on Feb. 7 -- before the company confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that it was in talks -- and value the holding at about $9.6 billion.
Swiss Re gained as much as 3.2 percent in Zurich trading and was up 2.9 percent at 97.88 francs as of 9:08 a.m. The stock has climbed 10 percent in the last 12 months.
The terms of the potential deal are still fluid and may change, and the companies may fail to reach an agreement, the people said. SoftBank declined to comment. A Swiss Re representative wasn’t immediately available to comment.
“Swiss Re may offer interesting opportunities for business transformation, especially in its ailing Corporate Solutions business,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Ivan Bokhmat wrote in a note to clients. “The end target is still not clear for Softbank -- a minority investment will not allow it to control investment policy or growth priorities for Swiss Re.”
Insurance Deals
The insurance industry is experiencing a flurry of dealmaking as companies come on the market after a rash of natural disasters depressed valuations and an influx of competitors made it harder to raise rates. France’s Axa SA this month agreed to buy XL Group Ltd. for $15.3 billion in cash to capture a bigger slice of the U.S. property and casualty market, while American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG). in January decided to buy the Bermuda-based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd. for $5.56 billion in cash.
Swiss Re’s chief executive officer last month said the company would welcome a long-term investor. In a business where results can change radically from one year to the next, “it’s not a bad thing to have an anchor shareholder,” Christian Mumenthaler said at a conference in Zurich.
The reinsurer last month said it plans to raise its dividend and return an additional $1 billion to shareholders.

LONDON (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings (N:AMC) is working with Citi (N:C) on an initial public offering (IPO) of Britain's Odeon cinemas group, three sources familiar with the matter said.
New York-listed AMC said in November it may pursue a London IPO of Odeon, which now includes Nordic Cinema, the largest cinema chain in the Nordic and Baltic regions, by the middle of 2019, keen to take advantage of higher valuations in European markets. 
""It has not escaped our notice that even though European public markets value movie theaters at double-digit EBITDA (earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization) multiples, we are not seeing such valuations for our European assets at these levels when they are buried within AMC,"" AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said on a call in November.
Three sources familiar with the matter said Citi was working on a London float for the chain, which could value it at more than $2 billion. AMC, which is majority owned by China's Dalian Wanda Group, has been introducing recliner seating and alcohol sales in European cinemas to help boost returns.
Citi, which advised AMC on its $652 million Nordic Cinema acquisition in 2017, declined to comment. AMC, which operates around 1,000 theaters with approximately 11,000 screens globally, did not respond to an emailed request for comment. 
The adjusted EBITDA for AMC's international business grew 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter to $92.8 million and 7.8 percent to $244.8 million for the full year on a constant currency basis.
According to Reuters data, AMC is trading at enterprise value of around 8 times EBITDA while Odeon competitor Cineworld (L:CINE) is trading at enterprise value of 17 times EBITDA. Based on these estimates, Odeon could achieve a valuation of between $2 and $4 billion including debt.

938,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Brexit Half Time Sees Pound Shunned by Europe's Biggest Funds,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s half time in the waiting game for Brexit and some of Europe’s top funds are still struggling to find a reason to buy the pound.
Twelve months after the U.K. triggered the two-year process of its withdrawal from the European Union, the two sides haven’t even got round to starting trade talks and that’s prompting Amundi SA to maintain a short position on sterling. While a transition deal signed this month buoyed the British currency, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors GmbH warns that markets may be underestimating risks and is bearish on the pound.
Expectations that the Bank of England could raise interest rates as early as May have helped sterling outperform most Group-of-10 peers this year, but AXA Investment Managers remains skeptical about the odds of policy tightening amid lingering economic uncertainties. Option volatility on the U.K. currency has averaged higher this quarter as the nation faced an industrial slowdown and subdued consumer confidence.
“The transition deal has not removed political uncertainty from the U.K.,” said Didier Borowski, head of macroeconomic research at Amundi, Europe’s largest money manager that oversees over 1.4 trillion euros ($1.7 trillion) in assets. “We are still in the middle of nowhere and are very much unclear concerning the final deal that will be negotiated. So we are still very, very cautious concerning our exposure to the currency and British equity markets.”
‘Too Complacent’
While the pound is the third-best G-10 performer this year with a 4.1 percent gain to about $1.4060, it has retreated 2 percent from a high of $1.4345 in January. Implied volatility on three-month sterling-dollar options averaged 8.3 percent this quarter, compared with 7.8 percent in the previous three months, showing traders are concerned about future price swings.
The currency plunged to a 31-year low in October 2016, following the U.K.’s June vote to leave the EU. Even as the 18 percent rebound since then reflects improved sentiment, the market may now be overlooking the fact that uncertainties remain, according to Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz.
“The market is now far too complacent,” he said. “Markets have gone from being over-concerned about the fallout from Brexit, to flipping the other way.”
Tour of Brexit Britain Finds an Angry, Disunited Nation in Limbo
Riddell remains bullish on U.K. government bonds but is “particularly more fearful for sterling if things don’t pan out as well as” expected. A deterioration in U.K. economic data could drive 10-year gilt yields below 1.30 percent in the next 12 months from 1.36 percent currently, he said.
Not all money managers are bearish on the British currency.
Pacific Investment Management Co. has a long pound position versus the euro, betting that the risk of Brexit negotiations collapsing is now “incrementally lower,” Andrew Balls, chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Wednesday.
Aberdeen Standard Investments is upbeat on the pound’s short-term prospects after the transition deal, but refrains from taking a long-term call given the political risks. The pound could rise against the euro toward pre-Brexit vote levels of around 76 pence by year-end from about 88 pence currently, said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at the firm.
Pound bulls are betting on rate increases by the BOE, with money markets currently pricing in an 83 percent chance of a move in May, and some predicting a second hike toward the end of the year. If the central bank pauses after one rate increase this year, trade-weighted sterling could slide five percent, according to Allianz’s Riddell.
Nothing Agreed
AXA Investment’s Chris Iggo remains unconvinced the BOE will tighten policy at a time when the economic fallout from Brexit is still unclear.
“I find it hard to see the BOE raising rates in the final year of Brexit negotiations when we don’t know what the final trade deal will look like,” Iggo, AXA’s chief investment officer for fixed income, wrote in a client note. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”
The one thing fund managers agree on is that positioning for what the next 12 months have in store is difficult.
“The eventual outcome is not a straightforward thing to get right in its entirety, which means you have to look to short-term negotiations instead,” Aberdeen’s Hickmore said. “The chance of being wrong increases, the longer time horizon you have. The old adage about a week in politics being a very long time is well worth remembering.”

939,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Volkswagen offers to buy back diesel cars as German bans loom,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it would offer to buy back diesel vehicles if German cities ban them and also extended incentives for potential buyers of diesel cars to battle a slump in demand.
Cities in Germany can now ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from their streets after a court ruling in February. Many German cities exceed European Union limits on atmospheric nitrogen oxide, known to cause respiratory diseases.
At Volkswagen's core VW brand, the carmaker said its buyback offer applied to new diesel vehicles bought between April 1 and the end of 2018 and kicks in if the city in which the buyer lives or works bans diesels within three years of the purchase.
It said its dealerships would buy back diesel vehicles affected by bans at their current value if their owners at the same time bought a new vehicle that is not impacted by cities' driving restrictions.
At Czech brand Skoda, the guarantee applies to cars bought between April 1 and end-June but applies if bans are put in place within four years of the purchase date. At Audi, the offer is for leased vehicles.
At the same time, Volkswagen said it was extending to the end of June incentives for customers trading in older diesel models for new ones.

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery among cyclical sectors and a raft of M&A news helped boost European shares further on Thursday, shaking off a tech-led sell-off which had spread across global markets earlier in the week.
Auto stocks (SXAP) led gains as  Renault  (PA:RENA) jumped 6.4 percent to a more than 10-year high after Bloomberg reported Nissan and Renault were in talks to merge.
Hopes of dealmaking spread to other auto stocks, driving them up too.  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose 1.6 to 3.3 percent. 
Cyclical industrials, autos, and banking stocks drove the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.2 percent. The index was still set for its worst quarter in two years, however, suffering a 5 percent decline. 
Starting with a stellar rally in global equities in January, this quarter developed into a challenging one for stock markets with investors navigating a sharp spike in volatility, rumbling trade tensions and anxiety over the tech sector.
In Europe, slowing macroeconomic indicators have been taken as a ""sell"" signal for the region's equities, which had enjoyed a lift most of last year as a narrative of stronger economic growth took hold. 
""Support from attractive valuations and fading FX headwinds is not enough to override the signal from relative macro surprises,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) equity analysts, reaffirming their underweight position on European equities versus the U.S.
M&A news was the main driver on Thursday.
Besides Renault,  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) was also a top gainer, up 2.3 percent after a report that Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which has been in deal talks with the reinsurance firm, is looking to buy a 25 percent stake. [L8N1RB1CB]
Meanwhile services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) sank 15 percent after cutting its full-year sales and profit margin outlook, reporting a weaker than expected second quarter.
""Given management guidance, we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share price pressures, near term,"" said UBS analysts.
Peers  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) and  Compass Group  (L:CPG) also declined 2.2 to 2.4 percent, making the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) the worst-performing. 
While cyclicals were ruling the roost on Thursday, defensive sectors have enjoyed something of a revival in recent weeks as investors rushed to the areas of the market traditionally seen as safer, with stable earnings and high dividends.
""Should concerns about a trade war escalate, defensive stocks would likely outperform ... We would be wary of cyclicals, in particular international ones,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.

Positioning on cyclicals is elevated,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts found. Both European and global funds have increased their cyclicals exposure to near the highest levels in the last decade, adding especially to financials, tech and industrials.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>","Tesla returned to German subsidies list, ending row","FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla (O:TSLA) buyers in Germany can apply for subsidies again because a government agency has ended its dispute with the U.S. carmaker over whether its Model S was too expensive to qualify for the incentives scheme.
An independent assessment proved that a base version of the Model S was available for less than the 60,000 euros ($74,000) baseline and the cars are thus eligible, the German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Controls (BAFA) told Reuters. 
Germany in 2016 launched the incentive scheme worth about 1 billion euros and partly financed by the German car industry to boost electric car usage but it includes a baseline to exempt premium models.
BAFA unexpectedly took Tesla's vehicles off the list in December, saying customers could not order the Model S base version without extra features that pushed the car above the price limit.
Tesla denied at the time that the no-frills version was not available and said on Thursday a model was always available below the cut-off price.
BAFA said it was nonetheless reviewing previously approved applications for subsidies, which could mean that buyers may be asked to repay subsidies they have already received.
BAFA has received a total of 1,275 applications for subsidies of Tesla purchases, according to its website. It was not immediately clear how many of those were approved before the agency removed Tesla from its list in December.
Under the subsidy scheme, buyers get 4,000 euros off their all-electric vehicle purchase and 3,000 euros off plug-in hybrids.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:03AM ET</span>",Exchange operator CME Group to buy Britain's NEX for $5.5 billion,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. exchange operator CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has made a $5.5 billion offer to buy NEX Group to create a cross-border powerhouse for investors trading in the multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange and government debt markets.
Shareholders in NEX, a financial technology firm that matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, will receive 500 pence in cash for each NEX share and 0.0444 new CME shares. Each NEX share would be valued at 1,000 pence, CME said.
The offer by CME, one of the world's biggest exchange groups and owner of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, represents a 2.9 percent premium to Wednesday's share close of 972 pence.
A union of the two firms would enable investors to access cash and futures trading and over-the-counter services via one provider for the first time, improving access to markets, NEX's founder and Chief Executive Michael Spencer said in a statement.
CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy said the new entity would help investors lower trading expenses and better manage risk.
Analysts said CME may have been prompted to bid now to avoid losing out to a rival, as global exchanges face rising competition for business amid shrinking trade volumes.
""This is a good price,"" Liberum analyst Justin Bates said, but added that the 50 percent cash component might disappoint some investors leaving ""the door ajar for a competing offer with a higher cash component.""
He said potential bidders could include ICE, Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and London Stock Exchange (LSE) (LSE), with ICE the most likely frontrunner. 
The stock was trading below the offer price at 968 pence at 1020 GMT on Thursday, after climbing 30 percent in 2017. 
The takeover could spook regulators concerned about the potential dominance of a new entity in some markets, especially U.S. government debt, where CME is already in the top position.
Previous major exchange mergers, such as the one between the LSE and Deutsche Boerse, have hit antitrust buffers in recent years.
NEX provides foreign exchange and fixed income trading technology via its EBS and BrokerTec platforms.
EBS, a foreign exchange matching platform, allows banks and other major institutions to trade the euro, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar, connecting buyers and sellers of currencies in more than 50 countries.
BrokerTec is the market leader for electronic trading in many U.S and European fixed income products, including U.S. Treasuries, European Government Bonds and European Repo.
""It's a company that has always been ripe for acquisition,"" Matthew Page, fund manager at Guinness Asset Management and one of NEX's 25 largest investors, told Reuters, adding CME probably thought ""they’ve got to make a move for it now or it might get snapped up by someone else."" 
(Graphic: Brexit volatility kick-starts NEX share rally - https://reut.rs/2pMWOvc)
EFFICIENCIES 
The deal would expand CME's international footprint in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific, CME said, adding it expected the acquisition to generate run rate cost savings of $200 million by the end of 2021.
CME said the deal would add to its cash adjusted earnings per share from 2019, with a one-time cash cost of $285 million. 
After the deal, Spencer would join CME's board and become a special adviser to the firm, CME said.
Spencer is a high-profile figure in London's financial industry who previously served as treasurer for Britain's ruling conservative party. NEX Group was known as ICAP (LON:NXGN) before the sale of its voice-broking business to TP ICAP in 2016.
NEX's directors intended to recommend the offer to shareholders, the exchange operator added. 
""CME's decision to choose London as its European headquarters is also a signal of tremendous support for Britain's financial services sector,"" Spencer said.
The combined headquarters will be in Chicago.
NEX, which has picked Amsterdam as its European Union hub after Britain leaves the bloc, said last month its markets had been more active in 2018 as forex volatility rose from historic lows. Spencer said potential interest rate rises were expected to boost volumes further.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 07:07AM ET</span>","Lured by rising SUV sales, automakers flood market with models","By Nick Carey
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for sport utility vehicles in the United States is booming, but the number of new models vying for a share of that market is growing even faster, threatening the fat profits automakers have enjoyed.
At the New York Auto show this week, automakers will unveil another flock of SUVs ranging from a revamped Toyota RAV4, Toyota Motor Corp's top-selling model in 2017, to flashy new luxury Cadillac and Lincoln SUVs. Premium brands such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Maserati that once dealt exclusively in low-slung sports cars are getting into the game.
""I think everyone has read the same tea leaves - right now there seems to be insatiable demand,"" said General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Johan de Nysschen, referring to SUVs and crossovers.
De Nysschen, the head of GM's Cadillac luxury division, spoke to Reuters on Wednesday while standing next to the brand's new XT4 crossover model. ""Everyone is going into these segments with compelling new entries,"" he said, ""and that means there are going to be winners and there are going to be losers.""
He added: ""We aim to be amongst the winners.""
According to data from automotive consultancy LMC Automotive, by the year 2023 there will be 90 mainstream SUV and crossover models on the U.S. market, as well as 90 luxury models, compared with the 2017 levels of 65 mainstream SUV and crossover models and 53 luxury models. 
Premium automakers like BMW AG and Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand are expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.
U.S. sales of mainstream and luxury SUVs and crossovers alike have more than doubled since 2010 and rose 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, last year - even though overall industry sales declined 2 percent in 2017.
LMC Automotive forecasts that growth will slow for SUVs and crossovers in 2018 and every year through 2025, even as the number of models on the market is set to rise.
For an interactive graphic on ""The Rise of the SUV,"" see: (https://tmsnrt.rs/2I6YBSX)
""There are still some legs left to grow in the SUV market, but growth is slowing and will eventually level off,"" said Jeff Schuster, LMC's senior vice president of forecasting. ""This is a bright spot in the market, which is why everyone is flocking to it with new product.""
Over the next few years millions of nearly new SUV and crossover models will come off lease and return to market, providing cheap competition for new models.
Around 40 percent of the roughly 4 million nearly new vehicles that will come off lease in 2018 in the United States will be SUVs and crossovers, rising to 44 percent in 2019 and 47 percent in 2020, according to Cox Automotive forecasts. 
""Now that you're seeing more SUVs starting to come off lease, that will automatically put pressure on new SUV pricing,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher for automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB). 
'SIMPLE MATH'
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting with AutoForecast Solutions, has a more optimistic view of the automakers' chances. Just as a wide variety of niches has developed in the passenger car market, as SUV and crossover sales continue to grow there is room for automakers to roll out an assortment of sizes, limited editions and sporty models.
""The market is not yet saturated and there are all kinds of niches that have yet to be filled,"" Fiorani said. ""We're five or 10 years from even thinking about market saturation.""
Automakers also maintain that there is room for many more options as long as they can stand out in a crowd.
""There are clearly a lot of entrants, but we are going to differentiate ourselves with a completely different look to our brand,"" Joy Falotico, head of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's luxury Lincoln division, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Ford's new midsize SUV with three rows of seats, the Aviator, will hit the U.S. market in 2019. Rather than the aggressive or dominant forms adopted by Lincoln's competitors, Falotico said the Aviator's form is meant to evoke ""beauty and calmness.""
But according to KBB's Brauer, ""Simple math suggests that you'll have more models with lower volume.""
""You can't have that many SUVs on the market and have all of them grow volume,"" he said. ""Some of them are going to have to give.""
Brauer points to average vehicle prices in the SUV and crossover market for an indication of what is happening in the segment. Cumulatively, prices rose just 4 percent from 2012 to 2017.
But the average price dipped 0.5 percent to $35,991 in 2017 from $36,163 in 2016, according to KBB data.
Faced with more competition in a slower-growing market, automakers will likely be forced to resort to consumer discounts to boost sales, which will cut in to profit margins. 

""The idea that you're going to make the same profit as you did three years ago is probably unlikely,"" Brauer said. ""The good news is that they have room to lower margins.""

(Reuters) - Volkswagen has taken parking lots to a whole new level in the United States - and will not be emptying them soon.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) has paid more than $7.4 billion to buy back about 350,000 U.S. diesel vehicles through mid-February, a recent court filing shows. The German automaker has been storing hundreds of thousands of vehicles around the United States for months.
Volkswagen has 37 secure storage facilities around the United States housing nearly 300,000 vehicles, the filing from the program's independent administrator said. The lots include a shuttered suburban Detroit football stadium, a former Minnesota paper mill and a sun-bleached desert graveyard near Victorville, California.
VW spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said in a statement on Wednesday that the storage facility in Victorville, California, is one of many ""to ensure the responsible storage of vehicles that are bought back under the terms of the Volkswagen"" diesel settlements. 
""These vehicles are being stored on an interim basis and routinely maintained in a manner to ensure their long-term operability and quality, so that they may be returned to commerce or exported once U.S. regulators approve appropriate emissions modifications,"" she said.
In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buy backs will continue through the end of 2019.
The court filing said through Dec. 31 Volkswagen had reacquired 335,000 diesel vehicles, resold 13,000 and destroyed about 28,000 vehicles. As of the end of last year, VW was storing 294,000 vehicles around the country. 
VW must buy back or fix 85 percent of the vehicles involved by June 2019 or face higher payments for emissions.
The company said in February it has repaired or fixed nearly 83 percent of covered vehicles and expects to soon hit the requirement.
Through mid-February VW has issued 437,273 letters offering nearly $8 billion in compensation and buybacks.

In April 2017 Volkswagen was sentenced to three years probation after pleading guilty to three felony counts and paid $4.3 billion in federal penalties. The automaker in September 2015 admitted to circumventing the emissions control system in U.S. diesel vehicles for vehicles sold since 2009, prompting the resignation of the company's chief executive.

Japan’s February retail sales rose 1.6% compared to last year, slightly lower than the expected 1.7% increase. The country’s deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso ruled out the possibility of a bilateral trade deal with the U.S., adding that such deal would bring no benefits to Japan.
""When two countries negotiate, the stronger country gets stronger"" and would only create ""unnecessary"" pain for Japan, Aso told parliament. ""We've been saying all along that we would definitely avoid bilateral trade deals with the United States,” said Aso. Japan has been reportedly pushing for exemptions from U.S. tariffs in recent weeks.
""Japan only exports special steel products in which it has outstanding market share and U.S. companies cannot produce,"" Aso said. ""If U.S. companies want these products, they need to buy them from Japan. It will be U.S. companies that suffer.""

The ride-hailing service uses Nvidia's graphics processing units known as GPUs, Huang told an audience on the final day of Nvidia's GPU conference in San Jose, California. 
""Uber does not use Nvidia DRIVE technology. Uber develops its own sensing and drive technology,"" Huang said in response to a question asked at the conference. 
The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors.
Huang's comments provide more detail as to the relationship between Nvidia and Uber, one of its many partners.
Nvidia's shares have fallen by about 9.5 percent since the company said on Tuesday it was temporarily halting its self-driving tests on public roads out of respect for the victim in the March 18 accident involving an Uber self-driving vehicle. An investigation is ongoing. 
The chipmaker is continuing tests on closed enclosures, the chief executive said. 

Uber suspended self-driving tests in North America after an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona earlier in the month.

In an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain, Olaf Scholz expressed scepticism that changes in taxation - for instance, scrapping tax breaks for diesel as a fuel - would speed moves by the car industry to introduce cleaner cars.
He also rejected calls for the government to offer financial incentives to get more clean-burning diesel cars on the road and bring down emissions in heavily polluted cities.
""It is the task of industry to develop vehicles that meet existing and future rules for clean air,"" Scholz told the newspaper group, adding: ""We must talk seriously about how we can get more electric cars or expand public transportation.""
Scholz, who owns a diesel car himself, said he shared other drivers' concerns about limited access to certain areas in the future, if driving bans were imposed. ""We must do all we can to prevent driving bans for diesel vehicles,"" he said.
Instead, he said cities and local communities seeking to reduce overall emissions should build more charging stations to promote use of electric cars and buses, and the car industry should accelerate its work on clean car technologies.
""Industry must deliver now. It would be good if such a technological advance came from Germany.""
Scholz, a Social Democrat, joined conservative Transportation Minister Andreas Scheuer and Chancellor Angela Merkel in speaking out against comprehensive diesel driving bans.

Merkel last week told lawmakers she favored tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A potential acquisition of London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP) by Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) was greeted with investor scepticism about it merits on Thursday, with shares in the Japanese drug maker tumbling 7 percent.
Takeda, currently worth some $39 billion, is smaller than Shire, a rare disease specialist which saw its stock jump 16 percent to be valued at some $45 billion after the Japanese firm said it was in a ""preliminary and exploratory stage"" of considering a bid.
That similarity in size had raised the question whether the damage to Takeda's finances would be worth the boost to its portfolio and pipeline. 
""The impression left by the news is that the acquisition would be an overreach,"" said Mizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Tanaka in a note to clients.
Any deal is expected to involve some form of equity, whether that be a share swap or a share issue, analysts also said, noting a share issue could be highly dilutive for Takeda shareholders.
Takeda said an acquisition of Shire, which also sells treatments for attention deficit disorder, could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boost its position in the United States and in the fields of oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience.
But some analysts also doubted whether Shire's treatments for haemophilia and other rare diseases would benefit Takeda and thought that any deal should be more targeted.
""We think neuroscience assets alone, which Shire said are under strategic review, would be a realistic target, but we find it hard to imagine Takeda acquiring all of Shire,"" said UBS analyst Atsushi Seki. 
""We think the possibility of it making a proposal is very low, but its share price will likely be under pressure from concern over potential dilution.""
Takeda's potential bid for Shire, most of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry.
In recent months, France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) agreed to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ  for $11.6 billion and Belgium's  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX) for 3.9 billion euros ($4.8 billion). Before that, U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bought cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics . 
Japanese companies, faced with a rapidly shrinking population, are seen as particularly acquisitive. Takeda, founded in 1781 as a purveyor of traditional herbal medicine, has sought to internationalise through deals under its French CEO Christophe Weber, who took over in 2015.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets and other riskier assets steadied on Thursday as investors dusted themselves down after a woeful week for the tech sector, readying for what was set to be the first quarterly drop in global equities in two years.
Wall Street futures were up and banks and consumer stocks helped Europe's main bourses 0.2-0.4 percent higher as the region built on a positive session for Asia's heavyweight Nikkei, Hang Seng and Chinese markets.
For currencies traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to Q4 growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in six months on Wednesday. 
The tentative return of risk appetite and looming U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Bunds and Treasuries.
Benchmark yields - which move inversely to prices - on German government bonds crept back above 0.5 percent, having been on a sharp slide for most of the month. Spanish yields meanwhile headed for their biggest monthly fall since mid-2016. [GVD/EUR]
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.773 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent overnight amid the strains on Wall Street.
""I think most of these markets are staring at the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 to see if it breaks,"" said Societe Generale's Kit Juckes.
""I think euro/dollar is stuck in its range with superglue... but I think if there is going to be another surprise in Q2 it will be yen strength again.""
Wall Street futures were pointing to a marginally higher open. (N) Shares of the so-called FANG group - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – were up between 0.60 and 1.6 percent in pre-market trading.
All three major U.S. indexes ended in the red again on Wednesday with $30 billion wiped off Amazon's shares alone after reports U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to rein in the firm's power in online retailing.
Including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the FANGs as a set are still up 14 percent so far this year, but privacy concerns in the wake of Facebook's scandal nearly two week back has wiped $400 billion off their value. 
The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets more broadly has brought an end to one of the longest ever quarterly bull runs - and there have been few places to hide.
Investors have had it all thrown at them, from the biggest ever rise in stock volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major tech sector wobbles.
A ""melt-up"" that sent the MSCI's world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE Nikkei and scores of other big markets are all down for the year.
""We have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes the higher the chance it will start to affect the man on the street,"" said the Head of Equities at London & Capital, Roger Jones.

GOLDEN GLOW
In Asia overnight, Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.6 percent, Shanghai closed more than 1.2 percent higher and Hong Kong's Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent. 
Helping the mood were media reports that Japan had sounded out North Korea's government about a bilateral summit, and that Pyongyang had also discussed the possibility of a broader meeting with other global leaders.
Beijing had said on Wednesday that North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un had pledged his commitment to denuclearization at meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The greenback was 0.3 percent lower against the yen - often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions - at 106.46 yen on Thursday. The greenback had rallied 1.4 percent on Wednesday on perceived progress over the North Korea issue, having set a 16-month trough of 104.560 on Monday.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was flat at just under 90 after reaching a one-week high of 90.147.
""Expansionary U.S. fiscal policy should support global trade, but markets will remain attentive to further tensions as the China-U.S. trade saga continues to unfold,"" wrote economists at ANZ.
The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.2319 losing 0.75 percent on Wednesday and after German inflation data was not quite as spritely as forecast.
Sterling was flat at $1.4080 after shedding 0.5 percent overnight on news British retail sales fell in March for the first time in five months.
It has however had its best quarter since early 2015, and not only against a dollar which is locked in its worst run since the financial crisis, but also versus the euro.
In commodities, U.S. crude futures slipped 0.2 percent to $64.28 a barrel after dropping 1 percent the previous day when data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week. 
Brent shed 0.4 percent to $69.23 a barrel after losing 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Brent has risen more than 6 percent this month though, with OPEC and other suppliers expected to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019.
Gold was steady at $1,323 an ounce. Another sign of the stress in markets is that it is set for its third straight quarterly gain.

GM Korea also plans to ask GM to cut interest rates on loans extended to the South Korean operation, the source said. The plans were approved by GM Korea's board late on Wednesday, he said. 
The move comes after GM, which in February announced plans to shut down one of its factories in South Korea, warned that it would run out of cash in the first quarter. 
GM said on Monday its South Korea unit would file for bankruptcy if its union did not agree to cut labor costs by April 20, heaping pressure on workers and the South Korean government to swiftly agree to a rescue plan. 
A GM Korea spokesman said GM Korea held a board meeting on Wednesday, but he was not aware of decisions made at the meeting. 
In February, GM also agreed to grant temporary relief in repaying a 720 billion won debt coming due that month, the person said.

GM has lent its South Korean unit about $2.7 billion, charging interest of about 5 percent a year, GM Korea’s latest regulatory filing shows.

Factories churned out 145,475 vehicles last month, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). 
""Another month of double-digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week's Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
London and Brussels agreed a deal which will see Britain retain free and unfettered trade with the European Union until at least the end of 2020 - 21 months after it formally leaves the EU - although trading arrangements after that date are subject to future talks.
The SMMT has called on Prime Minister Theresa May to secure a long-term agreement that maintains Britain's competitiveness, since several investment decisions loom in the next 12 months.

(Reuters) - Chicago's City Council on Wednesday approved a multibillion-dollar expansion plan for O'Hare International Airport, after an earlier dispute between the airport's two largest carriers had previously threatened to snarl the project.
""We are investing in capacity, technology and modern facilities that will elevate the customer experience and significantly improve operational efficiencies with our historic $8.5 billion expansion plan,"" Ginger Evans, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation, said in a statement.
The city of Chicago entered into an agreement with carriers United Airlines (N:UAL), American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) for airport renovations that include expanding the airport's existing terminals and increasing the number and availability of some gates.
United and American - the airport's two largest airlines - had previously disagreed over the number of gates that would be allocated to each carrier, with American in February accusing United of having engaged in a ""last-minute secret deal with the city"" to snare additional gates.
Earlier this month, the two resolved the dispute, with Chicago agreeing to speed up construction of three common-use gates that will come into use at roughly the same time United gets five additional gates.
American Airlines and its affiliated carriers accounted for 35.5 percent of passengers at O'Hare in 2016, compared with 44.5 percent for United carriers, according to city data.
""We commend the mayor and his team for reaching an agreement that ensures O'Hare gives Chicago a competitive edge long into the future and provides our great city the world-class airport it deserves,"" United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement.
American also hailed the deal, saying its approval is ""what is best for the city of Chicago.""
The city on Wednesday also approved an initial $4 billion of airport revenue bonds to help finance the overall project. The bonds are intended to fund portions of the new O'Hare Terminal Area Plan and the Capital Improvement Plan.
The cash will also help refund outstanding bonds in an effort to save money on prior finance deals. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citibank and Loop Capital Markets are the lead underwriters for selling the debt.

O'Hare is the world's second-busiest airport in terms of take-offs and landings after Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport, according to an Airports Council International 2016 ranking.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ousted Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin on Wednesday in response to heavy criticism and nominated his personal physician, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, to replace him in the latest turnover among Trump's team.
White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Shulkin had become a distraction due to a constant wave of speculation about his future and said he would be leaving in the next day or two. They said an undersecretary at the Department of Defense, Robert Wilkie, will be the acting secretary.
Shulkin had drawn fire for a damning report from the inspector general of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It found that during a trip to London and Denmark he improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and his chief of staff made false statements so Shulkin's wife could travel at government expense.
One official said the criticism of Shulkin was ""making it harder for him to carry out the duties of secretary of the VA, which is something the president has made clear is a big priority for him.""
Jackson, a rear admiral of the U.S. Navy, has been working as a presidential physician since the George W. Bush administration, and has been the lead doctor monitoring Trump's health since Trump became president.
Jackson gave Trump a clean bill of health early this year after giving the president a physical. He put him on a diet to lose some weight and directed him to get some exercise. Aides said Trump has been eating more fish and fewer cheeseburgers lately.
A Texas native who has been on active duty since 1995, Jackson served during the U.S.-led war in Iraq as an emergency medicine physician in Taqaddum, Iraq.
""Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a service member himself, he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them,"" Trump said.
A White House official said Trump warmed to Jackson and had been aware that Shulkin had sought to make Jackson the VA undersecretary last year.
""The president wants somebody who gives him the best possible care to go over and give that same care to the veterans. That's how strongly he feels about getting them represented properly,"" the official said.
Trump said he appreciated Shulkin's work, including passage of the VA Accountability Act.""He has been a great supporter of veterans across the country and I am grateful for his service,"" Trump said in a statement.
U.S. Representative Phil Roe, a Republican who chairs the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, said he hated to see Shulkin go but respected Trump's decision.
""At the end of the day, cabinet secretaries serve at the pleasure of the president,"" he said.
Will Fischer, director of government relations for the VoteVets lobby group, said his group hopes Jackson will oppose any attempt to privatize the VA or its health services, a concept that Republicans talk about occasionally.
""If Dr. Jackson can do that, immediately, he will do a lot to help his chances at confirmation,"" Fischer said.
The VA oversees healthcare and benefits going to roughly 20 million U.S. military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, provides care at more than 1,200 facilities, including 170 VA Medical Centers, to more than 9 million veterans.
Trump praised Shulkin as ""fantastic"" when he chose him to head the VA in January 2017. Trump, who promised improved veterans' care during his presidential campaign, last year said the department had made ""tremendous progress"" under Shulkin.
But support for him at the White House eroded quickly in recent weeks as Trump grew weary of the drumbeat of negative headlines about him.
Shulkin said after the release of the inspector general's report that he would comply with its recommendations, including reimbursing the government for his wife's $4,312 airfare and paying his friend for the Wimbledon tickets. The department announced two days after the report was issued that Shulkin's chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, would retire.

Shulkin joins a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Trump took office in January 2017. Others include Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, FBI chief James Comey and FBI No. 2 Andrew McCabe, Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon, national security advisers H.R. McMaster and Michael Flynn, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, communications directors Hope Hicks and Anthony Scaramucci, and economic adviser Gary Cohn.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven U.S. states and 16 major automakers are launching a joint $1.5 million advertising campaign to prod Americans to buy electric vehicles.
Automakers are investing billions of dollars to develop dozens of new EVs in the face of regulatory requirements, but face slow U.S. sales.
General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and many other companies, along with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.
The campaign, dubbed ""Drive Change. Drive Electric,"" will focus on the benefits of electric cars.
""Far too many drivers remain unfamiliar with the benefits of driving electric. Increasing sales of electric cars will deliver critical environmental and economic benefits across the region,” said Arthur Marin, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management.
Electric vehicle sales rose 25 percent in 2017 to a new record but still account for only 1.2 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.
The campaign will initially focus in the northeast region and includes a website, advertising, social media, strategic partnerships and events and other content efforts.
John Bozzella, who heads Global Automakers, a trade group whose members include Toyota,  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267), said more education efforts are needed as automakers offer dozens of EV models.
""The companies are effectively ahead of the customer,"" Bozzella said in an interview. ""We need to collectively help tell the story of the benefits of this technology and raise awareness.""
Automakers are rapidly investing in EVs and say they plan to unveil dozens of new EVs in the coming years. They point to the growing range of EVs to travel on a single charge, lower battery costs and more recharging stations as all making the vehicles more attractive to customers.
Joe Eberhardt, president and chief executive officer of Jaguar Land Rover North America, said in an interview at the auto show that companies must focus on consumer demand not regulatory mandates. ""We need as an industry to find a way to convince customers that there is a real benefit and advantage to having an electric vehicle,"" he said.
In January,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said it would double its electrified vehicle spending. Reuters reported that global automakers plan to invest $90 billion in batteries and electric cars in the coming years, an amount that is still growing.
Investments in electrified vehicles announced to date include at least $19 billion by automakers in the United States, $21 billion in China and $52 billion in Germany.

Automakers also are reacting to pressure from regulators in Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels and mandates from California to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles.""

963,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. All Eyes on U.S. Inflation
A raft of data including a crucial inflation report wraps up the trading week on Thursday a day ahead of the Good Friday holiday.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – is expected to show 1.6% growth for February year-on-year, up from 1.5% the prior month.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said earlier in March that it expects Core-PCE inflation to rise to 1.9% by year-end, close to the Fed’s target of 2%.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is expected to remain steady at 0.2%. The Federal Reserve in its March’s monetary policy statement said that despite strong job gains, consumer spending has moderated from a strong showing in the fourth quarter.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended March 24, expected to show jobless claims rose to 230,000 from 229,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are forecast to rise to 1.8756 million from 1.828 million the prior week.
The dollar rose sharply against a basket of major currencies Wednesday, boosted by a slump in the yen amid easing concerns from the land-plot scandal engulfing Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, U.S. Rig Count Data in Focus
Natural gas prices are roughly unchanged in March as traders await the final inventory update of the month.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage fell by 70 billion cubic feet last week.
Amid the shortened trading week, Baker Hughes is slated to release its rig count data a day earlier Thursday. The number of oil rigs operating in the US rose to a three-year high last week, according to data from Baker Hughes.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures remained on track to notch a monthly gain in March despite falling for three-straight days as traders continued to fret growing U.S. production, while a larger-than-expected build in crude supplies weighed on sentiment.
3. Nasdaq Set for First Back-to-Back Monthly Slump in More Than Two Years
The tech sector is expected to be closely watched Thursday after Amazon became the latest tech company to take the plunge amid reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is mulling a change to the company’s tax treatment.
The White House, however, said that there were “no announcements and no specific policies or actions” that are currently being pushed forward on Amazon.
Fears that Trump could target Amazon comes as media outlet Axios, citing sources, reported that the president “wants to go after” Amazon because “he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.”
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 4.38% to close at $1,431.42.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, rebounded from a more than 12% slump Tuesday as analysts backed the social media company, insisting that the selloff on data privacy concerns were overdone.
“We recognize that broader industry headlines around use of data and potential regulation may be around for some time, but we believe the pullback in Twitter shares on Data Licensing concerns is overdone and we would take advantage of recent weakness,” JPMorgan said Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Luxury U.S. automaker brands Cadillac and Lincoln both unveiled SUV models this week at the New York auto show to meet rising American demand, but also are keeping one eye on a growing Chinese appetite for the same vehicles, executives said.
Cadillac, General Motors Co's (N:GM) luxury division, unveiled the XT4, a sport crossover, at the New York auto show on Tuesday. 
Johan de Nysschen, who heads up the division, told Reuters on Wednesday that Cadillac is still in discussions with its Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) on rolling out the XT4 in that market, but he is optimistic that it will happen. 
""The (Chinese) volume potential played an important role in ensuring the financial feasibility for the investment in this (vehicle) program,"" de Nysschen said. 
After the XT4, Cadillac plans a larger SUV with three rows of seats in 2019. China is the world's largest auto market and accounts for more than half of Cadillac's sales. And as in the United States, more consumers in China are opting for SUVs instead of sedans. But Cadillac's de Nysschen said overall, the number of sedans should continue to grow in China.
""Our data indicate that by 2025, despite a contracting market share, the luxury sedan segment will be as big as the total Chinese luxury market today,"" he said. ""The (Chinese) market will almost treble over the next 10 years, so it's massively important to Cadillac.""
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Wednesday told investors at a conference on the sidelines of the New York show that selling more vehicles, such as the XT4, in China should drive ""a 100 percent increase in Cadillac profitability over the next four years.""
Separately, Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Lincoln brand unveiled a three-row mid-size SUV at the auto show on Wednesday. 
Consumers can buy the Aviator in a hybrid version, which Joy Falotico, head of the Lincoln division, said is aimed in part at the Chinese market with its looming government mandates for electric vehicles. 

Chinese buyers ""may have their parents in the back seat and they deserve the same stature as children,"" Falotico said. ""The fact that it’s a comfortable ride is a very important feature.""

970,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 07:35PM ET</span>",AT&T judge warns parties to hurry to make June 21 deadline,"By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - U.S. judge Richard Leon on Wednesday warned attorneys for the Department of Justice and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) to speed up the trial over the proposed merger of the large telecommunications company and  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), or risk missing the June 21 deadline to complete the deal.
Under the agreement, which had been extended from April 22, either company can pull out if the deal announced in October 2016 is not completed by the deadline. 
""Both sides need to sit down with their clients and their teams and make sure the have down what they need versus what they want,"" Leon said. ""If we are going to get this done prior to that date, we have to move.""
The U.S. government opposes the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner's Turner networks.
Wednesday was the fourth day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, that is due to last six to eight weeks. It has been delayed by one snow day.
In testimony that began late Tuesday and ended on Wednesday, Turner networks Chief Executive John Martin said the company had no incentive to hold back its CNN, TBS and TNT content from other distributors if parent Time Warner was bought by AT&T.
The government, however, claims Time Warner would hold back Turner content from distributors that compete with AT&T and DirecTV.
""I would like every distributor to carry every network I have and carry it at 100 percent penetration,"" Martin said, when cross-examined by AT&T attorney Daniel Petrocelli. 
Online streaming services, such as Dish Network Corp's Sling TV and Hulu, which cost subscribers $20 to $40 a month for a select number of networks live and on-demand, are important for Turner because revenue cable and satellite companies is slowing down, he said.
The Department of Justice also asked Marty Hinson, a marketing executive at Cox Communications, about HBO, Time Warner's premium channel. He said it was vital to attract new customers and keep old ones. 
When asked about government estimates that if AT&T bought Time Warner each subscriber's average monthly cable bill would rise by 45 cents, Hinson said Cox customers would end up paying ""tens of millions of dollars a year for the exact same content.""

In his cross exam, Petrocelli asked Hinson if he had ever seen documentation or been told that prices would go up or that it would withhold its programming. Hinson said, ""No.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's governor on Wednesday withdrew his labor reform proposal after the island's oversight board demanded additional measures, deepening a divide in the parties' efforts to reach a consensual turnaround plan for the bankrupt, storm-ravaged island. 
Governor Ricardo Rossello said demands made by the federally appointed board earlier on Wednesday would have made his labor reform plan ""impossible.""
""The board pretends to dictate the public policy of the government, and that, aside from being illegal, is unacceptable,"" Rossello said in a statement on Wednesday evening.
Puerto Rico is navigating both the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years caused by September's Hurricane Maria. 
The oversight board, appointed by the U.S. Congress in 2016, must approve a blueprint for Puerto Rico's fiscal turnaround, a document whose economic projections will dictate how much money the island has to repay its bondholders. 
The board can impose a plan unilaterally if it cannot reach an accord with Rossello.
The governor's draft plan, which forecasts just $6 billion for debt service over the next five years, sought to attract private employers by eliminating mandatory Christmas bonuses for private-sector employees, reducing vacation and sick days, and creating an at-will employment system on the island. Rossello also proposed raising the minimum wage. 
In a letter to the governor earlier on Wednesday, the board instructed Rossello to impose tight timelines on putting those measures in place, and made the wage hike conditional on meeting those benchmarks.
The board made other demands, most notably reiterating its call for 10 percent across-the-board cuts to public pensions.
Rossello on Wednesday called the pension cuts an ""unfair and abusive measure"" that ""will have my tenacious opposition.""
His hard-line position heightens tension with the board at a time when Rossello's administration is struggling to find allies. U.S. lawmakers and financial creditors have accused Puerto Rico of overstating its financial straits, while previous austerity moves have angered unions.
A unilateral turnaround plan by the board might provide Rossello political cover, but could spur public discontent on an island where many view the board's existence as an encroachment on sovereignty. 

Puerto Rico's public employee retirement systems are $50 billion underfunded and have no assets, with payments coming out of the island's general budget. It is one of only a few times in U.S. history a large-scale public pension has gone to a ""pay-as-you-go"" system.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) on Wednesday unveiled an all-new Altima sedan, and demonstrated the auto industry's problem adjusting new-model investments fast enough to keep pace with shifts in consumer demand.
The Altima, and rival midpriced sedans such as Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Camry and Honda Motor Co Ltd's (T:7267) Accord, used to be high-volume sellers, keeping assembly lines rolling full-time. All three automakers several years ago committed to significant redesigns of their sedans.
Since those investments were made, demand for midsized cars has collapsed in the United States due to the growing consumer appetite for larger SUVs and pickup trucks. Sales of sedans made up 36.8 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, down sharply from 51.2 percent in 2012. 
Through February this year, sedans made up 33.3 percent of new-vehicle sales and are down 12 percent versus the same period in 2017.
Jack Hollis, Toyota's North American head of sales and marketing, said the automaker expects by the end of 2018 sedans will make up around 30 percent of sales.
Last summer, Honda launched its all-new Accord, arguing that the well-reviewed sedan would help it maintain sales levels in a declining market. Instead, sales of the new Accord dropped nearly 16 percent in February from a year ago. Honda said that between April and June it will halt production at its Marysville, Ohio, plant for 11 days to reduce a high inventory of unsold vehicles.
Nissan executives at the New York auto show on Wednesday said the new Altima has a chance to buck the trend.
""I think we’re going to have a hell of a lot of conquests in the segment,"" Denis Le Vot, who took over running Nissan's North American operations earlier this year, told Reuters. ""Not only from competing models, but also the whole market."" 
Nissan has added all-wheel drive, automatic rear braking and some autonomous features that help drivers stay in their lane or remain a set distance behind the vehicle in front to make the revamped Altima more attractive to consumers.
Le Vot said automakers will have to add more features to remain competitive in the sedan segment. ""Do we put more things in the car? Yes, because the market and the value of the market is going to that.""
Rivals are shifting investments to trucks and sport utility vehicles. Intensifying competition among automakers to sell sedans should lead to higher discounts and narrower profits, said car-shopping website Autotrader's executive publisher, Brian Moody.
""That's good news if you want to buy a sedan because you should be able to get a good deal,"" Moody said. 
Johan de Nysschen, head of General Motors Co's (N:GM) luxury Cadillac division, reiterated plans to cut the number of sedans in its family of vehicles and add sport utility vehicles and crossovers to its lineup.
""Just as we are rebalancing our portfolio and reducing our number of sedan entries, so I imagine others will be doing the same,"" de Nysschen said on Wednesday. ""The market just won't sustain that many derivatives anymore.""
The three big Japanese automakers, however, have large U.S. factories dedicated to midsized sedans such as the Altima, Camry and Accord.
Toyota's Hollis said Toyota remains committed to sedans.
""We're not pulling anything back, we will continue to invest,"" he said. ""If other players want to pull out, fine, we'll just take more market share.""
Nissan's Le Vot said the U.S. midsize sedan segment should stabilize at around 1.6 million units annually.

""This is a very big playground and we have enough room in this playground to play with our car.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are thinking about negotiating your university-bound child's financial aid offers, you had better start working on your pitch.
So many parents are calling up colleges now since the money packages hit their mailboxes this week that the strategy has lost some of its bite. As a result, college financing experts are amending some of the standard recommendations.
""Twenty years ago, only a small number did any appeal,"" said San Diego financial aid consultant Deborah Fox. ""But now people have heard they can negotiate and parents think that no matter what their children get, it should be more. There is a sense of entitlement.""
With the final tab for private college running more than $70,000 a year and public universities close to $35,000, a great deal of money is at stake. 
Grants knock off an average of $6,000 per year off state university sticker prices and $20,000 at private colleges, according to a 2017 report by the College Board.
Incoming freshmen have until May 1 to accept or reject a college's offer. If you want to increase your share of aid, here is how to hone your message: 
* Know where you stand
To better your case, first review the school's website and other resources you can find on how much the college typically provides in aid based on your family's financial needs and on a student's merit. Also know the ""expected family contribution"" from your federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. (https://fafsa.ed.gov)
Note that pressing for need-based assistance can be more valuable to your family than awards based on your kid's achievements. Merit aid may be for only the first year or it could be dependent upon maintaining a high GPA. 
On the other hand, if your finances do not improve but college costs rise, you may get more aid down the road. 
* Document your case
The tax return and FAFSA you sent colleges back in October may be out of date by now. If you have had a financial change resulting from a health issue or a job loss, you could present a change of circumstance. 
Typically, you must document financial issues with paperwork and submit it in a formal process. For example, if you have lost your job you would submit a letter or termination. For medical issues, you might submit medical bills and perhaps a diagnosis to show an illness will continue and demand heavy spending or missed employment during the next school year.
Mistakes also happen, but can be corrected. 
Kalman Chany, financial aid consultant and author of “Paying for College Without Going Broke,"" helped a divorced woman show she had originally filled out the FAFSA incorrectly and had failed to show she was entirely responsible for living expenses.
Fox also helped a woman whose daughter was offered no aid at her first choice, but much more aid at others. Turns out, the first school simply forget to tell her about a $20,000-a-year award.
* Work the yield
Colleges are businesses driven by the need to fill seats and bolster their status among competing colleges in rankings such as from U.S. News and World Report, said Chany. 
If your first-choice school is one that needs to boost the ratio of accepted students who actually attend, it might be swayed to boost aid with a promise to attend, said financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz.
Some college guides report this ""acceptance rate"" statistic outright, or it is blended into the methodology of college rankings. 
The key to this line of negotiation: have an offer from an equally prestigious college, noted Kantrowitz. 
* Play hard to get
Parents who act too eager may convince a college that their child will attend regardless of money. So while you are looking over the aid packages, take a pause.
""Wait a week after the financial aid offer arrives before calling,"" Chany said. 
When you get started with the financial aid office, keep it short and ask about the procedure to appeal – a formal process in which you write a short letter about the financial issue and provide documentation.
The number one tip: avoid a sales pitch about your child. 

""They want to vomit when they hear your child will make a great contribution,"" Chany said.

The withdrawals, during the week ended March 21, came as the prospect of a trade clash between the United States and China shook investors, and just one week after U.S.-based domestic equity funds took in $19 billion, the most cash in nine months.
President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports drove fears about the impact on the global economy. Stocks have continued selling off in the days since.
""I'm seriously worried the market could give back even more,"" said Linda Zhang, chief executive of Purview Investments LLC. ""The trade rhetoric is very, very troubling.""
Markets have been whipsawed in a give-and-take this year marked by shifts from excitement over signs of economic growth to hand-wringing over higher inflation, yields and the prospect that the technology giants will be more heavily regulated. Just earlier this month, tech funds took in the most money since the year 2000's mania. 
U.S. mutual and exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors retained their taste for international stocks, with world equity funds raking in $3.3 billion in a streak of weekly inflows unbroken in more than a year, according to the ICI, a trade group.
Bond funds, meanwhile, attracted $5.3 billion. Commodity funds, including those that invest directly in safe-haven gold, pulled in $938 million, the most cash in six weeks, ICI said.

In addition to the fast-money equity trading, the March 15 to March 21 fund data were influenced by unusual trading patterns as investors unwound positions in futures and options contracts that expired simultaneously, a phenomenon known as ""quadruple-witching.""

982,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:32PM ET</span>",CME Group Is in Advanced Talks to Acquire NEX for $5.4 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Futures trading giant CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) proposed to buy Michael Spencer’s NEX Group Plc for an equity value of about 3.8 billion pounds ($5.4 billion).
NEX said it received a non-binding proposal for the acquisition at 10 pounds per share, according to a statement Wednesday. The talks are at an advanced stage and a deal may not be reached, the company said. Shares of NEX jumped as much as 11 percent after Bloomberg News reported the talks.
Acquiring NEX, which runs markets for trading currencies and Treasuries, would complement the Chicago-based company’s operations as CME offers derivatives on many of the same things. CME Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy has built a powerhouse in part through takeovers, including deals for the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange.
Potential bidders such as  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc and IHS Markit Ltd. may approach NEX with their own offers now that CME has shown its hand. Interest could also come from Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG or Singapore Exchange Ltd., according to Marcus Barnard, an analyst at Numis Securities.
The offer is 49 percent higher than London-based NEX’s closing price on March 15, before the approach was reported by Bloomberg News. CME’s stock rose 0.1 percent to $159.21 at 12:42 p.m. in New York on Wednesday. NEX climbed 9.8 percent to 972 pence in London.
NEX dominates electronic Treasury trading. Its fixed-income division is home to about 80 percent of trading volumes in a $14.5 trillion market. CME enjoys a near-monopoly over trading of Treasury futures. Putting cash and derivatives trading under the same roof at CME would save major banks millions of dollars a year by enabling them to set aside less collateral.

It’s a similar story in foreign exchange markets. NEX’s platforms for trading currencies are among the world’s biggest, while CME oversees massive volumes in futures on euros, pounds, yen and others.
The deal would be Duffy’s biggest since he bought Nymex Holdings Inc. in 2008. Shares of CME have more than tripled since 2011 as the company has benefited from increased volume in derivatives trading.
NEX shares have advanced more than 30 percent since Bloomberg broke the news of the talks on March 15, boosting its market value to more than 3.7 billion pounds and cementing Spencer’s position as a billionaire.
Wednesday’s rally increases Spencer’s fortune by 55 million pounds, pushing the 62-year-old French wine devotee’s net worth to 1.03 billion pounds. It’s quite a turnaround for a man who five years ago was only worth 389 million pounds, according to calculations by Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Spencer owns about 16 percent of NEX and 1 percent of TP ICAP (LON:NXGN), the company that bought the ICAP name at the end of 2016.

NEX’s roots date back more than 30 years to a brokerage called Intercapital, founded by Spencer. That firm eventually grew to become the world’s biggest broker of deals between banks. The former Conservative Party treasurer sold a part of his company and the ICAP name to Tullett Prebon for $1.6 billion at the end of 2016, leaving NEX focused on electronic trading and post-trade services.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:17AM ET</span>",FANG stocks' bite has U.S. fund managers looking for alternatives,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund managers have begun to ditch so-called FANG stocks that powered the U.S. stock market to record highs in January and are slowly rotating into commodity-related shares and other value stocks which typically outperform in late-cycle recoveries. 
Portfolio managers holding shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) say they are increasingly concerned that the data scandal that has sent shares of Facebook down nearly 15 percent year-to-date will spill over into all of the FANG stocks, imperiling the broad market's momentum at a time when there are no clear companies or sectors to take their place. 
On Tuesday, an index which tracks the FANG stocks along with six other mega-cap technology stocks tumbled 6.3 percent, the biggest decline since September 2014. 
Facebook rose as much as 1.5 percent in early trading Wednesday before falling into the red, one day after sources told Reuters that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before Congress. Amazon.com dropped 4 percent, while Netflix fell 5 percent. Google-parent Alphabet was slightly positive.
""There are legitimate concerns over the business models of these companies, and I expect that they will be ironed out in legislation"" that will likely eat into their profit margins, said Michael Cuggino, a portfolio manager of the $17-billion Permanent Portfolio funds. 
Cuggino, who would not say whether he was selling any of his shares in Facebook, said that commodity and industrial stocks look more attractive now given rising inflation and continued global economic growth. 
Each FANG company rose more than 33 percent last year, helping power the S&P 500 (SPX) to a nearly 20-percent gain. Yet those gains have left the broad S&P 500 trading at a high trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7, leaving it overpriced despite a boost to margins from the Republican-led corporate tax cut at the end of 2017.
""Rising volatility and changing market leadership are now pointing towards the possible conclusion that the stock market peaked in late January 2018,"" said Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Capital Management. 
The S&P 500 is now down 2.2 percent for the year, and down nearly 10 percent below the high of 2872.87 it reached on Jan. 26.
UNFRIENDED
Fund managers say that the high valuation of FANG stocks and the likelihood of regulation are pushing them into traditional value stocks like energy and defense companies.
Connor Browne, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said that he sold his shares of Netflix and Amazon.com last year after both companies blew through his price targets. He used those gains instead to increase positions in energy stocks such as pipeline operator  Enterprise Products Partners LP  (N:EPD) and crude oil shipping company  Overseas Shipholding Group  Inc (N:OSG) that stand to benefit from the recovery in the price of oil. 
""We noticed that in all of this excitement over the FANGs taking over the world, there are parts of the economy that seem really out of favor and offer more compelling opportunities,"" he said. 
Even after the selloff, FANG stocks continue to trade at higher valuations than the broad market. Netflix trades at a P/E of 210 and Amazon.com trades at a P/E of 327. Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet, both of which have been directly linked with privacy concerns, now trade at valuations near 52-week lows.
The overhang of increased government oversight has sunk the fortunes of large technology companies in the past.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) reached a settlement in an antitrust case with the Department of Justice in 2002 that lasted until 2011, contributing to a long period of underperformance that kept the stock below the high it reached in 1999 until 2016. Since then, the stock is up nearly 60 percent on the strength of its cloud-based services.
Margaret Patel, a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds, said that she has been adding to defense stocks like  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) that should benefit from increasing military spending in both the U.S. and overseas. At the same time, she is increasing her exposure of non-FANG technology stocks like Adobe Systems Inc (O:ADBE) and Microsoft that have been hurt by the recent sell-off in the sector. 

""It's very hard to see another sector that still has all the fundamental drivers for growing much faster than any other sector,"" she said.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:44PM ET</span>",CEO says committed to Deutsche Bank amid reports of successor search ‍​,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - John Cryan, the chief executive of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said in a memo to staff on Wednesday he was ""absolutely committed"" to the lender, a day after Reuters and other news organizations reported the bank was searching for a new boss.
Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Germany's flagship bank had begun looking for a new CEO, as investors grow frustrated with the slow turnaround of the loss-making lender.
""Once again we are the subject of widespread rumours,"" Cryan said in the memo, posted on the bank's website. ""I just wanted to reaffirm that I am absolutely committed to serving our bank and to continuing down the path on which we started some three years ago.""
In his memo, Cryan said earnings ""have so far not been what all of us would want them to be,"" but that the bank needed to stay on task.
""We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards. There is no difference of opinion here,"" he said.
The sources told Reuters that Paul Achleitner, chairman of the board, had initiated the search to replace Cryan, the British CEO who has been in office less than three years.
Cryan cited in the memo the recent initial public offering of the bank's asset management unit as ""the obvious and most illustrative recent example of a key milestone of success.""

Cryan has been criticized for falling behind in cutting costs. Deutsche Bank is conducting a global review of its investment bank that could result in cost cuts, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

Currently a company taking over a another firm has to acquire 95 percent of its shares and voting rights before its offer becomes obligatory for minority shareholders.
The lower squeeze-out threshold would bring France more in line with other European countries. It is one among a series of measures in a new wide-ranging corporate law being drafted that aims in part at making it easier for companies to raise capital.
With initial public offerings down by nearly half over the last decade, the government also wants to make it easier for small and mid-sized companies to sell shares on equities market.

The law, which is due to go to parliament in early May, would allow companies with annual revenues of less than eight million euros to file simplified IPO documentation rather than a full-blown prospectus.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>",Amazon shares fall after report Trump wants to curb its power,"By Jeff Mason and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) shares fell almost 5 percent on Wednesday, wiping more than $30 billion off its market value, after news website Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is obsessed with the world's largest online retailer and wants to rein in its growing power. 
Trump has talked about using antitrust law to ""go after"" the company because he is worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business by Amazon, Axios reported, citing five sources it said had discussed the issue with him. 
Trump also wants to change Amazon's tax treatment, the Axios report said, an issue the president raised publicly last year when he called for an internet tax for online retailers, even though Amazon already collects sales tax on items it sells direct to customers. 
""The president has said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field for all businesses and this is no different,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, when asked about the Axios report. ""He's always going to look at different ways, but there aren't any specific policies on the table at this time."" 
Trump has been complaining about Amazon in private, believing the company has become too powerful, another administration official confirmed to Reuters.
The official said Trump links this to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos’ private ownership of the Washington Post, which he has called ""fake news"" for its critical coverage of his administration. Trump regards the newspaper as a mouthpiece for Bezos' business interests, calling it #AmazonWashingtonPost on Twitter.
Amazon did not reply to a request for comment on the Axios report.
FAVORITE TARGET 
Trump has criticized Amazon over taxes and jobs in the past, without offering evidence. The president urging the use of antitrust law to selectively thwart a company would be unprecedented, according to Jeffrey Jacobovitz of the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory LLP. 
Amazon's stock, which fell as low as $1,386.17 on Wednesday, was last down 4.6 percent at $1,427.83. The shares have nearly quadrupled over the last three years.
Tech stocks have been under pressure after  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) acknowledged this month that user data had been improperly harvested by a consultancy.

""With Facebook and regulatory worries, the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see was news that Trump is targeting Bezos and Amazon over the coming months as this remains a lingering cloud over the stock and heightens the risk profile in the eyes of the Street,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Reckitt Benckiser CEO gets second pay cut in two years,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB) chief executive Rakesh Kapoor got an 18 percent pay cut in 2017, his second in two years, due to a halving of his long-term incentive benefits, after a year of underperformance at the British consumer goods company.
The maker of Durex condoms and Lysol cleaners said on Wednesday Kapoor received total compensation of 12.5 million pounds ($17.7 million) in 2017, down from 15.3 million in 2016. Without the reduction in his long-term incentive plan (LTIP), Kapoor's 2017 compensation would have been 23.7 million pounds. 
Kapoor's 2016 package had been slashed by a third, after a damaging safety scandal in South Korea, following a measure of investor dissatisfaction with 2015 compensation of 25.5 million pounds that made him Britain's third-highest paid boss. That package was rejected by 18 percent of voting shareholders.
The reduction in the 2017 LTIP, which accounts for the biggest portion of compensation, was volunteered by Kapoor and exercised by the board ""based on the committee's evaluation of performance in the round and alignment of pay outcomes with the shareholder experience,"" the company said. 
""We recognized that 2017 was a challenging year,"" said Mary Harris, chair of the remuneration committee.
For years, Reckitt enjoyed a reputation as a pace-setter of growth in the consumer goods industry. But sales growth evaporated last year, due to a slowdown in its core consumer health business and pressure on pricing, as well as a series of one-time items including a cyber attack, a failed product launch and the scandal in South Korea.
Reckitt's shares ended 2017 roughly in line with where they started it, despite rising to a record high in June, the same month the company closed its $17 billion takeover of baby formula maker Mead Johnson. They have lost more than a quarter of their value so far this year, even after a rally last week. 
At 12.5 million pounds, Kapoor is still likely to be at the upper end of the British CEO pay scale. According to the High Pay Centre think tank, the average CEO pay at a FTSE 100 company was 4.5 million pounds ($6.4 million) in 2016. Figures for 2017 have not yet been calculated. 
Reckitt's market capitalization is 59 billion pounds ($83.6 billion), making it the 15th biggest company in the blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) index.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>","U.S. upbeat about fast NAFTA deal, Canada says much work is left","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday expressed optimism that talks to modify NAFTA could be wrapped up quickly, but a top Canadian official was more downbeat, saying much work remained.
The United States wants to hasten the slow pace of negotiations on the $1.2 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement, citing a need to finish before a July 1 presidential election in Mexico.
""I think we are making progress. I think that all three parties want to move forward, we have a short window, because of elections and things beyond our control,"" Lighthizer told CNBC television.
""But if there's a real effort made to try to close out and to compromise ... I'm optimistic that we can get something done in principle in the next little bit,"" he said.
But chief Canadian negotiator Steve Verheul told reporters, ""We've got quite a bit of work do yet,"" and noted that Washington had not yet explained what it meant by an agreement in principle.
Officials from the three countries are due to meet in the United States next month for the eighth round of talks.
Only six of the roughly 30 chapters have been closed and wide differences remain on topics such as dispute resolution and how much North American content should be contained in autos produced in the three NAFTA nations, a file that Verheul said was still far from settled.
But Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland later told reporters by phone she was ""truly heartened"" by some of the progress made on the autos question.
The United States last week dropped its insistence that all autos made in the three NAFTA countries have 50 percent U.S. content.
That said, Canada and Mexico are still wrestling with a separate U.S. demand that autos produced in the three member nations contain 85 percent NAFTA content, up from 62.5 percent now.
""We don't have a deal yet but we are working really, really hard,"" said Freeland, who did not answer directly when asked about the merits of a deal in principle.
Verheul said there were ""obviously some significant gaps on many issues,"" citing the U.S. positions on dispute settlement, government procurement and a sunset clause that would allow one party to quit NAFTA after five years. 

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week said a deal was likely while stressing the challenges posed by the Mexican vote and U.S. congressional elections in November.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares fell sharply again on Wednesday, reeling from a credit downgrade of the electric car maker by Moody's Investors Service, federal probes of a fatal crash and concerns about Model 3 production.
Shares tumbled 9 percent before ending down 7.7 percent at $257.78. On Tuesday, Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent to its lowest close in almost a year after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a field investigation into a fatal crash and vehicle fire in California on March 23.
On Wednesday, a second federal regulator, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), said it was sending a team to California to investigate the crash.
Late on Tuesday, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s credit rating to B3 from B2, citing ""the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company’s Model 3 electric vehicle.” It also noted “liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.” 
Tesla has $230 million in convertible bonds maturing in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019.
Moody’s said its negative outlook “reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.” 
It said Tesla's weekly production target is now 2,500 Model 3 vehicles by the end of March, down sharply from its year-earlier target of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017. Tesla's weekly target for the end of June is 5,000.
Tesla declined to comment on the downgrade. The company plans to provide an update on Model 3 production next week.
Tesla shares have experienced big swings in the past, as worries about losses have vied with enthusiasm for Chief Executive Elon Musk's ambitious plans.
The sell-off has left Tesla's stock market value at $44 billion, below General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's $49 billion. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla has at times had a larger market value than GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales.
Since the end of February, the median analyst price target for Tesla has dipped by $10 to $356, about 37 percent higher than Wednesday's price, according to Thomson Reuters data. Nomura Securities analyst Romit Shah has the highest Tesla price target, $500, or nearly double the current price. All the targets were set before the March 23 crash.
In last week’s accident in which the Tesla struck a highway median, it was unclear if the vehicle’s automated control system called Autopilot was driving, the NTSB and police said.
The 38-year-old driver of the Tesla died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.

Late Tuesday, Tesla said in a blog post it does ""not yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,"" but added that data shows Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged ""roughly 85,000 times ... and there has never been an accident that we know of."" The statement did not say if the crashed vehicle was in Autopilot mode.

(Reuters) - U.S. exchange operator CME Group (O:CME) is in advanced talks to buy Britain's NEX Group (L:NXGN) for about 3.8 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) to create a cross-border trading powerhouse.
NEX, formerly known as ICAP, said on Wednesday that CME Group had made a takeover proposal of 10 pounds per share, a premium of around 3 percent to the stock's closing price. 
Talks with CME - one of the world's biggest exchange groups that owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - are at an advanced stage, NEX Group added in a statement after the market close.
NEX, a financial technology company that matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, said there was no certainty an offer would be made. 
NEX shares closed 9.8 percent higher at 972 pence. 
The stock has risen more than 40 percent over the last two years as market volatility triggered by political surprises - such as the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, fuelled trading on its platforms.
Attempts at blockbuster exchange mergers, such as between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), have hit antitrust buffers in recent years, and buying NEX could be easier for regulators and politicians to accept.
CME Group closed two operations in London last year after they ran up losses of more than $100 million, saying its customers preferred using its U.S. operations.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) has begun adopting a unified global wealth management structure by merging teams responsible for its private banking products.
The world's largest wealth manager said in January it would combine its businesses servicing American and international clients into one global division.
UBS is now combining the regional teams responsible for managing products and services related to alternative investments, investment mandates and partnerships, an internal memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the bank said.
""We are confident that our new set-up will enable us to capture the many new opportunities that our worldwide wealth management business offers,"" Jason Chandler and Christian Wiesendanger, who jointly lead wealth management's Investment Platforms and Solutions (IPS), told UBS employees on Tuesday.
Wiesendanger and Chandler were named global co-heads of IPS a year ago, in a move that presaged the merger of Wealth Management Americas and the separate international Wealth Management unit which took effect in February.
While the North American and international wealth management businesses will maintain distinct business models, with the United States continuing to service clients through a brokerage model, the Swiss-based bank said the unification would better serve ultra-wealthy clients while cutting costs.
By combining IPS reporting lines, UBS hopes to give clients access to its full product suite across wealth management.
Jerry Pascucci — hitherto alternative investments head in America — will lead the global alternatives team offering hedge fund and private market investments, including investments in private equity, real estate and impact investment, with effect from April, according to the memo. 
Roman Berri and Jake Elmhirst will assume responsibility for private markets and hedged strategies respectively out of Zurich and London.
UBS will also align its mandates business under global investment management head Bruno Marxer and expand offerings in the United States through a new American subdivision.

A global partnerships team under Greg Toskos will provide a single contact point for third-party partners as well as the bank's asset management and investment banking divisions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) unveiled a prototype pickup truck at the New York auto show on Wednesday, a vehicle that would fill a gap in the German company's U.S. product lineup in what is one of the most profitable segments of the American market.
The German automaker said the dual-cab, short-bed concept Volkswagen Atlas Tanoak pickup truck could be built off the same platform at its Chattanooga, Tennessee assembly plant, where it builds the Atlas SUV and Passat car.
Volkswagen said it does not currently have production plans for a U.S. pickup but ""is keen to gauge the reactions of buyers and media, since pickup trucks are one of the biggest volume segments in the U.S."" The vehicle could compete with pickups like the Honda Ridgeline, executives said.
“We want to be a relevant player in this market. We want to definitely be a full-line automaker,” said Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of the North American region for the VW, told reporters Tuesday in New York. “We want to be more American.”
Pickups accounted for about 16 percent of U.S. auto sales in 2017 and the best-selling vehicle is Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's F-Series pickup trucks.
VW sells the Amarok pickup truck in Europe and other markets but not in the United States, where it faces a 25 percent import tariff. VW last sold a pickup truck in the United States in the mid-1980s.
The Tanoak, named after a species of tree that is native to the United States' Pacific Coast, is 214.1 inches long, some 15.8 inches longer than the Atlas, which makes it a large midsize pickup by U.S. standards.
Last week, VW announced it plans to invest $340 million to build a new sport utility vehicle in its Tennessee plant as demand surges for larger vehicles.
The vehicle will be a five-passenger SUV that will be branded as part of the company’s Atlas family and go on sale next year. A concept version called the Atlas Cross Sport Concept was unveiled Tuesday night ahead of the auto show. 
The investment announcement is positive news for the U.S. car industry at a time when it is bracing for the impact of higher steel and aluminum tariffs.
VW said in February that 54 percent of its total own-brand volume sales were SUVs - a big shift for a company that for years largely emphasized cars in the United States.
In addition to a seven-passenger Atlas, which went on sale last year, VW unveiled an all-new 2018 Tiguan SUV last year.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 10:27AM ET</span>",Frozen $500 million in Angolan fraud probe came from central bank account with Standard Chartered,"By Stephen Eisenhammer and Lawrence White
LUANDA/LONDON (Reuters) - The $500 million at the center of an alleged fraud involving the son of Angola's former president was transferred out of a  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) account held by Angola's central bank, the British bank told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Angolan prosecutor general's office said on Monday it had charged Jose Filomeno dos Santos, the former president's son, and Valter Filipe da Silva, the former governor of the central bank known as Banco Nacional de Angola, with fraud over the case.
Britain's National Crime Agency said last week that $500 million had been frozen in the UK as part of an investigation into a potential fraud against Angola's central bank and could be returned to the southern African country.
""We are aware that our client, Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA), was the victim of an attempted fraud in Angola which involved the transfer of funds from their Standard Chartered Bank account,"" Standard Chartered said in an emailed response to questions. 
The bank did not respond to a question on how the transaction appeared to bypass security mechanisms.
The Angolan central bank, which has so far made no public statement about the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dos Santos is the highest profile figure charged since President Joao Lourenco succeeded longtime leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos last September pledging to tackle an endemic culture of corruption in the oil-producing country.
Reuters was unable to immediately contact Jose Filomeno dos Santos. He said in a statement circulated in Angolan media on Tuesday that he was cooperating with the investigation and had handed his passports in to the prosecutor general's office. 
Reuters has also been unable to reach Da Silva for comment.
Standard Chartered said it is closely cooperating with Angola's central bank and British law enforcement.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that HSBC (L:HSBA) had frozen a bank account in connection with the alleged fraud. 
The Financial Times, which reported the HSBC bank freeze earlier, said documents purporting to be from Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) were also used in the fraud.
The documents were fake and Credit Suisse was not involved in the transaction, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Britain's National Crime Agency said the funds were frozen after the transaction raised suspicions, without naming the banks involved.
Standard Chartered, which has operations across Asia and Africa, ended its dollar-clearing operations with commercial banks in Angola in Dec. 2015 because it deemed it too risky.
Singapore said last week its central bank had imposed penalties of nearly $5 million on Standard Chartered Bank and Standard Chartered Trust (Singapore) for breaching money laundering rules and terrorism financing safeguards.
HSBC's move to freeze the accounts and work with authorities to return the funds will reinforce the lender's assertion that its efforts to improve financial controls are bearing fruit.
The bank paid $1.9 billion in fines to U.S. authorities in 2012 and agreed to install an independent monitor to improve its anti-money laundering controls, after it was used to launder Mexican cartel drug money.
A five-year period in which the bank faced criminal prosecution if it breached U.S. compliance rules again ended in December.

1028,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 10:19AM ET</span>",Tesla's tumbling stock has made short sellers $1.9 billion in less than a month,"That would be short sellers, or investors betting on Tesla's stock price to fall. They raked in a whopping $749 million on Tuesday alone, as the company's shares plummeted 8.2%, after analysts questioned the company's ability to hit production targets for its Model 3 sedan.
(Note: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has identified the perfect Tesla trade to protect against Model 3 ""production hell,"" which you can read about here.)
Tuesday's decline brought the mark-to-market profit for short sellers to $1.86 billion for the month of March, and their year-to-date haul up to $835 million, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Tesla's stock also felt pressure from the US National Transportation Safety Board's announcement that it's conducting a second investigation into a crash involving one of the company's vehicle. Further, Waymo's newly revealed electric car partnership with Jaguar also put a damper on Tesla trading.
It served as a triple whammy of sorts for Tesla, which fell another 3.5% on Wednesday following a downgrade from rating agency Moody's. It also means more profits for short sellers, assuming they didn't close positions during Tuesday's selloff.
These developments are sure to irk Musk, Tesla's chief executive officer, who has forged a combative relationship over time with those betting against his company's shares. In a Rolling Stone profile from 2017, Musk called Tesla short sellers ""jerks who want us to die"" and described their behavior as ""hurtful.""
It echoed a tweet Musk fired off on June 8 in which he said the group of investors ""want us to die so bad they can taste it."" In early April, after a period of considerable stock strength, the CEO even went as far as to taunt Tesla's detractors, tweeting, ""Stormy weather in Shortville.""
Unfortunately for Musk, his company's share loss on Tuesday makes Tesla the most profitable short in the US market, according to S3 — something that's sure to entice other investors to enter the trade."

The U.S. economy grew at a faster pace than initially thought in the fourth quarter, according to data released on Wednesday. Gross domestic product grew by 2.9%, up from 2.5%, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate.
The data was offset by increased trade worry and concern over increased regulation in the technology sector.
Trade concerns have returned after the Chinese state run Global Times reported that Beijing would soon announce a full list of tariffs on U.S. imports to retaliate to planned U.S. levies.
Increased scrutiny on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over the misuse of user data has also lead to a slump in tech stocks. The Federal Trade Commission on Monday confirmed it is investigating how the social media giant handles user data. Facebook has faced criticism after a third-party app was used to target 50 million users without their knowledge and CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg agreed on Tuesday to testify before Congress over the data leak.

1032,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Trump wants to go after Amazon,"President Donald Trump is ""obsessed"" with  Amazon, a source told the news website Axios, and is eyeing legal means to go after the online retail giant.
According to  the Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, Trump believes Amazon is a negative force for smaller, locally owned retailers and wants to find a way to curtail the company's dominance in online shopping. According to Axios' sources, he is considering a change to Amazon's tax status or a crackdown down through antitrust rules.
The Supreme Court is  already considering a case that could give states more power to collect sales tax on online retailers.
While Amazon already imposes the applicable state sales tax on goods it sells, when a third-party seller uses the platform, it is up to that seller to collect sales tax. Many third-party sellers on Amazon do not collect those taxes.
Trump  hasn't been shy about his distaste for Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, previously tweeting that the retailer is hurting the US Postal Service and attacking Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post.
""Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers,"" Trump tweeted in August. ""Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""
Concern over Amazon's effect on the American retail landscape  is widely held. But Trump's grumblings about the company's relationship with the US Postal Service seem unfounded, given that  much of the USPS' financial woes come from funding mismanagement, pension obligations, and the non-package side of its business.
According to Axios, Trump has also soured on Amazon in part because fellow real-estate developers have complained to Trump that the company is helping to kill off brick-and-mortar retailers and malls.
Axios said the president did not have a clear plan to go after the company yet.
Following the report,  Amazon's stock fell roughly $64 a share, or 4.3%, in premarket trading to $1,433.05 a share."

Begor will start at Equifax on April 16. His base salary would be $1.5 million, according to a filing.
Equifax said in September that hackers had stolen personally identifiable information of U.S., UK and Canadian consumers, including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses driver's license and credit card numbers.
The company projected earlier this month that costs related to the breach could surge by $275 million this year.
Costs have already been weighing on the company's earnings. For the fourth quarter, it recorded expenses, net of insurance recoveries, of $26.5 million related to the breach.

The company had appointed Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. as interim CEO, who will retire from Equifax in early 2019, Equifax said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in March likely rose 0.4 percent from the same month in 2017, breaking a three-month streak of falling sales due to an extra selling weekend versus the previous year, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Wednesday.
The increase, however, also came on the back of increased consumer discounts, which remain at levels that industry analysts say are unsustainable and unhealthy in the long term. 
March U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.61 million units, an increase of nearly 0.4 percent from 1.55 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 15 selling days of March. Automakers, including U.S carmakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), will release March U.S. sales results on April 3.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million units after hitting a record high in 2016. 
Sales are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
""Interest rates are rising as expected and we are looking for a total of four rate hikes in 2018, a headwind making borrowing more expensive and raising monthly payments,"" Jeff Schuster, LMC's senior vice president of forecasting, said in a statement. 
LMC said it expects full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales to hit just under 17 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for March will be 16.9 million vehicles, up slightly from 16.8 million units in March 2017, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, which exclude lower-margin fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to increase about 1.5 percent in March.
The average discount per vehicle in March rose $74 versus the same month in 2017, to $3,849.
Discounts averaged 10.3 percent of manufacturer's recommended sales prices. Experts believe anything over 10 percent hurts vehicle resale values and is unhealthy for automakers.

The consultancies noted that discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 20 of the last 21 months.

Betterment Chief Executive Jon Stein said it is a move to appeal to wealthier clients who keep only a portion of their assets with Betterment, and who have said they would invest more if they could pick and choose what is in their portfolios.
""This is an addition for those clients who know that they need to adjust their portfolios to (compliment investments) they have externally,"" Stein said in a telephone interview.
Stein said the firm would continue to focus on retail investors who choose to invest in the firm's recommended portfolios. That client is typically around the age of 37 and has roughly $40,000 invested with Betterment.
""The vast majority of our clients still make their investments based on our recommendations and our smart defaults,"" said Stein, referring to the firm's signature robo-adviser service.
One of the earliest and largest U.S. robo-adviser startups, Betterment had roughly 270,000 customers and $10 billion in assets under management as of July 2017.
The firm has continued to add services that break out from its original model, including the move last year to add human financial advisors who work alongside the firm's investing algorithms.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's largest carrier Aegean Airlines (AT:AGNr) picked Airbus (PA:AIR) for an order of 42 aircraft worth $5 billion (4 billion euros) to renew its fleet of single-aisle planes and add capacity for future expansion, executives said on Wednesday.
The order is the largest by a Greek carrier and one of the biggest investments by a private Greek company since the country's debt crisis erupted in 2010.
Seeking to reduce maintenance costs, Aegean, a member of the Star Alliance airline group, had been considering the Airbus A320neo or Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX, with its people working on the project for the last 12 months.
""Today is a very important day for Aegean,"" Vice-Chairman Eftychios Vassilakis said during a news conference. ""We confirmed our commitment to improve our competitiveness by signing a deal for an order of up to 42 aircraft.""
It is the third time in 19 years that the carrier is investing in new airplanes, Vassilakis said, ""aiming to offer our passengers the newest and most technologically advanced planes as we remain focused on quality.""
Aegean signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus. It said the agreement included a firm order of 30 aircraft from the A320neo family, with an option of 12 additional jets with new generation engines offering fuel savings of 15 percent.
The agreement was part of a fleet expansion and renewal program expected to take place between 2020 and 2025, Aegean said.
Ten of the 30 jetliners in the firm order will be Airbus A321 neo aircraft - which are part of the A320 family of planes - while the remaining 20 would be the slightly smaller A320 neo jets, an Airbus executive said.
""Airbus offers a choice of powerplant between CFM Leap and Pratt and Whitney engines,"" the executive told Reuters, declining to be named. ""Boeing's 737 Max planes come only with CFM Leap engines.""
Aegean's CEO said the carrier would decide on the type of engine and the mix of planes at a later stage.
""The new airplanes are just the hardware,"" said Aegean's CEO Dimitris Gerogiannis. ""It is our people who make the difference, not the metal.""
Aegean, which flies domestic and international routes, also owns former flag carrier Olympic Airlines, which was privatized in 2013. Most of its current leases need to be replaced between 2019 and 2023.
Last year, Aegean grew full-year net earnings by 87 percent on an improved load factor and higher sales, riding a strong tourism year. In 2017 it flew a total of 13.2 million passengers.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Rate futures volumes surpass Treasuries as market evolves,"By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - Trading volumes in interest rate futures have overtaken those in U.S. Treasuries for the first time and look on track for further growth.
The popularity of futures reflects an evolving market which is drawing in new participants many of whom prefer anonymous, open market trading venues like the CME Group’s (O:CME), which has a near-monopoly on rate futures.
It also demonstrates the impact of regulations that have constrained risk taking by banks, harming liquidity in some bonds, and made trading over-the-counter derivatives more expensive.
Volumes in futures have surged to $398 billion a day from $257 billion in 2010, while Treasury trading volumes have dwindled to $396 billion a day from $442 billion in the same timeframe.
Volatility in Treasuries that sent benchmark 10-year yields to four-year highs last month has helped boost activity.
“CME rates product usage has increased from greater participation of buy-side clients and continuation of deep and consistent liquidity, in an environment when rates volatility has started to increase from very low levels,"" said Agha Mirza, CME’s global head of interest rate products in Chicago.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch' three-month MOVE index <.MERMOVE3M>, which gauges volatility in Treasuries, jumped to 67 in February, the highest in 10 months.
New rules that require more capital to back over-the-counter derivatives are also being phased in, which is driving more investors to futures as an alternative.
“Investors are comparing to futures and seeing where the futures alternative is cheaper,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research and market structure and technology at consultancy Greenwich Associates.
Greenwich estimates that trading in rate futures can be as much as 70 percent cheaper than doing the equivalent trade with a centrally-cleared interest rate swap. A Greenwich survey of dealers and derivatives users found U.S. respondents expected to move 11 percent of swaps trading to futures, while European participants planned to move 17 percent.
GREATER PARTICIPATION
Futures benefit from leverage and from not being held on bank balance sheets. Rate futures are also attracting firms seeking opportunity in fixed income as alternatives to equity strategies.
“As the principal trading world has moved away from equities trading due to a decrease in profit opportunities, fixed income has become a big growth area, particularly in futures markets for a host of reasons,” said McPartland.
The number of firms with large open interest in interest rate futures at the CME rose to a record 2,086 in February, and is up from 1,649 a year earlier. Volumes in the CME’s interest rate futures edged over 100 percent that of Treasuries on March 7, based on a 52-week moving average. That is up from 94 percent a year ago and 58 percent in 2010.
Rate futures account for 33 percent of the CME’s trading and clearing revenues, according to its most recent annual report.
Moves to relax some regulations may reduce the relative advantages of futures, though they are not likely to reverse the trend.
The Federal Reserve is seen as close to easing some of the bank capital requirements. Market participants have blamed a rule known as the supplementary leverage ratio for reducing liquidity in non-benchmark Treasuries known as “off-the-runs.”
“Some of the suggested changes on leverage would make trading-off-the-run Treasuries easier, which would reduce the relative attractiveness of futures,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), which represents the privately traded derivatives industry, has also said it may challenge the capital requirements for swaps because they are more onerous than for futures.
""I think if you were able to get the charges down on swaps people would migrate to swaps because a lot of people prefer swaps to futures,"" said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
To the CME, new regulations compliment capital advantages that already favored the futures contracts.
“All of those became more amplified and one could argue that there has been greater usage of futures,” Mirza said.

Shares of the biggest U.S. drugstore chain operator were up 4 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Rival CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) stock also rose 1 percent.
Walgreens, which has been focusing on its pharmacy business in the face of falling retail sales, added more than 20 million members through its partnership with pharmacy benefit managers such as Minnesota-based Prime Therapeutics.
This helped fill 9.1 percent more prescriptions in the quarter and drive a 5.1 percent rise in pharmacy same-store sales.
The higher number of prescriptions also comes as the United States faced its harshest flu season in decades, with flu-related doctor visits reaching a 20-year high.
Same-store sales at its retail business fell 2.7 percent, missing analysts estimates of a flat growth, according to Evercore analyst Ross Muken. 
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.85 and $6.05 per share from between $5.45 and $5.70 per share. Analysts were estimating $5.78 per share for the year. 
The lift in forecast reflects a $350 million tax benefit for fiscal year 2018, an increase of about $150 million from the company's previous estimate. 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28 from $1.06 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.73 per share. Net sales rose 12 percent to $33.02 billion, helped in part by Walgreen's ongoing takeover of nearly 2,000 Rite Aid (N:RAD) stores.

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.55 per share on revenue of $32.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",Bank of England reassures finance companies on Brexit transition deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Wednesday finance companies operating in Britain will have more time to meet a Brexit deadline, in a move aimed at avoiding a potentially disorderly shift of people and operations across the continent.
Britain and the European Union last week agreed a transition period of 21 months that will follow Britain's departure from the bloc in March 2019 during which companies will have unchanged access to the bloc's markets.
Many banks have said they will not be able to rely on such a political deal as it will not be formally ratified by governments until the autumn and any deal could collapse if there is domestic political upheaval in the months before Britain leaves.
In a letter to banks, the BoE sought to reassure companies that they can rely on the transition period to ease their adjustment to Brexit.
Companies will be able ""to plan that they will be able to continue undertaking these activities during the implementation period in much the same way as now,"" the BoE said.
It remains to be seen if European financial regulators will say that British banks that do business in the bloc can use the transition deal to take more time to get clearance for their operations in the EU.
Stephen Jones, the chief executive of UK Finance, the trade association for banks and finance firms in Britain, said EU regulators must provide similar reassurance. 
""Without similar assurances from EU regulators, UK-based firms serving customers in the EU will be forced to continue implementing costly contingency plans,"" he said.
Currently, banks such as Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) operate in Britain under EU 'passporting' rules which are due to expire when Britain leaves the bloc.
The BoE said the government has committed to introduce legislation to allow firms to continue their activities for a limited period after leaving the EU.
In the unlikely event that the withdrawal deal is not ratified this will provide a back-stop for companies to continue their operations, the BoE said. 

Earlier this month, Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond said once the transition was agreed regulators should tell companies they can rely upon it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower after a rocky session on Wednesday as gains in consumer staples and healthcare were offset by a sharp drop in Amazon shares and a continuing slide in technology stocks.
All three major U.S. indexes ended the day in negative territory following Tuesday's late-session tech-driven sell-off following Monday's rally as traders moved to defensive stocks after recent weeks' heightened volatility.
""People should expect what's happening given the kind of volatility we've seen as well as the fact that we're kind of in a news vacuum prior to quarterly earnings,"" Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, said. ""It's a market that's really looking for the next leadership."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.29 points, or 0.04 percent, to 23,848.42, the S&P 500 lost 7.62 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,605 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.58 points, or 0.85 percent, to 6,949.23.
Online retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down as much as 6.7 percent, losing more than $53 billion in market value after a report that President Donald Trump indicated he wanted to rein in the company. The stock later pared its loses to end the day down 4.4 percent.
Shares of automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slumped 7.7 percent, extending recent losses, following a credit downgrade and news that officials are investigating a fatal crash and fire in California.
Countering those losses were gains for consumer staples, real estate, telecom, and healthcare.
The S&P Energy index posted the biggest loss of the 11 major S&P sectors, ending 1.99 percent lower as crude prices fell after data showed a surprise build in U.S. stocks. 
The markets shrugged off a report from the U.S. Commerce Department that the U.S. economy slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as consumer spending grew at its fastest quarterly pace in three years. GDP expanded at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2017, ahead of the previously reported 2.5 percent. 
Strong economic data could invite a more hawkish approach by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year with respect to further interest rate hikes. 
""I'm not surprised by the economic data,"" said Carlson. ""But the market right now is looking past that from a valuation standpoint."" 
Stocks had jumped earlier in the week as trade war fears ebbed following comments from officials in the United States and China that implied the world's two largest economies would renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances.
China is expected to announce a list of tariffs on U.S. imports in retaliation against the expected tariff proposals from the U.S. on Chinese goods. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.96 billion shares, compared to the 7.36 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's market regulator said on Wednesday it will take steps to make algorithmic trading cheaper for investors, even as it called for stricter monitoring of such trades amid concern about fair access to markets.
The steps will include providing tick by tick data feed to all trading members free of charge and making services for co-location, or servers that are placed at the site of exchanges, more accessible, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said in a release after a board meeting.
In India, algorithmic trading, like elsewhere around the world, is becoming a bigger part of daily trading, prompting regulators to question whether investors with no access to the rapid form of trading are at a disadvantage.
The SEBI also tightened the penalty rules by narrowing the range of algo orders to 0.75 percent of the last traded price compared to one percent earlier.
It also ensured strict monitoring of such trades by asking stock exchanges to allot a unique identifier to ""each algorithm approved and each order generated"" to establish ""an audit trail"".
In late 2016, the SEBI proposed potential limits on so-called algo traders, including ""speed bumps"" to randomly delay execution of some orders, and forcing exchanges to take orders from co-located servers and other sources alternatively, removing another advantage enjoyed by high-frequency trading platforms.
The SEBI on Wednesday also announced a slew of measures geared towards enhancing corporate governance, including expanding the eligibility criteria for independent directors and mandating additional company disclosures, including more details on auditing firms.

The latest bout of risk-off moves in global markets has arrived just as investors prepare to close out the month and quarter. That leaves many with a conundrum: just how much of the current tumult is down to shifting fundamentals, and how much to portfolio rebalancing that usually accompanies the quarter end?
The conclusion could be key to everything from the fate of the epic bull market in stocks and the chances of a bear market in bonds to the path charted by the greenback. It’s particularly important to short-term money market rates, which had been grinding higher as the U.S. raises benchmark borrowing costs and the era of easy money nears its end.
“Markets have been volatile on alternating headlines and systematic flows in an illiquid trading environment,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists including Marko Kolanovic wrote in note. “While a number of narratives have come out to attempt to explain the recent market weakness, we believe these risks shouldn’t derail the larger positive fundamental forces.”
Indeed, fewer players had the chance to exert larger-than-normal downward pressure as the holiday-shortened week sapped the market of its usual trading activity. Over the past eight years when U.S. stocks dropped more than 1 percent, volume on the U.S. tape has hit 8.6 billion trades on average. Tuesday’s session, however, fell about 1 billion short of that norm, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Still U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which had been locked above 2.8 percent for almost two months, finally fell below that threshold late in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Eurodollars advanced by five to seven basis points, while expectations for more Federal Reserve hikes faded.
Month-end buying in fixed income did squeeze shorts into the close, according to Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed-income at NatAlliance Securities in New York. Yet that may not be the end of declines in bond yields.
Considering everything from lower trending economic data to fading rate hike expectations, it’s likely 10-year yields “get an acceleration through to 2.65-ish” percent before getting to 3 percent, he wrote in a Tuesday note.
One sign that rebalancing is at work: The yen was falling against the dollar on Wednesday, belying its usual status as a safe haven in times of trouble. For Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) AG, it’s a reason not to over-read the current moves.
“These markets are all sound and fury,” he said in a tweet. “Simply looking for yesterday’s sell-off to continue today is as silly as expecting the Monday rally to continue yesterday.”
Beyond the usual quarter-end portfolio tinkering, however, fundamental issues could still weigh on sentiment. Though growth remains strong, the peak in corporate earnings has passed -- and what remains in its place is an era of uneven global expansion, political uncertainty and a shift in market regime, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
“As this unusually synchronized phase ends expect volatility and correlation to rise,” wrote the firm’s global quantitative strategy team, headed by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins. “This does not make us bearish, but reduces the upside from here.”
Meanwhile in equities, Tuesday’s declines would appear to be about news rather than portfolio rebalancing. The S&P 500 Index was higher in the middle of the day before a steady stream of negative tech stories dragged some of the biggest companies lower. Even the Nasdaq 100 Index started Tuesday in the green; it ended the day with the biggest drop since February’s rout.
U.S. stock futures, including contracts for the Nasdaq, turned positive on Wednesday as tech fears began to ease, while the yen slumped. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell, however, hovering around 2.77 percent.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","With Datsun brand, Nissan has another go at Pakistan market","TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) on Wednesday said it would resume building and selling cars in Pakistan next year, becoming the latest global automaker to operate in a market tipped to expand in coming years as vehicle ownership increases among a growing middle class.
The Japanese automaker said it would start producing its entry-level Datsun brand at a plant in Karachi owned by partner Ghandhara Nissan Ltd (KA:GHLT), which will invest 4.5 billion Pakistani rupees ($39.00 million) to upgrade facilities after Nissan ended local production in 2010.
Nissan joins automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), along with  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in announcing increased presence in Pakistan after the government in 2016 introduced policies to promote growth in the auto industry, dominated for decades by Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267).
With a population of nearly 200 million people and growing, Pakistan is a market with big growth potential, posting annual sales of 200,000 cars in 2017, up 60 percent from 2014. That compared with sales of over 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighboring India, which has a population of 1.3 billion.
""There's a big population and the level of (car ownership) is low. It's a good-sized market which is growing,"" said Peyman Kargar, a senior vice president at Nissan who heads operations in Africa, the Middle East and India, adding that the country's annual sales were likely to grow to 300,000 by 2022.
The Ghandhara Nissan plant, which has an annual capacity of 6,000 vehicles, would produce ""several (Datsun) models based on the same platform to optimize the investment"", Kargar said, declining to name specific models.
In neighboring India, Nissan markets its Datsun Go series of compact hatchbacks and people-carriers, while it launched its new Cross compact crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV) in Indonesia earlier this year.
It will contribute technical assistance in the upgrade, while the automaker will also assess and assist local components makers in supplying parts. Kargar said he hoped local parts would initially comprise around 20 percent of vehicles, increasing afterwards. 
Comprising 6 percent of global sales, Africa, the Middle East and India is a growth area for Nissan, and Kargar said he expected to double the region's contribution to overall sales by 2022.
Nissan's bet on Datsun to succeed in Pakistan comes as increasing sales of the entry-level brand has been a bright spot in India, a highly competitive market where the automaker's market share has eased to around 1.6 percent due to sluggish demand for its marquee Sunny sedan and its SUVs. In the 11 months to February, Nissan posted an 8 percent fall in overall Indian vehicle sales.

(Reuters) - Hamburg's tax office is examining the German activities of U.S. agricultural merchant Archer Daniels Midland over a five-year period in what the company called a routine audit, although sources said ADM could face unforeseen liabilities.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the audit had been complicated by the departure of several senior trading officials from ADM's German operations in previous years, of whom some had been made redundant through restructuring. 
Due to a resulting lack of staff with the experience needed to field the authorities' questions, ADM could have to pay more tax on billions of dollars of turnover, they added.
""This should have been a routine tax enquiry. The problem is they don’t have the people with the institutional memory necessary to answer the questions being asked by the tax authorities,"" one of the sources said.
Chicago-based ADM, which buys, stores and ships crops and byproducts, is one of the world's biggest grain merchants. 
Since 2014 the group has stepped up efforts to restructure European operations and focus more on its European headquarters in Rolle, Switzerland, scaling down its previously more prominent German HQ in Hamburg, the sources said.
Around 200 staff – estimated to account for half of the German office - had left the company in recent years, they said. 
Both sources said the audit included the use of futures and options by the German office in emissions, coal and electricity markets as well as its grains and freight desks. 
The first source added that the probe also included derivatives trades on the Chicago Board of Trade that were undertaken by ADM's German office.
""Usually it is no problem squaring the hedges with the exposure of the physical trades. That squaring is normally done at the end of each trading day. For an audit you need the people involved in those trades to be there to explain,"" the source said. 
""But the traders and managers and back office people who could explain that relationship are no longer there. There is a tremendous amount of turnover that has to be explained.""
ADM's revenue from its German office reached $6.4 billion in 2010, $6.2 billion in 2011, $9.6 billion in 2012, $10 billion in 2013, $7.1 billion in 2014 and then dropped sharply to $3.4 billion in 2015, $2.3 billion in 2016 and $2.1 billion in 2017, ADM annual filings showed. 
Data for 2010 and 2011 covered the financial years ending June 30. The revenue data for 2012 to 2017 was for the years ending Dec. 31. ADM was meant to have paid a standard corporate tax rate of 25 percent in the five-year period, but both sources said it had paid low taxes as a result of carrying forward trading losses and writing off other costs against tax. 
""The taxable result could be higher if the hedges made through the futures markets cannot be shown to relate to physical trades,"" the source said. 
""If that relationship cannot be proven, then losses incurred on the futures market may not be tax-deductible."" 
Both sources said it was unclear at this stage how much additional tax - if any - ADM could face. 
A spokesman for the Hamburg city government’s finance department said no information on the case would be released as this area was covered by Germany’s tax confidentiality laws. 
ADM said in a statement the Hamburg tax office for large enterprises was conducting ""a routine tax audit of ADM’s businesses in Germany for the (financial year) period 2010 through 2014"". 
""This is a normal audit procedure in Germany, in which corporate tax audits are conducted in intervals of four to five years. ADM is thoroughly fulfilling all requests of the audit, and, to date, no conclusions have been drawn."" 
ADM added that the audit was ""not specific to certain areas of our business"". Both sources said there was no indication of impropriety or market manipulation, nor was the tax authority looking into any such activity.
The audit is focusing on any potential underreporting of tax ""and the period includes the Toepfer and Wild Flavors acquisitions"", the second source said.
ADM took an 80 percent stake in German trading house Alfred C. Toepfer International in 2002 and bought the rest of the company in 2014. Also in 2014, it acquired Swiss-German natural ingredients company Wild Flavors. 
DOWNSIZING
Germany accounted for 10.4 percent of ADM's revenue in 2010, 7.7 percent in 2011, 10.6 percent in 2012, and 11.2 percent in 2013, then it dropped to 8.8 percent in 2014, 5.1 percent in 2015, 3.8 percent in 2016 and 3.4 percent in 2017, according to annual reports.
""Hamburg has basically been downsized from a global corporate headquarters to a country office and a lot of the traders did not go to Switzerland,"" said a former ADM trader familiar with the Hamburg office, referring to the restructuring.
""There would be great difficulty in answering questions about trades five to ten years ago as so many people have left, both front office and back office. I think that would make it difficult even to answer routine tax inquiries."" 
Chinese food commodities group COFCO's trading division COFCO International has also seen staff upheavals in the past year with the loss of experienced senior traders who were part of Nidera, which COFCO acquired in 2014.
ADM is one of a quartet of merchants alongside Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus - nicknamed the ABCDs after their initials - that has dominated trade in agricultural goods for decades. 
ADM has been trying to invest in lucrative areas such as natural flavorings and food ingredients to boost earnings in volatile commodity markets and raise margins, hit by low prices.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters in January that ADM had proposed a takeover of Bunge, which could set up a bidding war with Swiss-based rival  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's largest drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) is considering a bid for London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP) that could top $40 billion and spark another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry. 
Takeda said on Wednesday it was ""at a preliminary and exploratory stage"" of considering a bid, sending Shire's shares up as much as 26 percent. They were 17 percent higher at 1215 GMT, valuing the group at 32.7 billion pounds ($46.3 billion).
Shire sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. Takeda said buying it could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boosting its position in the United States, oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience.
The drugs industry has seen a surge in dealmaking as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. 
In recent months, Sanofi (PA:SASY) beat  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) in the race for Belgian biotech company  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX), while U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) bagged cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics . 
The prospect of a bid for Shire, 57 percent of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for a takeover battle. 
""Takeda publicly saying it is considering an approach for Shire inevitably means that other big pharma players including AbbVie, Novartis,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) et al will equally be running the numbers with a very high likelihood of leading to a competitive M&A multi-bidder situation,"" said Michael Wegener, managing partner at hedge fund Case Equity Partners, which has a stake in Shire.
Takeda said it had not approached Shire's board. Under UK takeover rules, it has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid.
Shire said it noted Takeda's statement, and confirmed it had not received an approach.
Shire has been under pressure in the last year, with its shares down 24 percent, due to greater competition from generic drugs and a debt pile that stems from its biggest ever deal, the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.
The company announced in January a plan to split into two separate businesses to boost performance.
FRENCH CEO
Takeda, Japan's largest drugmaker by sales, focuses its research on developing treatments for cancer and diseases of the digestive and nervous systems.
It has made no secret of its ambition to become a more global company through acquisitions, although buying Shire would be the boldest move yet by its French CEO Christophe Weber.
""Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda's disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established,"" Takeda said in a statement.
""Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria.""
The statement came after Takeda's shares had closed 1.9 percent lower on the Tokyo stock exchange.
""An acquisition would likely have to include a considerable quantum of equity,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a research note. ""As such, it remains to be seen as to if/how a transaction could be structured or whether today's news will stimulate other potential acquirers in to action.""
Weber, a former GSK executive, was appointed CEO in April 2015 and has already done a number of deals. 
In January, Takeda agreed to buy Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV (BR:G9U) for 520 million euros, funding the deal with cash on hand, and last year, it bought U.S. cancer drug specialist Ariad for $5.2 billion. Takeda's overseas deals mirror those by other Japanese companies, which are facing bleak prospects at home as a rapidly shrinking population weighs on domestic demand.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's auto-to-steel giant Hyundai Motor Group will streamline its complex ownership structure, as it responds to calls from the government and investors to reform the country's powerful family-controlled conglomerates or chaebol.
 Hyundai Mobis  Co Ltd (KS:012330), a key affiliate, will spin off its module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with another group affiliate,  Hyundai Glovis  (KS:086280).
Parent Hyundai Motor Group's Chairman Chung Mong-koo and his son Chung Eui-sun, who is vice chairman, will then buy stakes in Mobis held by other affiliates Kia Motors (KS:000270), Glovis and  Hyundai Steel  (KS:004020).
The various deals are aimed at resolving the group's circular shareholdings, which critics have long said give too much power to Hyundai's controlling Chung family at the expense of shareholders.
Hyundai, South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate after Samsung (KS:005930), is the latest chaebol to step up corporate governance amid pressure from the administration of President Moon Jae-in, which has pledged to reform the powerful businesses in the wake of a corruption scandal involving Samsung.
The restructuring also comes as Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and affiliated parts makers struggle with dwindling profits and sales in major markets such as China and the United States, in part due to a delayed response to the burgeoning sport utility market and Seoul's diplomatic row with Beijing last year. 
""Upon such business restructuring, the Group's corporate governance will become more streamlined,"" the group said in a statement on Wednesday.
South Korea's antitrust chief Kim Sang-jo told Reuters in August he had been in talks with Hyundai Motor Group about overhauling its circular ownership structure. 
The Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that ""Hyundai Motor Group's efforts to improve governance structure to respond to the market's demand is positive.""
Shares of Hyundai affiliates jumped across the board on expectations of an imminent restructuring on Wednesday. Hyundai Mobis rose 6.7 percent and Hyundai Glovis (KS:086280) climbed 10.2 percent ahead of the announcement. 
Shares in Kia Motors also ended up 3.9 percent, outperforming the wider market's (KS11) 1.3 percent fall.
HEIR APPARENT 
Under the proposed plan, Mobis shareholders will receive 0.61 new share of Glovis stock for each share of Mobis. 
Mobis will continue to operate its auto parts-making businesses, focusing on autonomous driving and connectivity and ""aggressively pursue equity investments and acquisitions,"" the group said.
A company source told Reuters the change will result in Mobis being at the top of Hyundai's ownership structure - with chairman Chung becoming the biggest shareholder and the vice chairman, the second-biggest, with a 15-16 percent stake and 14 percent stake, respectively, based on current stock prices.
The deal will allow the younger Chung to secure a stake in Mobis, as he is groomed to take over the family-run empire from his father Chung. 
The spin-off merger is subject to approval at the general shareholders' meetings of Mobis and Glovis, scheduled for May 29. 
The two Chungs plan to raise additional capital to acquire shares of Mobis through the sale of shares in Glovis or by way of other means.
President Moon took office in May, in the wake of a graft scandal that led to the ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, as well as the arrest of the chief of Samsung Group (SAGR.UL), Jay Y. Lee. 
Moon pledged to improve corporate governance and curb the power of the chaebols that dominate Asia's fourth-biggest economy. He appointed Kim, nicknamed the ""chaebol sniper"" for his shareholder activist campaigns of the past two decades, to head the country's antitrust watchdog.
At the heart of the governance conundrum are the interlocking shareholdings among group companies held by their founding families, which mean that if one affiliate goes insolvent, another affiliate will often be forced to come to the rescue.
It has been cited as a major factor behind the so-called ""Korea Discount"" - meaning their shares are typically undervalued in comparison to global peers.

In Hyundai's case, Chairman Chung holds a 6.96 percent in the parts affiliate Hyundai Mobis, which owns 20.78 percent of Hyundai Motor. South Korea's top automaker then controls 33.88 percent of the second-ranked Kia Motors, which in turn owns 16.88 percent of Hyundai Mobis.

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Singapore lowers bar for proposed dual-class share listings,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore stock exchange plans to allow firms with an expected market capitalization of S$300 million ($229 million) to list with dual-class shares, versus an earlier proposed minimum of S$500 million, a move that could give the city-state an edge over rival Hong Kong. 
The new proposal, which is in line with requirements for mainboard listings, was seen to be sufficient in public consultation, Singapore Exchange Ltd said, as it looks to get ahead in the race to become the first Asian bourse to offer a structure aimed at attracting tech firms.
Hong Kong has proposed that applicants wanting to do dual-class shares listings, which allow one set of shareholders greater voting rights than others, should have a market cap of not less than HK$10 billion ($1.27 billion).
Dual-class shares are popular with owners of new technology companies, with the extra voting power given to top executives seen as protection against pressure for short-term returns.
Their introduction in Asia would put the region on a more even footing with New York, which has managed to attract more Chinese tech initial public offerings via the structure.
""There were suggestions that we should look to introduce a minimum market capitalization to attract only bigger companies but subsequent to that proposal we have received more feedback from more respondents who then suggested that there is no necessity for an additional requirement,"" said Michael Tang, head of listing and product admission at SGX. 
The SGX aims to have its final rules issued by the end of the second quarter and the first listing shortly thereafter. 
The exchange said there was broad support for the structure in last year's consultation, and it was now seeking feedback on proposed safeguards to address certain investor risks in a consultation open to April 27.
Dual-class shares have been criticized by corporate governance activists, who have warned that the structure could be abused by company insiders.
SGX has proposed safeguards including limiting initial holders of so-called 'multi-vote' shares to only directors in the company, and limiting each multi-vote share to carry a maximum of 10 votes.

1094,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Treasuries Finally Give in to Tech Turmoil as 10-Year Below 2.8%,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond bulls just sent a friend request to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The turmoil around the social media company -- and technology stocks in general -- has forced 10-year Treasury yields out of a 20-basis-point range that’s held since early February. The benchmark dropped as much as three basis points Wednesday to 2.74 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 6, following an eight basis-point drop Tuesday. The yield has broken below the key 50-day moving average for the first time since mid-December.
For those caught off-guard by the extent of the bond rally, the shift is “still not alarming but definitely worth watching current rates if equities can’t find their way home,” Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial Capital Markets, wrote Tuesday in a note. “As various tech and social media stories continue to get pummeled on a regular basis, however, trading at 2.805 percent and below is gaining ground.”
Treasuries traders are watching for any sign that this year could be déjà vu from 2017, when expectations for higher yields were dashed by March. Last year, it was disappointment over inflation misses and the Trump administration’s inability to make progress on its fiscal agenda.
Now it might just be tech stocks. The market’s darlings just logged their worst day in years, with Facebook extending its worst quarterly slide since 2012.
To read more about the rout in tech stocks, click here.
What’s more, positioning in Treasuries signals a shakeout could be in the offing.
As of last week, hedge funds and other large speculators had a net short position in 10-year Treasury futures that was the close to the most extreme in a year. A break of technical levels like moving averages could shift momentum and lead them to cover their bets to protect from further losses.
BMO Capital Markets strategists, who earlier this month said they’re comfortable wagering that yields already peaked for 2018, see 2.671 percent -- an intraday yield high from late January -- as the next level in sight for the 10-year maturity. It may pause at 2.752 percent, they said.
It’s not just the 10-year maturity grappling with re-pricing. Eurodollars advanced by as much as five basis points on Wednesday, while the overnight index swap market is now pricing in less than two Federal Reserve rate hikes for the remainder of the year.
And to add to the bullish momentum, on Tuesday traders bought 25,000 call options on five-year Treasuries, targeting a move toward 2.5 percent ahead of expiration on April 20, from over 2.6 percent at the time.
It might be too early to call for a revival of the bond bull market. But at the very least, yields may be busting out of their range amid the latest equities tumult.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 06:24AM ET</span>",Brexit and the City: Tracking the fortunes of London's financial districts,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Is London's position as the largest international center of finance slipping as a result of Brexit?
London has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the world for centuries. The financial services sector accounts for about 12 percent of Britain’s economic output, employs about 1.1 million people and pays more taxes than any other industry.
From its traditional City heartland to the brash Canary Wharf skyscrapers and plush Mayfair townhouses, London represents one of the greatest concentrations of financial wealth on earth.
Its only rival, New York, is centered on American markets, while London has more banks than any other hub, dominates markets such as global foreign exchange and commercial insurance and is home to international bond trading and fund management.
But about a third of the transactions on its exchanges and in its trading rooms involve clients in the European Union. These may be jeopardized after Brexit unless Britain manages to maintain similar levels of access to the trading bloc.
The French finance minister predicts Paris will overtake London as Europe's most important financial center in a few years, although supporters of leaving the EU say Britain will benefit over the long term by setting its own rules.
London remained top of the rankings in the annual Global Financial Centres Index released this week by Z/Yen Partners and the China Development Institute, although the gap between it and New York in second closed to one point on a scale of 1,000 and its rating rose by less than the other four top centers.
Reuters is publishing its second Brexit tracker, monitoring six indicators to help assess the City's fortunes, taking a regular check on its pulse through public transport usage, bar and restaurant openings, commercial property prices and jobs.
Almost a year before Britain is due to leave the EU, the tracker suggests London's financial districts have been held back, but there is no evidence of a mass exodus.
""London has not come close to taking a mortal blow or anything like it ... The increasing uncertainty though over London’s future has led to a stall in its growth,"" Michael Mainelli, Executive Chairman of Z/Yen, told Reuters. 
(Graphic: Brexit and the City - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zzQOfC)
Jobs leaving London?
Firms employing the bulk of UK-based workers in international finance told Reuters that the number of finance jobs they plan to shift out of Britain or create overseas by March 2019 due to Brexit has dropped to 5,000, half the figure six months ago.
This comes amid more conciliatory signals from British Prime Minister Theresa May, while progress in talks with the EU have prompted some companies to delay large staff moves.
The findings suggest that the first wave of job losses may be at the lower end of initial industry estimates, meaning London will keep its place as the continent's top finance center in the short term.
London's finance industry should emerge largely unscathed from Brexit even if thousands of jobs move, the City of London's political leader Catherine McGuinness says, adding that it could take years to feel the full impact of Brexit.
""All the signs are that companies are just making plans to move the minimum necessary,"" she told Reuters, adding ""just because you can't see a massive change suddenly happening you can't assume everything is okay.""
Hiring numbers
The number of available jobs in London's financial services industry fell the most in six years in 2017, said recruitment agency Morgan McKinley which hires staff in finance.
It bases its number on the overall volume of mandates it receives to find jobs and applies a multiplier based on its market share of London's finance industry.
The recruiter found 82,147 new financial services jobs were created last year, a 12.45 percent drop on a year earlier. This is the lowest number of jobs available since 2011.
""Brexit has stalled the growth of jobs. Companies are reluctant to make major investment decisions at the moment,"" said Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, which carried out the survey. 
Commercial property
Reuters obtained property data from Savills and Knight Frank, two of the biggest real estate firms in Britain. Savills calculates the value from all-known property deals within the City of London area. 
Savills says commercial property prices in the City of London are now at the highest level since the third quarter of 2016, three months after the Brexit vote, driven by a surge in office purchasing and leasing in the final quarter of 2017.
The price of renting real estate in the City of London district rose 9.5 percent in the last three months of the year, climbing to 78 pounds ($107) per square foot, from 71.21 pounds in the third quarter of 2017, Savills says.
""There has been a lot of exaggeration about the demise of the City,"" Philip Pearce, a director at Savills, said. ""The expectation post-Brexit was the world would start draining away from the City, whereas the reverse has happened."" 
In Canary Wharf, prices were also unchanged in 2017 compared with the year before, Knight Frank, whose data comes from landlords, developers and agents, says.
Going Underground
Some 400,000 journeys are recorded every day at the three main underground stations that serve the City and Canary Wharf.
Reuters filed Freedom of Information Act requests to Transport for London, to get this data which shows that the number of people using Bank and Monument stations is on course for its first fall since the final year of the financial crisis.
Travelers going in and out of Bank and Monument fell by a fifth in 2017 compared with 2016, the data shows. This follows an annual increase each year since 2009.
In Canary Wharf, the number of people using the station fell by 10 percent, while the number of people using London's underground network fell about 2 percent overall last year.
Mike Brown, the commissioner for Transport for London, said it is struggling to explain the drop in passenger numbers.
""Is it an element of economic uncertainty? Is it a handful of jobs here or there maybe not being there this year, compared to last year, or is it actually just that people are working from home?"" he said. ""It is a bit difficult to be categoric.""
Canary Wharf's owners did not respond to requests for comment. 
City Airport
The number of passengers using London City Airport, a popular gateway for finance executives, fell for the first time since the final year of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis in 2017, its publicly available figures show.
The number of passengers at the airport, close to Canary Wharf's financial district, fell 0.2 percent last year. That compares with an average annual 8.8 percent increase in the previous six years.
London City Airport said the stagnating numbers were partly caused by some airlines cutting routes.
""We are very confident about the long term future prospect of London City Airport and aviation in the UK, with passenger growth expected to resume in 2018,"" a spokesman said.
Bar and restaurant openings 
Reuters filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the City of London Corporation to find the number of new premises which have applied for licenses to sell alcohol and license renewals.
The number of venues, such as bars and restaurants, with licenses to sell alcohol in the City of London in 2017 fell 1.6 percent, data from the municipal local authority shows.
The number of venues applying for new licenses was flat compared with 2016, the data shows, although the City of London Corporation said such fluctuations were normal.
""As some establishments close and others open, it is inevitable that licensing renewal figures will fall and rise but overall, the number of licensed premises in the City has steadily increased in recent years,"" it said in a statement.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 05:46AM ET</span>",European shares feel force of tech stock sell-off,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - Technology companies led European stocks lower on Wednesday on persistent concerns over a regulatory crackdown and falls in major tech stocks overnight.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index was down 1.1 percent by 0909 GMT, with tech (SX8P) leading the fallers, down 2.5 percent, after shares in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell further on continued privacy concerns.
A further fall in bond yields also put pressure on the heavyweight banking sector. 
Shares in electric car maker Tesla (O:TSLA) fell on Tuesday after a fatal crash and fire prompted a U.S. federal field investigation, while Twitter (N:TWTR) tumbled after short-seller Citron Research called it ""most vulnerable"" to privacy rules.
Meanwhile, chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) suspended self-driving car tests, a week after an Uber  autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman in Arizona.
Tech was a key driver behind a rally to record highs in global equity markets and investors are concerned that an increase in regulation could spark a further sell-off.
""A recent stream of negative news has acted as a trigger for the sell-off in the U.S. tech sector. But the underlying cause... is extremely stretched valuation metrics that have generated a sizeable misalignment with fundamentals, mostly for the big technology stocks,"" said UniCredit in a note. 
On a price to earnings basis, European and U.S. technology stocks are valued around their highest level in more than a decade. European tech stocks have fallen 9.5 percent from their end-2017 peak but remain among the best sectoral performers in the region over the last year, up 2.5 percent. 
Top fallers among European tech stocks were chipmakers ams (S:AMS), STMicro (MI:STM) and Infineon (DE:IFXGn).
""As concerns semiconductors, the fear comes from the environment of bad news that is accumulating around the functioning and testing of autonomous vehicles,"" IG analyst Alexandre Baradez said.
Among banks, big fallers included Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), which all declined by more than 1 percent, after German bond yields fell below 0.5 percent for the first time since early January.
The fall in bond yields helped defensive stocks like utilities with steady dividends outperform.

Europe's utilities index (SX6P) was the only sector in positive territory, up 0.2 percent, led by a 3.1 percent jump in Britain's  United Utilities  (L:UU), which was underpinned by an upgrade to hold from sell by CFRA.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 04:24AM ET</span>","SoftBank Vision Fund, Saudi Arabia to create world's biggest solar power firm","By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Vision Fund will invest in creating the world's biggest solar power project in Saudi Arabia, it said on Tuesday, stepping up its involvement in the kingdom and expanding beyond technology.
The project is expected to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters in New York. That would add to around 400 GW of globally installed solar power capacity and is comparable to the world's total nuclear power capacity of around 390 GW as of the end of 2016.
By investing in solar power, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, can reduce the amount of crude it currently uses to generate power and increase its overseas shipments. The move illustrates the commitment by the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to transform the country's economic status quo. 
The final investment total for the 200 GW of generation, including the solar panels, battery storage and a manufacturing facility for panels in Saudi Arabia, will eventually total around $200 billion, Son said.
The initial phase of the project, for 7.2 GW of solar capacity, will cost $5 billion, with $1 billion coming from SoftBank's Vision Fund and the rest from project financing, he said.
Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to reduce the country's economic dependence on oil, was a good match for the fund's long-term vision for innovation, said Son.
""These two visions have come together to create clean, sustainable, low-cost and productive renewable energy,"" he said. ""The Kingdom has great sunshine, great size of available land, and great engineers...""
Despite being one of the world's sunniest countries, Saudi Arabia generates most of its electricity from oil-fired power plants. 
Saudi's entire installed power capacity is currently around 60 GW. Adding 200 GW would create enormous excess capacity that could be exported to neighbors or used by industry, although the kingdom will still require other forms of power generation for night-time back-up.
Industry estimates say around 300,000 to 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil are burnt for Saudi power generation.
Exporting that oil could increase Saudi's annual oil revenues by between $7 billion and $20 billion, at the current price for benchmark Brent (LCOc1) oil of almost $70 per barrel.
POST-FOSSIL FUEL
""Saudi Arabia is clearly preparing for a post-fossil fuel dependent economy in terms of domestic energy consumption, and this huge bet on renewables would free up a lot of domestic output of oil for exports, while probably saving domestic gas resources as well,"" said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Singapore.
""Up until now, progress in building solar capacity in the kingdom has been very slow, but this deal might give it the kick start it needs. But 200 GW by 2030 though, that's another question,” Kiernan said.
Last May, Softbank said it raised over $93 billion for the Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund with backers including Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Foxconn, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry (TW:2317). 
The Vision Fund has funneled $27.5 billion into 20 tech firms as of the end of December, transforming SoftBank from a Japanese telecoms upstart into one of the world's biggest technology investors. 
The Saudi investment is Softbank's second major global solar project. 
The company has said it will invest up to $20 billion along with Foxconn and Bharti Enterprises in solar projects in India, which has an ambitious target to generate 100 GW of power from solar by 2022. SoftBank estimated the electrification drive could create a requirement for over 150 GW of additional power.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 02:43AM ET</span>",China's largest banks feel wind in their sails as profits rebound,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top lenders are reporting their best profit growth in three years on better net interest margins, with Beijing's crackdown on shadow financing and high leverage expected to further drive recovery this year. 
The strong 2017 results suggest that Beijing has been successful in pushing smaller lenders to cut their exposure to riskier financing practices - in turn helping reduce competition for the state-backed behemoths.
Over the past decade, small and mid-sized banks had been raking in more profits through aggressive lending via shadow-banking channels. But the tide has turned, with core banking emerging as winner from the regulatory clampdown.
""The banks that will do well this year are those that have national franchises, ""safe"" brands, relatively clean balance sheets, competitive products, sticky core deposits and strong credit skills,"" said John Ott, partner with Bain & Company and a leader with its Greater China financial services practice. 
According to analysts, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) (HK:1398) (SS:601398), China's top bank by market capitalization, has produced the biggest earnings ""beat"" so far for 2017. 
""We have a strong macro economic environment, a good (internal) mechanism, and an improving quality foundation for loans,"" ICBC Chairman Yi Huiman said on Tuesday. ""It can be expected that asset quality will continue to improve."" 
HEALTHIER BALANCE SHEET
ICBC (HK:1398) (SS:601398) reported a non-performing loan ratio of 1.55 percent, versus 1.62 percent a year ago.
Analysts noted that the large gap between that ratio and a 1.26 percent ratio for loans more than 90 days overdue - a key point after which troubled loans are considered bad - suggests ICBC had been conservative in its provisioning and could have room to reduce the overall rate further. 
Non-performing loan (NPL) ratios also improved for China's second- and third-largest lenders by assets, China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) (HK:0939) (SS:601939) and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (AgBank) (SS:601288) (HK:1288).
AgBank's NPL ratio fell to 1.81 percent from 2.37 percent, while CCB's ratio slipped from 1.52 percent to 1.49 percent. This compares to an industry-wide level of 1.74 percent.
Banks' balance sheets are also likely to get a boost from a recent relaxation of bad-loan buffer rules. 
Earlier this month, regulators cut the reserves commercial banks must hold against bad loans from 150 percent to as low as 120 percent - the exact rate will be partly dependent on how quickly banks shed their bad loans.
PROFIT COMEBACK
ICBC, AgBank and CCB reported a combined net profit of 724 billion yuan ($115.31 billion), up 4.1 percent on 2016, driven by a return to core lending businesses from fee-based incomes.
All three saw their best annual profit growth since 2015.
At ICBC, 2017 net fee and commission income fell 3.7 percent to 139.6 billion yuan, while at AgBank it fell 19.8 percent to 72.9 billion yuan. Their non-interest income, which includes private wealth management and investment banking fees, made up a lower percentage of their operating revenue. 
The banks' net interest margins, a key measure of profitability for banks' most basic lending business, rose, after years of weakness brought on by successive rate cuts.
Results from Bank of China (HK:3988) (SS:601988) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) (HK:3328) this week are expected to highlight a similar return to strength.
Because bigger banks hold greater deposits - the cheapest form of funding - and are less reliant on borrowing from the wholesale markets than smaller banks, they are better positioned to capitalize on rising market interest rates.

""Net interest margin will stabilize and improve (next year),"" AgBank's vice-president Zhang Keqiu told Reuters on the sidelines of the bank's press conference on Tuesday.

1107,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>","Saudi Arabia, SoftBank Ink Deal on $200 Billion Solar Project","(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia has signed a memorandum of understanding with SoftBank Group Corp. for a $200 billion solar power project in the kingdom, calling it the single largest of its kind in the world.
SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said he envisions the project, which runs the gamut from power generation to panel and equipment manufacturing, as a way to help wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil for electricity, create as many as 100,000 jobs and shave $40 billion off power costs. The total capacity to be built under its umbrella will be 200 gigawatts by 2030, the company said.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is on a three-week tour of the U.S., his first visit since being designated the successor of his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. He and Son signed the memorandum of understanding in New York on Tuesday. The deal deepens SoftBank’s ties with the world’s largest crude exporter and advances the crown prince’s ambition to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy.
“It’s a huge step in human history. It’s bold, risky and we hope we succeed doing that,” Prince Mohammed said late Tuesday night as he left a press briefing at the Plaza Hotel.
“The kingdom has great sunshine, great size of available land and great engineers great labor, but most importantly, the best and greatest vision,” Son told reporters at the briefing.
SoftBank was said to be planning to invest as much as $25 billion in Saudi Arabia over the next three to four years. That’s a boost for Prince Mohammed, who’s been at the forefront of the Vision 2030 campaign to diversify the kingdom’s economy away from oil by that year. SoftBank is said to have aimed to deploy as much as $15 billion in a new city called Neom that Prince Mohammed plans to build on the Red Sea coast.
The Japanese company’s Vision Fund is also said to plan investments of as much as $10 billion in state-controlled Saudi Electricity Co. as part of efforts to diversify the utility into renewables and solar energy, and SoftBank will also have some of its portfolio companies open offices in Neom.
“This fits in with Saudi Arabia’s push to restructure their economy and is not very surprising,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. “What’s not clear is how much will this benefit SoftBank itself.”
The kingdom’s deal-making has quickened as it pursues Prince Mohammed’s diversification goals. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, which has more than $224 billion in assets, spent about $54 billion on investments last year. The sale of about a 5 percent stake in oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is expected to provide more funds for investments.
Prince Mohammed met last week with President Donald Trump, who welcomed him to the White House. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are developing an increasingly close partnership, encompassing everything from isolating Iran to bolstering business ties beyond energy into technology, defense and entertainment, according to top U.S. and Saudi officials.
The prince used his Washington visit to nurture contacts across party lines, meeting with both Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders in Congress. His tour is expected to include stops in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 02:28AM ET</span>","On China trade clash, Wall Street embraces Trump's poker face","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To Wall Street money managers who make bets for a living, U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive stance against China on trade looks like a high-stakes poker hand - but they believe they can play it for all it's worth.
Fears that Trump could set off a trade conflict have roiled Wall Street since March 1, when the president announced plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighboring Canada.
It's been a roller coaster ride, with markets slumping after Trump last Friday moved to impose up to $60 billion in tariffs on some Chinese imports and China declared plans to retaliate with duties of up to $3 billion of U.S. imports even as it urged the United States to ""pull back from the brink.""
China's willingness to negotiate spurred a rebound on Monday, though jitters in the tech sector drove markets back down on Tuesday.
Investors remain concerned about a trade war between the world's two largest economies, but some big players are sanguine about their prospects to make money even as they try and dissect Trump's strategy on trade.
The former celebrity businessman on March 2 tweeted, ""trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" shocking economists who cite evidence that trade wars in the past have been destructive to economies involved.
""Other administrations have gone to trading partners like China and asked for a fairer deal, only to get a cigar put out on their forehead,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""I suspect Trump's bucking of norms is absolutely part of his negotiating tactics.""
Chiavarone and others said they remain confident the S&P 500 will rise significantly this year. 
""So far you are talking about small amounts of tariffs in niche sectors,"" said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. ""For anyone who is looking for an opportunity to enter the market here at better valuations, this is it.""
THE ART OF THE DEAL
""He has shown himself to act aggressively, quickly and unilaterally, and that's brought China to the negotiating table,"" said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer of EventShares exchange traded funds. ""I truly think they are worried about him taking unilateral action and harming China's economy.""
Fears of a trade war, which could hurt U.S. multinationals and dull the benefits of deep corporate tax cuts enacted this year, have helped push the S&P 500 down nearly 4 percent since the end of February.
The Trump administration has demanded that China immediately cut its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion, a position seen by some as an opening tactic in a long negotiation. 
China could respond to U.S. measures with a range of tariffs aimed at U.S. multinationals, or even farmers in rural regions who helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election. 
Trump's bellicose stance with U.S. trade partners reflects a negotiating style outlined in his 1987 book, ""Trump: The Art of the Deal,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. 

""You propose something horrific, and then when you pull back what you want is not as painful as feared,"" Pursche said. ""The problem is the other side isn't dumb. Eventually, they're going to figure that out.""

NXP sold its 40 percent of Suzhou ASEN Semiconductors Co Ltd to Taiwanese venture partner Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc (TW:2311) for $127 million, according to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday. 
The sale could potentially help ease competition concerns by lowering NXP's exposure to the Chinese market as the country's commerce ministry considers Qualcomm's takeover bid.
Qualcomm has received approval from the other eight of nine required regulators to finalize its acquisition.
In January, NXP announced the end date for the transaction was extended to April 25, following multiple prior extensions.
A spokesman for NXP said the transaction was ""part of the usual pruning of NXP's asset portfolio,"" and not related to the acquisition. 
Qualcomm and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Wednesday.
Chinese regulators are considering the deal at a time of heightened trade tension between China and the United States over a proposed U.S. plan to introduce tariffs on imports from China, including in high-tech sectors.

Last month, the U.S. government blocked the acquisition of Qualcomm by Singapore's Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO), citing national security concerns and worries about China gaining the upper-hand in fifth-generation (5G) mobile network technology.

In a statement, the commissioner said that after being notified of its complaint, Facebook responded that it did not have to comply with the body's demand for the information.
The commissioner ""considers it necessary to publicly identify Facebook in order to highlight its demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the law, and to inform the New Zealand public of Facebook's position,"" the statement said.
The commissioner's statement said ""the social media company said the Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have to comply with the Commissioner's request to review the information requested by the complainant.""
The commissioner said its powers beyond demanding information were limited. 
A spokeswoman for Facebook said the company had investigated the complaint but had not been provided enough detail to fully resolve it.
""We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy,"" she said.
""We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad...Instead the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data."" 
Facebook has come into spotlight over the past week over its handling of data from millions of users.
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company's privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in elections.

Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.

The settlement, disclosed in a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, says Uber also agreed to reforms to its system for compensation, reviews and promotions.
According to the filing, the settlement compensates for financial and emotional harm to about 285 women and 135 men of color.
The settlement arises out of two actions filed in October, one in the San Francisco Superior Court and another in the California district court.
On Oct. 24, Roxana del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina, who described themselves as Latina software engineers, filed an action in the Superior Court, followed by another three days later in the district court alleging classwide gender and race discrimination.
The lawsuit said Uber's employee ranking system was ""not based on valid and reliable performance measures"" and favored men and white or Asian employees. As a result they lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, they added.
The lawsuit followed a widely read blog post in February 2017 from another female engineer that described Uber's work environment as one that tolerated and fostered sexual harassment.
The settlement includes regular reporting of demographic data to Uber's workforce and to the court, as well as developing a validated promotion assessment process.

The world’s second-biggest miner on Tuesday agreed to sell its last coal mine, the Kestrel operation in Australia’s Queensland state, for $2.25 billion to private equity firm EMR Capital and Indonesia’s PT Adaro Energy. That follows announcements last week that Rio will offload coal assets to  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc for $1.7 billion in cash and sell an undeveloped project.
Just five years ago it would have been hard to imagine that one of the top miners wouldn’t be digging up the dirtiest fuel, which generates about 40 percent of the world’s electricity. Rio’s coal-free future is in stark contrast to many of its rivals, such as Glencore, the world’s top coal shipper. The commodity is one of BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd.’s main strategies, while  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc has pulled back on plans to sell out.
Rio won a high price for the Kestrel asset -- which mainly produces hard coking coal used in steelmaking -- offering the producer more flexibility to boost shareholder returns and to pursue possible acquisitions, London-based RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said in a note. “Additionally, Rio Tinto will become the only major without coal assets -- certainly helpful for ESG-conscious investors.”
Rio declined 0.3 percent to A$73.96 by 11:49 a.m. in Wednesday trading in Sydney, as BHP Billiton Ltd. fell 0.7 percent.
While many miners are bullish on coal, the fuel has become a flashpoint for a growing movement of investors calling for miners to cut their exposure. For example, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund doesn’t invest in firms that make 30 percent of their sales from coal, while the Church of England sets the limit at 10 percent.
Rio’s decision is aimed at prioritizing iron ore, copper, bauxite and aluminum operations, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said Saturday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Jacques has argued that even a mining firm as large as his has only so much managerial talent and money, and must focus those on more productive assets.

Rio has also been able to sell coal mines for what it sees as good prices, allowing more cash to be returned to shareholders. The sales deliver “exceptional value to our shareholders and will leave our portfolio stronger,” Jacques said in a statement.
The London-based miner has been shedding its Australian coal assets since dismantling its coal division in 2015. Last year, Rio agreed to sell its Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. to China’s Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., before Glencore then bought a stake in the project. Rio has also sold other projects in places from Australia to Mozambique.
Rio’s energy operations, including coal, uranium and other assets, accounted for about 7 percent of revenue last year, down from a peak of 24 percent a decade earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In 2017, the Kestrel mine produced 4.25 million metric tons of hard coking coal and 0.84 million tons of thermal coal. Rio will decide in August whether to use proceeds from the Kestrel sale to fund additional returns to investors, Jacques said in the Saturday interview. The deal is expected to complete in the second half of the year.
Rio’s move to sell its final coal mine leaves the producer “leaner and greener,” UBS Group AG analysts including Sydney-based Glyn Lawcock said in a Wednesday note. There’s scope for Rio to raise a further $3 billion this year with additional sales of aluminum and iron ore assets, according to Lawcock.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks stumbled again on Wednesday, as jitters about a U.S.-China trade war and regulatory crackdown on tech firms such as Facebook (O:FB) left investors facing their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years. 
Europe's main bourses <0#.INDEXE> fell as much as 1 percent in their fifth sell-off in six and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NDX) opened in the red in the United States again, all of which was enough to send traders piling back into the safety of bonds.
German Bunds, seen as Europe's most secure asset due to Berlin's triple-A-rated finances, rallied hard to send 10-year yields back under 0.5 percent for the first time since early January as U.S. Treasuries nudged towards 2.75 percent. 
The rout in stocks came after the tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 (N) on Tuesday. Losses were extended after China's state-run Global Times reported that Beijing would soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports.
Since hitting a record on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The 47-country MSCI global index (MIWD00000PUS) is down 9 percent from its high.
""We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,"" said SEB Investment Management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was last down 0.4 percent having been as far as 1.1 percent in the red early on when the region's tech sector (SX8P) went down 2.6 percent. 
Nasdaq and S&P 500 went south again too in early deals to add to what has already been a $400 billion wipe out for the FAANGs alone since mid-March. 
Tuesday's battering saw the Nasdaq slump almost 3 percent (IXIC) and the broader S&P (SPX) drop 1.7 percent. As well as the Facebook nosedive, Twitter (N:TWTR) fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) slid 4.5 percent. 
Asia (MIAPJ0000PUS) tumbled 1.5 percent overnight, with Japan's Nikkei (N225) ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent (HK:0700) down 4.6 percent. 
Another weak U.S. spot had been Nvidia (O:NVDA), which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber  autonomous vehicle killed a woman.
""There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,"" said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. 
TRADING BLOWS
The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war.
While the market remains highly vulnerable to news headlines like this, reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism.
""It would be in China's interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings.
""The market is still nervous, and there's a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,"" he added.
In the currency market, the dollar get some respite from its recent selloff as revised fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth data slowed less than previously estimated and revealed the biggest gain in consumer spending in three years.
The greenback bounced 106.13 yen having earlier been changing hands at 105.51 yen  which was not far from Monday's 16-1/2-month low of 104.56.
It knocked the euro off a near a six-week high too. The shared currency was back below $1.24 but still on track to post its fifth consecutive quarter of gains. It is up more than 3 percent since the start of January.
Comments on Tuesday by ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny, who said the central bank will probably decide this summer to cull its bond purchases and warned that the ECB must not fall ""behind the curve"", had helped underpin the euro. 
Germany's 10-year Bund yield  hit a two-month low below 0.500 percent though, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield (US10YT=RR) dropped to 2.76 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR) stood at 2.26 percent.
""There's a general rotation from risky assets towards safe haven assets ... with weakened equities and trade war tensions in the general backdrop,"" said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder.
In commodity markets meanwhile, oil prices slipped as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders.
U.S. WTI crude futures (CLc1) dropped 0.8 percent to $64.85 while Brent crude futures (LCOc1) traded 0.7 percent lower at $69.95 per barrel, off Monday's high of $71.05, which was its highest since late January.

Gold eased down from a five-week high to just under $1,340 per ounce.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said late on Tuesday it was proposing to cancel a planned hike in higher ""gas-guzzler"" penalties for automakers whose vehicles fail to meet minimum fuel-economy standards.
NHTSA in July suspended a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties. Automakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually.
Congress ordered federal agencies in 2015 to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA under the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, proposed raising fines for every gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, but delayed the effective date to September 2018.
NHTSA said in a proposed regulation released on Tuesday that it ""tentatively concludes"" that hiking the penalty would have a ""negative economic impact.""
New York, California and three other U.S. states in September sued the federal government for delaying the rollout of the higher penalties as did several environmental groups.
A federal appeals court has set an April 12 hearing on the lawsuit. On Tuesday, two major auto trade associations intervened on behalf of the government in the suit.
In March 2017, Republican President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency standards for 2022-25 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough.
The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to determine by Friday that the standards are ""not appropriate"" and propose revisions to the rules in the coming months.
NHTSA said previously the increases would potentially result in an additional $30 million in annual civil penalties. Automakers say the increases would dramatically raise costs since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits used to meet requirements.
Some automakers including some luxury makers historically have opted to pay fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles, paid the most in fines in recent years.
NHTSA said in July many automakers were falling behind current fuel standards and face ""the possibility of paying larger CAFE penalties over the next several years.""

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major companies, said it was pleased that NHTSA had issued the proposed rule, but will need time to review the ""notice that's just been released before we’re able to offer more.""

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 10:38PM ET</span>","At Time Warner trial, Dish executive says AT&T arbitration offer not sufficient","By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - A proposal AT&T (N:T) made to the U.S. government last year to avoid going to trial over its $85 billion deal to buy  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) would not sufficiently protect competitors, a Dish executive testified on Tuesday.
The U.S. government is seeking to stop the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner's Turner networks, which include CNN, TBS and TNT. 
Tuesday’s testimony was the third day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. that is due to last six to eight weeks. 
AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner's networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration. 
However, such concessions would not address the risks to companies like Dish because the language is vague and it is unclear who would have the expertise to arbitrate, said Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish's Sling TV, in his second day of testimony. 
""It's a high-risk proposition to put your business in the hands of an arbitrator who may or may not understand your business,"" 
Also, HBO was not part of that proposal, which is a huge issue given that one in five of Dish's customers subscribe to HBO, Schlichting said.
On cross examination, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli pointed out that Dish had asked the Justice Department to impose the arbitration arrangement as part of the Time Warner deal.
Under the proposal, the arbitrator would look at comparable services and what they pay for programming at ""fair market value,"" which Schlichting said was too vague.
""My reading is there is nothing preventing them from pushing more networks on us,"" he said, meaning forcing distributors to carry networks they do not want. He noted that Dish's Sling online streaming service tries to keep costs low by offering fewer networks. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon asked Schlichting if Dish has data to prove that certain networks are not popular with viewers. When Schlichting said Dish does have that data but it does not affect negotiations, Judge Leon showed surprise.
Before the trial on Tuesday, the judge held closed talks with attorneys about what testimony Schlichting could give
in open court. 

The U.S. Department of Justice called Turner CEO John Martin as a witness late in the day, and his testimony will continue Wednesday.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 08:24AM ET</span>",Uber’s use of fewer safety sensors prompts questions after Arizona crash,"By Heather Somerville, Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage
TEMPE, Ariz./PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - When Uber decided in 2016 to retire its fleet of self-driving Ford Fusion cars in favor of Volvo sport utility vehicles, it also chose to scale back on one notable piece of technology: the safety sensors used to detect objects in the road. 
That decision resulted in a self-driving vehicle with more blind spots than its own earlier generation of autonomous cars, as well as those of its rivals, according to interviews with five former employees and four industry experts who spoke for the first time about Uber's technology switch.
Driverless cars are supposed to avoid accidents with lidar – which uses laser light pulses to detect hazards on the road - and other sensors such as radar and cameras. The new Uber driverless vehicle is armed with only one roof-mounted lidar sensor compared with seven lidar units on the older Ford Fusion models Uber employed, according to diagrams prepared by Uber. 
In scaling back to a single lidar on the Volvo, Uber introduced a blind zone around the perimeter of the SUV that cannot fully detect pedestrians, according to interviews with former employees and Raj Rajkumar, the head of Carnegie Mellon University's transportation center who has been working on self-driving technology for over a decade. 
(For graphic, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2pJG7kw) 
The lidar system made by Velodyne - one of the top suppliers of sensors for self-driving vehicles - sees objects in a 360-degree circle around the car, but has a narrow vertical range that prevents it from detecting obstacles low to the ground, according to information on Velodyne’s website as well as former employees who operated the Uber SUVs. 
Autonomous vehicles operated by rivals Waymo, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving vehicle unit, have six lidar sensors, while General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's vehicle contains five, according to information from the companies.
Uber declined to comment on its decision to reduce its lidar count. In a statement late Tuesday, an Uber spokeswoman said, ""We believe that technology has the power to make transportation safer than ever before and recognize our responsibility to contribute to safety in our communities. As we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way.""
Uber referred questions on the blind spot to Velodyne. Velodyne acknowledged that with the rooftop lidar there is a roughly three meter blind spot around a vehicle, saying that more sensors are necessary.
""If you're going to avoid pedestrians, you're going to need to have a side lidar to see those pedestrians and avoid them, especially at night,"" Marta Hall, president and chief business development officer at Velodyne, told Reuters.
The safety of Uber's self-driving car program is under intense scrutiny since Elaine Herzberg, 49, was killed last week after an Uber Volvo XC90 SUV operating in autonomous mode struck and killed her while she was jaywalking with her bicycle in Tempe, Arizona.
The precise causes of the Arizona accident are not yet known, and it is unclear how the vehicle's sensors functioned that night or whether the lidar's blind spot played a role. The incident is under investigation by local police and federal safety officials who have offered few details, including whether Uber's decision to scale back its sensors is under review.
Uber has said it is cooperating in the investigation and has pulled all of its autonomous cars off the road, but has provided no further details about the crash.
Like the older Fusion model, Uber's top competitors place multiple, smaller lidar units around the car to augment the central rooftop lidar, a practice experts in the field say provides more complete coverage of the road.
The earlier Fusion test cars used seven lidars, seven radars and 20 cameras. The newer Volvo test vehicles use a single lidar, 10 radars and seven cameras, Uber said.
Since Uber launched a self-driving car program in early 2015, it has hustled to catch up with Waymo, which began working on the technology in 2009. Uber management moved swiftly and confidently even as some car engineers voiced caution, according to former employees, in a rush to get more cars driving more miles.
Seven experts who have reviewed the crash agree that a self-driving system should have seen Herzberg and braked. She had crossed nearly the entire four-lane, empty road before being struck by the front right side of the vehicle. The night was clear and streetlights were lit.
""Radar is supposed to compensate for (the lidar's) blind spot,"" said Rajkumar. 
Uber declined to comment on its radar system. Volvo Car Group, owned by China's Geely, declined to comment. A Ford spokesman said the company was not involved in Uber’s use of the Fusion or the self driving technology employed on the cars. 
To be sure, there are many possible causes of the crash other than the lidar blind spot. There could have been a software failure in the Uber car, said Richard Murray, an engineering professor at California's Institute of Technology and the former head of Caltech's student self-driving team.
""But this would be quite surprising since there was nothing else on the road,"" he said.
THE BLIND ZONE
An Uber diagram of the Fusion model notes that ""front, rear and wing-mounted lidar modules aid in the detection of obstacles in close proximity to the vehicle, as well as smaller ones that can get lost in blind spots."" 
A diagram of its Volvo version shows a single lidar system on the roof. In reducing its lidar units, Uber chose to rely more on radar to detect obstacles that may end up in those blind spots, according to company statements.
At Uber's September 2016 unveiling of its Pittsburgh self-driving car operation, it was still using the Fusions, but had a Volvo on display. Uber staff pointed to the sleekness of the SUV and the relatively small roof mount with only one lidar system, a more attractive upgrade from the Fusion, which had a bulkier look with more sensors attached to the exterior. 
A former employee said Uber justified the decision to slim down to one lidar by saying they ""overdid it"" with the additional sensors on the Fusions, suggesting the multiple lidars were unnecessary as Uber continued to refine its self-driving system.
Uber's decision to move from the Fusion to a much taller vehicle exacerbated the issue of a blind spot from a single lidar unit, said former employees, because the lidar now sits up higher on top of an SUV, further reducing its ability to see low-lying objects - from squirrels to the wheels of a bicycle or a person's legs.
One former Uber employee involved in testing both the Fusions and Volvo SUVs said that during a test run in late 2016, the Volvo failed to see a delivery truck's tailgate lift that extended into the street, and the car nearly hit it going 35 miles-per-hour. 

Uber declined to comment on specific testing incidents, but said its technology is constantly being updated and improved, and every incident in the cars is logged and checked out by an engineer.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","Tesla bonds, stock plunge on probe and downgrade","By Davide Scigliuzzo
NEW YORK (IFR) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its bonds and stocks fall sharply Tuesday on a double-dose of bad news: a downgrade from Moody's and word of an investigation into the fatal crash of one of its vehicles.
The electric car company's outstanding junk bond, a 5.3% 2025 deal that priced in August 2017, hit its lowest-ever level of 89 cents on the dollar, according to data from MarketAxess.
It was already at its previous low of 91 cents in the afternoon before Moody's announced it had lowered Tesla's corporate rating one notch to B3. 
The rating agency cited the ""significant shortfall"" in the production rate of its Model 3 sedan, whose rollout the US$1.8bn bond issue was largely intended to finance.
Moody's warned it could downgrade the company further if Tesla falls behind the updated production targets for the car, and changed the outlook on Tesla to negative from stable.
It also lowered the rating of the junk bond to Caa1, becoming the first agency to push the debt into the lowest rungs of ratings above default.
Moody's said Tesla will need to raise more than US$2bn of capital in the near term to cover its heavy cash burn and US$1.2bn of convertible debt maturities through early 2019.
S&P rates the company B-, a level on a par with the new Moody's B3 rating.
The downgrade hit at the end of a trading session that had seen Tesla's stock fall 8.2% to US$279.18 per share after the National Transportation Safety Board said it would investigate the fatal crash of a Tesla vehicle in California last week.
The stock plunge wiped approximately US$4.2bn off of Tesla's market capitalization.
Tesla stock was trading at more than US$357 per share when the company sold its junk bond last year.
That bond is expected to be the first of several in coming years, as the company switches away from equity issuance to fund its ambitious growth plans.

But it has faced significant delays in scaling up production of its Model 3 electric vehicle.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The co-founder of ride hailing company Lyft Inc said on Tuesday a fatal collision in which an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle struck a pedestrian could have been prevented.
""I don't know all the specifics. I did see the video. It did look like both the tech and the driver could have or should have prevented that. But I don't know all the details,"" Lyft co-founder John Zimmer told a small group of reporters during a visit to Washington.
Elaine Herzberg was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in the evening on March 18 when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling at about 40 miles per hour (65 kph), according to police. The Volvo XC90 SUV was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel. 
The death of the 49-year-old woman has spurred questions about whether more oversight is needed for the nascent industry and prompted Arizona's governor to suspend Uber testing.
Zimmer said it was important not to take shortcuts and put out new technology before it's ready. ""We need to make sure that all players are acting responsibly because, again, the goal is to actually make it a safer opportunity for people,"" he said.
Currently, there are no performance standards or state or federal testing of self-driving vehicles before they are deployed on U.S. roads.
Self-driving vehicles are designed to perform far better than human drivers and reduce the number of vehicle fatalities. Zimmer cited statistics showing that around 100 people per day are killed in vehicle-related accidents in the United States.
""The goal is to take that to zero,"" he said. ""So I worry about -- if it took autonomous (vehicles) one day more because of this, to get to market, that could be 100 people's lives that are at risk."" 
Lyft has been vying for a bigger share of the U.S. ride-hailing market now dominated by Uber, which has been rocked by executive departures after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, bullying and other employee concerns.
Lyft has sought to brand itself as a more socially conscious company.

On Tuesday, San Francisco-based Lyft announced it would begin conducting third-party audits to ensure that workers are paid equally regardless of gender or race.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - U.S. gunmaker Remington Outdoor Co Inc won court approval on Tuesday to borrow an interim $75 million to sustain its business during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which will allow the company to carry out a $775 million debt-cutting deal.
Remington filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, a day after hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets to demand tougher gun laws to prevent school shootings like the one in Parkland, Florida in February that left 17 dead.
The Madison, North Carolina-based gunmaker was nearly out of cash when it filed for bankruptcy, prompting it to seek fresh financing from its lenders.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware said he was convinced the financing was necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the company and its creditors. 
""A lack of disruption is key to preserving value,"" he said in approving the loan.
Remington said its bankruptcy will not impact its customers, suppliers or unsecured creditors, which would include those pursuing lawsuits. Families who lost loved ones in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut have been trying to hold the company liable because one of its assault rifles was used in the attack.
Little was said at the hearing about the student-led push for increased gun control. One of Remington's lawyers, Tyson Lomazow, briefly mentioned that the company was ""operating in a difficult political climate"" during his arguments in support of the company's request for fresh financing.
Remington is borrowing the money from its current lenders.
Sources told Reuters the banks were providing the loans to prevent the company from going out of business, leaving the banks with large losses and potentially spawning litigation. 
Banks often sell loans as a borrower heads into bankruptcy. Sources told Reuters the hedge funds that usually buy such loans were reluctant given the pressure on the industry from gun control advocates after the Florida school shooting, and because the prices offered were not attractive.
Firearms makers have been stuck with a glut of weapons after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he is a strong advocate of gun ownership. Fears of restrictions on gun ownership tends to boost U.S. sales of weapons.

(Reuters) - A federal judge significantly narrowed but refused to dismiss a lawsuit accusing  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the third-largest U.S. bank, of predatory mortgage lending targeting black and Hispanic borrowers in the Chicago area.
U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman ruled on Monday that Illinois' Cook County, which includes Chicago, may pursue federal Fair Housing Act claims against Wells Fargo, to the extent the bank's alleged ""equity stripping"" practices boosted the cost of administering and processing a higher number of foreclosures.
But Feinerman dismissed claims alleging harm from lost property taxes, the need to combat crime and blight, racial segregation and other factors, calling them ""ripples"" that ""flow far beyond"" Wells Fargo's alleged misconduct.
He pointed to a May 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision, involving similar claims by the city of Miami against Wells Fargo and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), allowing cities to pursue FHA claims so long as they could establish a ""direct"" link between the alleged misconduct and the resulting harm.
The lawsuit began in November 2014, nearly two years before San Francisco-based Wells Fargo began facing broad denunciations and a series of probes by regulators and politicians into its opening of unauthorized accounts and treatment of customers.
Cook County accused Wells Fargo of steering minority borrowers into loans they could not afford, resulting in higher fees, defaults and foreclosures than for white borrowers, and rewarding employees with bonuses for offering such loans.
""While the court has allowed the lawsuit to proceed, we are encouraged by the fact that it has significantly limited the scope of the allowable claims,"" Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in an email on Tuesday. ""We are prepared to defend our record as a fair and responsible lender.""
Cook County has a population of about 5.2 million, of whom about 2.7 million live in Chicago. Lawyers for the county did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Other U.S. cities have brought predatory lending cases against major banks, among which are Baltimore, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Louis Vuitton expands French manufacturing to meet handbag demand,"By Sarah White and Pascale Denis
SAINTE-FLORENCE, France (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton, the biggest earnings driver at French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), is expanding its leather goods and handbag production with at least two new workshops planned for this year and next, the brand said on Tuesday.
The label, originally known for its travel trunks, will hire 500 people for two sites in western France, bringing its staff of leather goods specialists to around 4,000 as it looks to meet growing demand.
One site will open by July this year, and another by early 2019. A third new opening should follow later next year, Vuitton's industrial director Emmanuel Mathieu said.
Parent LVMH, also home to labels like Givenchy and Christian Dior, reported record profits and sales in 2017, helped like its peers by the rebounding appetite of Asian shoppers for luxury goods.
Fashion labels derive some of their highest margins from leather goods like handbags and wallets.
Vuitton makes the majority of these items in its home market, echoing rival Hermes (PA:HRMS), which trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is also due to open several new workshops by 2020.
By early 2019 Vuitton will have 16 French leather workshops, the firm said. Its last opening was in 2017, following a lull since 2011, although it had increased staff at its sites in the meantime.
France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialization.
The industrial sector saw its first net job creation since 2001 in the last three months of 2017, national statistics showed this month.
Louis Vuitton, which owns all of its own stores, is also looking to cut lead times to help it react to sales trends, managers said. It aims to deliver handbags within a week of internal orders coming in, down from the current two weeks.
""When we launch a new product we can adapt very quickly to demand,"" Mathieu said at one of Vuitton's existing plants near the village of Sainte-Florence in western France.
Models including Vuitton's Twist bags or the mini Palm Springs backpacks are assembled by hand at the site by some 250 workers trained on specialist stitching machines. 
Vuitton does have several plants elsewhere, however, including two in California to cater to the U.S. market and a new one planned in Texas.
It also has four workshops in the Spanish region of Catalonia, and production facilities in Portugal and Romania where it makes components like luggage handles.

LVMH does not break out earnings for its brands, but analysts estimate Vuitton's sales reached at least 8 billion euros last year.

1135,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 things to watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. US GDP, Pending Home Sales, Trade Data on Tap
Investors will get their clearest indication yet on the underlying strength of the U.S. economy amid GDP and housing data slated for Wednesday.
The final reading of fourth-quarter U.S. GDP is expected to show the rate of economic growth rose to 2.7%, up from the previous reading of 2.5%.
Pending Home Sales, meanwhile, is forecast to show 2.1% growth for February following a 4.7% slump in the prior month.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, is expected to report the trade gap narrowed to $74.10 billion in February from $75.26 billion in the prior month.
The U.S. trade deficit has garnered added investor attention in recent weeks as the U.S. seeks to plug its the trade gap with China. 
The trade deficit with China jumped nearly 17% to $36.0 billion in January, the highest since September 2015.
The dollar clawed back some of its recent losses against its rivals rising 0.37% to 88.98.
2. Rising U.S. Crude Stockpiles to Extend Retreat in Crude Oil Prices?
Weekly inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show crude stockpiles resumed their expansion last week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 287,000 barrels in the week ended March 23. U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly fell by 2.622 million for the week ended March 16.
Crude oil futures settled at lower on Tuesday as the prospect of a build in U.S. supplies offset ongoing bets that rising tensions in the Middle East could lead to a disruption in global crude supplies.
3. Twitter’s Wings About to be Clipped?
The tech wreck on Tuesday was characterised by a tumbled in shares of Twitter following investor fears that the social media company could become embroiled in the data-privacy storm and face regulatory headwinds.
Famed short-seller Citron research said Tuesday that Twitter is the most vulnerable social media company to privacy regulations as it relies heavily on selling user data.
Citron said: “Twitter will generate $400 million this year, by just selling user data, not advertising”. The investment research firm added that the “dynamics are in place to short Twitter” with a price target of $25 on shares of Twitter.
Twitter has long been believed to be an acquisition target but Citron said an acquisition by another party is “far less likely"" until these companies ""clean house with regard to privacy concerns and selling user data”.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) fell more than 12% to close at $28.07 on Wednesday."

On Friday, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler will be in Seattle, with plans to meet Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). CEO Satya Nadella, as well as executives from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., said people familiar with the matter. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will host the 32-year-old prince at his home.
Over the weekend, Prince Mohammed will jet to Los Angeles for potential meetings with representatives of Hollywood studios,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). and Virgin Hyperloop One, a transportation startup backed by Dubai-owned conglomerate DP World Ltd. He’ll be in Silicon Valley late next week, looking to meet with executives from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, Uber Technologies Inc. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.
The prince’s agenda includes a push for Amazon to consider working with Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Energy on building a data center in the country, which would be the first in the Middle East for the world’s largest cloud provider, said one of the people. He wants to explore a plan that would have Alphabet open new offices in Saudi Arabia and provide the state-owned oil giant, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, with cloud services, one of the people said. On Tuesday afternoon in New York, the head of Google’s cloud business signed an agreement with Aramco to establish a national cloud service provider.
The flurry of meetings is part of Prince Mohammed’s first official visit to the U.S. since becoming heir to the throne last year. He has aggressively pushed for investments in tech, including a $3.5 billion deal with Uber in 2016 and the creation of a massive tech fund with SoftBank Group Corp. that’s reshaping the global startup market.
In addition to scouting tech deals on the trip, the prince and his delegation of more than a hundred officials are seeking to burnish the kingdom’s image abroad. The country has faced criticism over the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and a controversial crackdown on corruption that snared the nation’s top businessmen in a temporary jail at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. The prince’s three-week tour of Washington, New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston is focused more on business than politics.
Associating with Saudi Arabia can lead to conflict within the walls of tech companies. The country’s treatment of women is a major point of contention. After Uber took the money from Saudi Arabia and added an official to its board, customers objected to the company for cozying up to a country where women weren’t allowed to drive. Last year, the government agreed to change its stance on that issue.
Developing industries, including technology, is a key part of the prince’s plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and create jobs for its young population. Part of that plan involves loosening more of the kingdom’s social restrictions, including some of those on women. Representatives from the companies on the prince’s agenda all declined to comment.
A major goal is to lure more businesses to Saudi Arabia. Officials have put together proposals for Apple, Snap and others to open offices in the capital city, Riyadh, one of the people said."

The national apartment vacancy rate rose to 4.7 percent in the first quarter from 4.6 percent in the previous quarter, with 49 of 79 metros reporting a rise in vacancy, Reis said.
""The apartment market slowed at the end of 2017 and then remained muted in the first quarter as it frequently does in winter months,"" Reis said in a statement.
The national average asking rents edged 0.9 percent higher and effective rent grew 0.8 percent for the quarter, the Reis report said.
However, net absorption fell 12,054 units to 27,875 units in the first quarter. Construction was also low at 39,917 units, trailing the 2017 quarterly average of 58,824 units.

Reis said many metros are expected to see considerably higher levels of completions in 2018 but expects the increase in vacancy to not exceed 2.5 percent in any market.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>","Nestle, other food groups likely suitors for GSK's Horlicks: sources","By Pamela Barbaglia, Martinne Geller and Ben Hirschler
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Food giants  Nestle  (S:NESN), Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) Horlicks health nutrition business, which could fetch more than $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
GSK has started a strategic review of Horlicks - a malt-based drink brand popular in India – and some of its smaller products, after buying  Novartis  (S:NOVN) out of their consumer healthcare venture for $13 billion on Tuesday.
The main asset on the block is GSK's 72.5 percent stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (NS:GLSM). The sources said the stake was worth $3.1 billion at current market prices but GSK wanted a premium in any sale.
They estimated the consumer health nutrition business, which also has smaller operations in Nigeria and Bangladesh, could fetch more than $4 billion.
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged food company, has previously told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions, the people said.
Nestle already owns the malt drink Milo, but it is not a big-seller in India. The Swiss company declined to comment.
Unilever, the world's largest tea company, and Kraft Heinz, which sells the powdered drinks Crystal Light and Kool-Aid, also declined to comment.
Horlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink. It was introduced to India by Indian soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War.
Associated British Foods (L:ABF), which owns the malt drink brand Ovaltine, could look at the business to scale up in a key emerging market, the sources said, although the size of the GSK business could be a deterrent.
An ABF spokesman declined to comment.
The Indian business has an enterprise value of about 29 times core earnings, said one of the sources, meaning any deal premium will value it well above what many packaged food and drink brands fetch. The valuation is inflated by the high growth rates seen in the Indian market.
Nestle and Unilever could purchase the asset through their local Indian subsidiaries, Nestle India (NS:NEST) or  Hindustan Unilever  (NS:HLL).

Other potential suitors might include Coca-Cola (N:KO), PepsiCo (O:PEP), Suntory (T:2587), Mondelez International (O:MDLZ) and JAB, the coffee business owner that recently agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple, one of the sources said.

(Reuters) - A fatal crash and vehicle fire of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, last week has prompted a federal field investigation, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday, sparking a big selloff in Tesla stock.
Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent, or $25 a share, to close at $279.18, the lowest close in almost a year, after news of the investigation.
Late on Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Tesla's credit rating to B3 from B2. Moody's said the ratings ""reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle."" It also ""faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.""
Tesla shares fell another 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.
Tesla has $230 million in convertible bonds maturing in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019.
Moody's said its negative outlook for Tesla ""reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.""
Moody’s said Tesla is targeting weekly production of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June, down from the company’s year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018. Tesla plans to provide an update on Model 3 production next week.
Shares of chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which supplies Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and other automakers, closed down 7.8 percent after it disclosed it suspended self-driving tests across the globe.
QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCIDENT
In last week's accident, it was unclear if Tesla's automated control system was driving the car. The accident involved two other cars, the NTSB and police said. Tesla vehicles have a system called Autopilot that handles some driving tasks. The 38-year-old Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.
Late Tuesday, Tesla said in a blog post it does ""not yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,"" but added data shows that Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged ""roughly 85,000 times... and there has never been an accident that we know of.""
The company said it is working with authorities to recover the logs from the computer inside the vehicle to try to gain a better understanding of what happened. The company statement did not address if the crashed vehicle was in Autopilot mode.
""We have been deeply saddened by this accident, and we have offered our full cooperation to the authorities as we work to establish the facts of the incident,"" Tesla said in a statement earlier.
Government scrutiny of the Palo Alto, California company is mounting. This is the second NTSB field investigation into a Tesla crash since January.
The California Highway Patrol said the electric-powered Tesla Model X crashed into a freeway divider on Friday and then was hit by a Mazda before colliding with an Audi.
The Tesla's lithium batteries caught fire, and emergency officials consulted company engineers before determining how to extinguish the battery fire and move the vehicle safely. NTSB said the issues being examined include the post-crash fire and removing the vehicle from the scene.
The Tesla blog post said Tesla battery packs are designed to ensure that a battery spreads slowly in the rare circumstance it catches fire.
In January, the NTSB and U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent investigators to California to investigate the crash of a fire truck and a Tesla that apparently was traveling in semi-autonomous mode. The agencies have not disclosed any findings.
The NTSB can make safety recommendations but only NHTSA can order automakers to recall unsafe vehicles or fine automakers if they fail to remedy safety defects in a timely fashion. Before the agency can demand a recall, it must open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken.
Tesla's Autopilot allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods. Still, Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel ""at all times"" before they can use Autopilot.
The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.
In September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash in Florida that killed a driver using Autopilot. That crash raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches but cannot completely replace human drivers.

Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.

Thousands of large UK employers have been ordered to disclose their gender pay gaps by April, almost 50 years on from the passage of Britain's equal pay act.

""We will continue to champion gender equality and look forward to continuing to measure progress,"" he said in a report. 
The data was combined for all of its British legal entities.
Thomson Reuters said men occupied 71 percent of its senior leadership roles.
""The bonus gap is also impacted by the senior leadership profile as these roles attract long term financial incentives which are included in the bonus gap calculations,"" Thomson Reuters said.
At Thomson Reuters Professional UK Limited, the mean pay gap was 2.43 percent while at Reuters Limited the mean pay gap was 20.23 percent. The respective mean bonus gaps were 51 percent and 40.96 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to investing in the U.S. healthcare sector, it has paid off big to bet on smaller stocks.
So far this year, the healthcare sector within the small-cap S&P 600 (SPSMCA) has gained about 14 percent as investors point to a boost from an expected pick-up in deal-making. Those gains far outpace the 1.5 percent decline for the healthcare sector within the S&P 500 (SPXHC), the benchmark for large-cap U.S. companies, as of Monday's close.
While small-cap stocks in general have fared better than large-caps this year, the edge has been slight - with the overall S&P 600 (SPCY) up 0.8 percent versus a 0.6 percent dip for the S&P 500 (SPX).

An expectation for increased acquisitions in healthcare has benefited small stocks, with deal premiums and improved valuations leading to higher share prices, investors say. The anticipation of more consolidation has gained steam as investors began anticipating the federal tax-reform package that paves the way for larger companies to bring back money from overseas.
Healthcare analysts also point to relatively strong innovation among smaller companies as helping their shares, while some investors cite the potential for smaller stocks to be more immune to concerns about regulatory pressures in healthcare.

""A lot of it is all the M&A and consolidation that has been going on. You are seeing it across medical devices, you pretty constantly see it in pharma and biotech, now you are seeing it in large cap deals in the insurance and (pharmacy benefit) side of things,"" said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager focusing on healthcare for Gabelli & Co. ""That has given the big boost.""
Over the past three years, small-cap healthcare has also beaten large-cap - 65 percent to 11.5 percent - with small-cap outperforming large in the four biggest industries: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, equipment and supplies, and providers and services.
The top small-cap healthcare stock gainers this year include diagnostics company Abaxis Inc (O:ABAX), biotech Enanta Pharmaceuticals (O:ENTA) and HealthEquity Inc (O:HQY), which provides health savings accounts.
Among large healthcare companies, shares of biotech firms  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) and Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) have stumbled in 2018 amid product setbacks, along with shares of  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), following its planned purchase of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (O:ESRX). 
The stock price of the largest healthcare company by market value, Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), is down about 9 percent in 2018.
“Big-cap healthcare is generally dominated by major pharma, and they have done nothing ... Same thing with big biotech,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. ""The interesting science has all happened at the small-cap therapeutic level.""
Money flows suggest a small-cap strategy within healthcare gaining favor. The Powershares S&P Smallcap Health Care Portfolio ETF (O:PSCH) has seen its assets grow to $392 million, more than double than at the end of 2016, according to Lipper data. 
While more than $3.8 billion has flowed out of healthcare ETFs and mutual funds this year, $66 million has flowed into the Powershares smallcap ETF, according to Lipper.
Similarly, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (P:XBI), which weights large, mid and small-cap biotech stocks relatively equally, has drawn $276 million in net inflows this year. The Ishares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (O:IBB), which is more heavily weighted to large-cap stocks, has had net outflows of $822 million.
“There’s certainly more innovation in the small-cap space and I don’t think it’s any big secret that the pipelines of the larger companies are kind of looking boring at this point...,"" said Terry Smith, director of life sciences research at Emerald Advisers, a small-cap investment firm in Leola, Pennsylvania. ""So they do need to buy innovation.”
Another factor that could be propelling smaller stocks, including biotechs, is the potential for them to be less in the crosshairs of any concerns over drug pricing, an issue that has clouded the healthcare sector since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, investors said.
Smaller biotech companies typically work on fairly innovative therapies or those that address new markets, said David Heupel, a healthcare analyst for Thrivent Investment Management.

“Typically that is not where we’re so worried about price,” Heupel said. “It’s been more in the areas of, 'I’ve got five diabetes drugs that do the same thing, why are we allowing them to price up 6- to 8-percent every year?'”
Greenwood Capital has an overweight position on healthcare in its small-cap portfolio, but not in its large-cap fund, according to Walter Todd, chief investment officer for the Greenwood, South Carolina, firm.
“We felt like in healthcare you had a lot of opportunity with much less risk than the large-cap space,” Todd said.
To be sure, betting on individual small-cap stocks is still a very risky endeavor. For example, biotech companies banking on one product can see huge share swings on single events.

“It is better to have a basket of them, so if one or two of the pharma or biotech companies fail, it doesn’t ruin the entire portfolio,” Gabelli's Jonas said.

In the latest example of a company misjudging its marketing, Heineken said it was pulling the video ad for Heineken Light from all global markets.
""While we feel the ad is referencing our Heineken Light beer, we missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,"" the company said in a statement.
The video commercial, with the tagline ""Sometimes, Lighter is Better"" showed a bartender sliding a bottle of Heineken Light past a number of people of color, before it reaches a light-skinned woman.
The decision to withdraw followed Twitter comments by Chicago-born Chance the Rapper that gained a wide social media following.
""I think some companies are purposely putting out noticably racist ads so they can get more views.
""I gotta just say tho. The “sometimes lighter is better” Heineken commercial is terribly racist omg,"" the Grammy-winning singer tweeted on Sunday.
The ""Coloring Book"" singer said he was not advocating a boycott, adding ""im just noticing how often it happens.""
Heineken said in its statement that it had a long and ""positive track record for creating marketing that shows there’s more that unites us than divides us.""
It says its Heineken Light beer has just 99 calories.
Several companies have suffered accusations of racism in recent advertising. In January, fashion company H&M apologized for a poster that showed a black child modeling a hoodie that had the words ""coolest monkey in the jungle"" on the front.

Last year, Pepsi pulled an ad featuring American model Kendall Jenner after complaints that it trivialized civil rights protests by Black Lives Matter, and beauty product maker Dove apologized for a video that appeared to show a black woman turning into a white woman after using its soap.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>",U.S. Social Security funding should ease customer-service crisis,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)
By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Need help from the Social Security Administration with your benefits? Be prepared for a long wait.
Years of budget cuts by Congress have left the Social Security Administration (SSA) short of staff on its toll-free customer service line. Long lines form daily outside many local field offices. And the backlog of people waiting for a hearing on disability insurance claims is more than 600 days.
But last week, Congress made a downpayment on a badly needed fix for the customer-service crisis plaguing the agency. Lawmakers ignored the Trump administration's request to hold the SSA budget flat, instead boosting the agency’s administrative budget by $480 million as part of the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending legislation signed into law by the president. 
Few government agencies touch as many lives as the Social Security Administration. In fiscal 2017, the agency paid $990 billion in benefits to 67 million retired or disabled workers, survivors and recipients of Supplemental Security Income. The agency interacts with the public through its network of more than 1,200 field offices, its website and its toll-free teleservice.
Demand for SSA services is rising as the nation ages, with about 1 million new claimants coming on board each year. But budget cuts have forced sharp reductions in staffing and other resources that have damaged the agency’s ability to provide effective, timely public service.
The most serious problem is a historic backlog in appeals by people trying to claim disability benefits. According to agency data, the average wait for a response on an initial SSDI application or “reconsideration” (a form of quick appeal available in 40 states) was 212 days in fiscal 2017, and the average wait for an appeal decision was 605 days. More than 1.1 million people are waiting for a hearing decision.
But the service crisis affects people attempting to transact all manner of business with the SSA. The average waiting time to see a claims agent in the field offices has been rising; waiting times to get help on the SSA’s toll-free number have also ballooned - the average wait is 30 minutes, and callers are on hold for as long as two hours at peak times. Slow processing of paperwork can keep beneficiaries in limbo for months and even years waiting for mistakes to be corrected.
An SSA spokesman declined to comment for this column, saying only that the agency is reviewing the new legislation. 
BUDGET SHRINKS AS ENROLLMENT RISES
The agency’s operating budget has been cut 11 percent from 2010 to 2017 in inflation-adjusted terms; at the same time, the number of beneficiaries rose 13 percent.
The cuts have forced a reduction of 3,200 field office staffers since 2010, according to data from the National Council of Social Security Management Associations (NCSSMA), a membership organization composed of SSA field office and teleservice center managers. The staff losses often have come through attrition as older, more experienced staff depart. More than 60 field offices have closed, and office hours have been reduced.
Against that backdrop, the budget allocation for fiscal 2018 is just a small start in the right direction. The omnibus legislation increases the SSA budget by $480 million over FY 17’s appropriation; $280 million of that is earmarked for badly needed information technology upgrades. Another $100 million is tagged for reducing the disability backlog. Another $100 million is general funding that can be used to improve field office and toll-free teleservice operations.
Advocacy groups welcomed the funding news last week. But they noted that the hole that the SSA needs to climb out of is deep. If the agency’s budget had only kept pace with the Consumer Price Index since fiscal 2010, it would be more than $1 billion higher next year than the $12.1 billion that has just been allocated, said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who tracks the operations of the SSA.
That is a conservative figure, she notes, because the SSA’s costs for big items such as office rent and healthcare tend to rise more quickly than the CPI. “And all of that is figured in before you consider that the number of beneficiaries served is growing by 1 million a year,” she said.
Even the increased funding for disability hearings will not turn things around overnight. Much will depend on how the money is spent, said Lisa Ekman, director of government affairs for the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, a group of attorneys that handles disability cases. “While $100 million sounds like a lot of money, it’s a drop in the bucket in the context of the chronic underfunding of the system that has been going on for years.”

The key question, said Romig, is whether the SSA receives higher funding on a consistent basis in the years ahead. “We didn’t expect Congress to reverse all the damage in a single year, but we will need them to continue to increase SSA’s funding if we want them to meaningfully address the agency’s problems.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to provide support and training to the kingdom's fleet on an upcoming visit to Seattle, the chairman of the state-owned military industrial company said on Tuesday.
Part of an effort to localize 50 percent of its military industry by 2030, Ahmed Al Khateeb of Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) said Saudi Arabia is talking with major U.S. companies about their presence in the kingdom.
""We have been in dialogue with them to expand their business in Saudi Arabia. We will sign an MoU with Boeing in our visit to Seattle,"" Khateeb told Reuters on the sidelines of the 2018 Saudi U.S.-CEO Forum in New York. 
""Hopefully we will be announcing other MoUs with other big American companies,"" said Khateeb, who is also chairman of the General Entertainment Authority. 
Saudi Arabia's crown prince is leading a whistle-stop visit to the United States and on Friday is scheduled to travel to the U.S. West Coast.

The newspaper said no formal decision had been taken about the post although it said the German and French governments, which each own an 11 percent stake in the company, were agreed that the two countries should divide up the two top jobs.
The board of Airbus said last week it would nominate a new CEO at the end of the year to replace German-born Tom Enders. The main internal candidate is Guillaume Faury, the Frenchman who took over as planemaking boss last month. 
Airbus declined to comment. 
The mandate of the current chairman - Denis Ranque - runs until the annual general meeting in 2020.
Obermann, who served as CEO of Deutsche Telekom from 2006 to 2013, is a partner at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.

Handelsblatt said he was seen as an ideal candidate because he has experience running a company with state involvement, noting he also has an excellent reputation in France, where he was awarded a legion of honour.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Wall Street rethinks blockchain projects as euphoria meets reality,"By Anna Irrera and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street has been much more excited about the system underpinning bitcoin than the cryptocurrency itself, but the global financial industry has not yet been able to do much with the technology known as blockchain. 
Reuters has found several blockchain projects launched by major financial institutions that have been shelved, as development of the technology enters a hype-meets-reality phase. 
The casualties include projects by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) and SIX Group, Reuters has found. 
These were among the wave of blockchain tests touted by the financial industry over the past few years, as firms bet the new technology would displace much of the sector's infrastructure, cutting out middlemen, speeding transactions and reducing costs for things like securities and payments processing. 
Yet as some projects were developed, companies pulled back for various reasons - from costs to industry readiness, underscoring that, for all its potential, blockchain is still in its early days. 
DTCC, known as Wall Street's bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. 
The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said.
""Basically, it became a solution in search of a problem,"" he said. 
Post-trade services provider, SIX Securities Services, a unit of the group that operates Switzerland's stock exchange, has also decided not take into production a prototype built by DA for the processing of securities, SIX spokesman Jürg Schneider, told Reuters. 
""We wanted to go into another direction,"" Schneider said. 
The partnership with DA, run by former JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) executive Blythe Masters, was announced in 2016. 
French bank BNP Paribas in 2016 said its securities services division had partnered with startups including SmartAngels to build a platform for private small businesses to manage their securities.
The bank stopped work on the project, and will instead team up with other financial institutions on another blockchain initiative called LiquidShare, said a source familiar with the matter. ""Creating an enterprise-wide robust blockchain platform requires the full cooperation of the whole post trade ecosystem,"" the source said.
PROOFS OF CONCEPT 
The DTCC, BNP Paribas and SIX tests were among a barrage of blockchain ""proofs of concept"" announced with great fanfare by financial institutions.
""A large part of the problem has been expectation management, or rather lack thereof by many vendors and large consultancies that made claims that could not be fulfilled in the time spans they had said on stage at fintech events,"" said Tim Swanson, founder of technology advisory Post Oak Labs.
Reuters reported last week JPMorgan was considering spinning off its marquee blockchain project Quorum. In July a partnership between settlement provider Euroclear and startup Paxos to develop a blockchain service was dissolved.
Still, other projects are moving forward.
Pozmanter said the DTCC is still examining another project with DA and that it is close to testing a blockchain-based trade information warehouse set to launch next year. 
""We're still bullish on the technology,"" Pozmanter said.
The repo test with DA ""met all its stated goals"" and led to a new project that DTCC is examining, said DA spokeswoman Vera Newhouse.
SIX is working on a blockchain project with Nasdaq (O:NDAQ) and Australia's stock exchange ASX Ltd (AX:ASX) said in December that DA will help replace its registry, settlement and clearing system, in one of the most ambitious projects to receive a green light.

1175,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Yo-Yo Market Shows Growing Divide on How to Trade Tariff Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- Looming trade war or empty saber rattling?
How investors answer that question will likely set the tone on U.S. equity markets in coming weeks after a steady drumbeat of headlines from the Trump administration and China sent stocks on the wildest ride in years.
The conundrum was evident early Tuesday, when an overnight rally in S&P 500 futures gave way to a mixed open on the cash market, as the latest news tested Monday’s narrative that any trade war was over before it even began.
At fault were reports that the Trump administration was said to be considering cracking down on Chinese takeovers, while Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross indicated Trump is planning “other action” on trade. Two days earlier, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all but signaled an armistice had been reached, the S&P 500 went on to post its best advance since 2015, and Trump promised that “all will be happy” in the end.
The rapid shift in sentiment is going to be the new normal, at least for a while, according to Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds Inc.
“The bottom line is the trade issue and uncertainty related to that is not going to fade in one day because all of a sudden we started thinking that we would reach some sort of a settlement with China,” he said. “This is going to be somewhat of a long process for things to settle down.”
The knee-jerk reactions are overwrought, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, who said last week’s dizzying selloff following Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods was an “irrational response.” The fundamental impact will be smaller than the market assumed, and the S&P 500 should continue to climb another 13 percent toward his year-end price target of 3,000, he said.
Viktor Shvets, head of Asian strategy at Macquarie, sits somewhat in the middle. He argues that a trade war isn’t looming, but the world is inching toward a more protectionist future that will make assessing investment strategies less straight forward.
“There is a huge difference between an inexorable slide towards de-globalization and an outright trade war,” he wrote in a March 27 note to clients. “The former is inevitable, the latter is unlikely, at least for a while. De-globalization and constraints on capital flows are now not anomalies, but are an integral part of the new investment climate. It implies that it is no longer possible to assess what is ‘safe’.”
The uncertainty is part of the reason  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is advising its clients to scale back their exposure to equity risk. Although trade isn’t the sole reason for the firm’s new “mild underweight” position, a confluence of events has it reassessing the conviction to hold stocks over bonds.
“It seems to us that the most important risks on both sides – sharply higher inflation and much tighter monetary policy, an economic recession, an economically costly ‘trade war’ or geopolitical event, and costly regulatory push-backs in systemically significant industries like tech – all pose larger threats to equities than to bond markets,” analysts, including the firm’s head of macro research Ajay Rajadhyaksha, wrote in a note Tuesday.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",Banks and funds compete for second-lien loans,"By Claire Ruckin
LONDON (LPC) - Banks and funds are competing for second-lien leveraged loans as they battle for higher yielding assets to bolster their returns.
Borrowers renewed their appetite for second-lien loans in 2017 as a means of increasing overall leverage on a deal, while maintaining control over who holds the paper -- something that could not be achieved via the public high-yield market. It also didn't come with restrictive call protection associated with bonds.
However, for the majority of 2017, private equity firms shunned banks to pre-place second-lien loans directly with cash-rich funds, guaranteeing placement on the most expensive and risky part of a capital structure and avoiding any costly risks that could arise during a syndication process.
Yet deeply technical and liquid markets saw banks offer increasingly attractive terms and two large second-lien loans for Dutch-headquartered business services firm TMF Group and UK-based payment processing company Paysafe were syndicated at the end of last year.
Despite some caution from institutional investors, having been burnt on subordinated debt in the financial crisis, many have appetite for second-lien loans as a way of boosting returns, especially when pricing has come down significantly on senior paper.
Second-lien is also more attractive from a yield perspective than bonds, offering average margins of 750bp-775bp, compared to bond yields of 550bp.
""It is arguably a lot safer to take a strip of second-lien on a deal you like than take a higher margin on senior paper in a less credit-worthy deal. CLO investors have subordinated buckets to fill and second-lien is much more attractive than bonds when it comes to yield,"" a senior investor said.
TMF's €200m eight-year second-lien facility closed in December to pay 687.5bp over Euribor, with a 0% floor at 99.5 OID, while Paysafe's US$200m and US$250m-equivalent euro-denominated second-lien loans closed at the end of November to pay 725bp over Libor with a 1% floor and 700bp over Euribor with a 0% floor, respectively, at 99 OID.
""Syndicating second-lien can save 50bp-100bp for a sponsor if it goes well,"" a syndicate head said.
The success of TMF and Paysafe encouraged confidence among sponsors of smaller financings to syndicate second-liens. An €80m second-lien loan backing Citic Capital's buyout of French packaging firm Axilone closed in February to pay 775bp over Euribor, with a 1% floor at 98.
""TMF and paysafe helped smaller syndicated second-lien deals get over the line,"" a second syndicate head said.
MIXING IT UP 
In 2018, however, funds fought back and proved competitive on pricing, preventing a wholesale trend for syndicated second-liens. Now the market is seeing a mix of both syndicated and preplaced second-lien loans.
Funds available to take pre-placed second-lien loans include Alcentra, Apollo Capital Management, MV Credit, Ares, Park Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital, EQT, GSO and Partners Group.
""There is a trade off to be done between a market that has an appetite for second-lien but isn't certain until placed versus someone coming in and doing it in one go to remove any threat of flex or widening,"" the second syndicate head said.
In March German-based wheelchair manufacturer Sunrise Medical and Luxembourg-headquartered investor services firm SGG both preplaced second-lien loans.
""Locking down costs, fixing margins and getting rid of expensive flex by preplacing the most junior pieces of the capital structure to de-risk can be attractive. Yes there might be a slight cost premium but this is compared to a downside of materially more than that,"" a third syndicate head said.
At the same time UK forecourt operator EG Group has wrapped up a second-lien loan and Advent ‘s £1bn public-to-private buyout of listed UK electronics and technology business Laird includes a £100m second-lien facility that is set to be syndicated.
LOSS IN FEES 
After a deliberation process, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice has decided to preplace a £285m second-lien loan, which forms part of a wider £1.75bn-equivalent leveraged loan financing backing Motor Fuel Group's £1.2bn acquisition of MRH, the UK's largest petrol station and convenience retail operator. Syndicating it had been an option.
The preplacement of MFG's second-lien delivered an approximate €5.7m loss in underwriting fees to the banks, based on a 2% fee.
Despite banks losing out on 2%-3% underwriting fees on second-liens, sponsors are having to pay out that same amount to the funds they are preplacing the paper with, in the form of an arrangement fee.
So in order to be competitive, funds need to be cheaper than the margins and flex offered on an underwrite. Flex can see a sponsor on the hook for an additional 150bp.
""Sometimes the downside of underwriting is just too great, other times they make sense, especially for the more well known, larger credits. If the preplaced funds push back and want higher pricing then we may see even more underwrites, there is a natural competition between the two liquidity sources that is keeping them both on their toes,"" the third syndicate head said.

Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad was accused in an indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan of involvement in a scheme to evade U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, U.S. prosecutors said last week. A lawyer for Sadr has declined to comment.
Pilatus Bank's assets have since been frozen by the Malta Financial Service Authority (MFSA) but the case prompted criticism of the island's authorities for inaction. 
Six members of the European Parliament are now calling for the ECB, the euro zone's top banking watchdog, to reconsider Pilatus' banking license and screen the Maltese banking sector for more financial crime. Pilatus has not responded to requests for comment.
""We urge the ECB to assess the adequacy of the measures taken by the MFSA and consider whether these circumstances warrant the withdrawal of the authorization of Pilatus Bank,"" the MEPs said in the letter.
""In addition, we call on the ECB to systematically check whether the business model of other Maltese credit institutions pose risks stemming from financial criminality.""
They asked the ECB to assess ""the independence of the MFSA's regulatory and operational functions"".
The MFSA did not immediately provide comment, but Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said last year the financial services sector is as transparent, solid and compliant as that of any other European jurisdiction.
Malta's police have said the suspected sanctions busting did not involve Maltese citizens or institutions and that no transactions passed through Malta. 
The ECB has been keen to stress it is not responsible for money laundering but its chief supervisor, Daniele Nouy, conceded on Monday that seeing U.S. authorities unearth cases in the euro zone was ""very embarrassing"".

She also called for harmonized EU legislation against money laundering and, possibly, the creation of an agency to enforce them.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Takata whistleblowers to share $1.7 million award, lawyers say","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Three former Takata Corp employees will share an award of $1.7 million after they alerted authorities to the risks of deadly air bag inflators that led to the largest recall in automotive history.
The whistleblowers provided extensive assistance and information to the U.S. government in its criminal case against Takata, according to law firm Constantine Cannon LLP, which represented two of them.
Takata agreed in bankruptcy court on Monday to pay the three men out of a reserve fund created during its bankruptcy proceeding. Although Congress passed a whistleblower act in 2015 the government has not completed work on a mechanism to pay awards. 
The whistleblowers, Mark Lillie and another man who remained anonymous, both former Takata employees, had asked a federal judge in Detroit and the bankruptcy court to set aside significantly more as the U.S. Transportation Department decides whether to grant them a whistleblower award, but they were not successful.
A third whistleblower who has not been identified in court documents is represented by another law firm.
At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
Nearly 30 million vehicles remain unrepaired in the recall that affected 19 automakers. 
The three sought awards under the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act. Congress directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to write rules for the program by June 2017, but the agency has not completed the work. The government could still award money to the three whistleblowers.
The law allows auto-industry employees who report serious violations of federal vehicle-safety laws to receive 10 percent to 30 percent of any monetary sanction over $1 million the government recovers based on whistleblowers' information.
A NHTSA spokeswoman said the agency was not involved in the award announced Tuesday. The agency is still working on writing the regulations, officials said.
Lillie resigned from his position as a top-level engineer in 2001, his lawyers said, adding that he turned over evidence to the government showing Takata knew as early as 1999 that its airbags could be deadly and provided emails and designs.
The anonymous whistleblower helped demonstrate that Takata ""falsified data, subverted testing procedures, and concealed reports its airbags were prone to failure,"" the law firm said.
The second whistleblower lives in an area where there is a Takata facility and works for a large corporate manufacturer there and fears repercussions, the law firm said. The 2015 law allows whistleblowers to proceed anonymously. 
Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 to a single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement.
Takata did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
In 2017, prosecutors in Detroit charged three former senior Takata executives with falsifying test results to conceal the inflator defect.
Last week, a U.S. Senate panel pressed automakers and regulators over why tens of millions of vehicles with Takata air bag inflators are unrepaired.

NHTSA said last week that 21 million of the 50 million air bag inflators recalled by 19 automakers have been repaired.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" 
After declaring such an emergency, the president can block transactions and seize assets.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a potential takeover of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd, citing national security concerns.

March’s Conference Board survey of U.S. consumer sentiment shows retail investors’ enthusiasm for the stock market has dimmed to its lowest levels since the surprise victory of Donald Trump in November 2016.
Only a net 6 percent of those surveyed think equities will be higher in one year; the share was above 30 as recently as January. That was before the S&P 500 tumbled into its first correction in two years and last week’s harrowing selloff that wiped nearly $1 trillion from the value of American equities.
“Consumers aren’t nearly as ebullient on stocks as people assume they are,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. “If stock market tops are borne out of excessive greed, especially at the consumer level, these numbers would suggest that’s not the case right now.”
To the extent that this metric is a contrarian indicator -- as it was in November 2016 -- this implies that investors can expect fairly normal returns from U.S. stocks going forward, he added.
The survey was conducted prior to the Trump administration’s formal announcement of tariffs against China but after the proposed imposition of levies on inbound steel.

""BMW's representations were misleading for failure to disclose its emissions manipulations,"" the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey, said. 
The suit was filed by law firms Steve W Berman from Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, and James E. Cecchi from Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Olstein, Brody & Agnello, the filings show. 
BMW's X5 model built between 2009 and 2013, and the BMW330d model, which was sold between 2009-2011, emit levels of nitrogen oxide ""many times higher than their gasoline counterparts"" the suit alleges.
""The vehicles' promised power, fuel economy, and efficiency are obtained only by turning off or turning down emission controls when the software in these vehicles senses that they are not in an emissions testing environment,"" the suit said.
BMW was not immediately available for comment but has said in the past it did not use illegal defeat devices.
Software management programs to manage emissions are not illegal unless they are designed specifically to evade pollution tests, or unless a carmaker fails to disclose their existence.

Shares in BMW reduced gains sharply earlier on Tuesday with traders pointing to a Bloomberg report saying the German carmaker was being sued for installing ""defeat devices"" in U.S. diesel cars.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday resurrected a multi-billion dollar copyright case brought by  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Google's use of Oracle's Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, reversing a 2016 jury verdict.
The court sent the case back to a U.S. judge in San Francisco for a trial to determine how much compensation Google owes Oracle.
Oracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages.
""We are disappointed the court reversed the jury finding that Java is open and free for everyone,"" Google spokesman Patrick Lenihan said in a statement. ""This type of ruling will make apps and online services more expensive for users.""
""The Federal Circuit's opinion upholds fundamental principles of copyright law and makes clear that Google violated the law,"" said Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley in a statement. ""This decision protects creators and consumers from the unlawful abuse of their rights.""
The closely watched case, which dates to 2010, involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language, which Google used to design the Android operating system that runs most of the world's smartphones.

Oracle is seeking royalties for Google's use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leading U.S. consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called ""substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.""
On the same day, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook, demanding to know more about the company's role in the manipulation of users' data by the consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.
“These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook’s policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed,” the letter said. ""We need to know that users can trust Facebook. With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.”
Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day's losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.
The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.
The recovery in Facebook's stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company's relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.
The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.
If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.
“We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information,"" Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday. ""We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.”
ALL APOLOGIES
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company's privacy practices.
The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.
The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.
“Facebook's failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,"" said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
In Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is ""absolutely certain"" that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.
Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.
""The was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Zuckerberg said in the ads. ""We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.""
'FUTURE REGULATION'
His apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany's justice minister said Facebook's promises were not enough.
""In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,"" Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.
Advertisers and users are also unhappy.
U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube for one week.
Internet company Mozilla Corp and Germany's second-largest bank  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) suspended advertising on Facebook last week.
Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.

Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will act to prevent the smuggling of cheap steel and aluminum into the North American market to avoid new U.S. tariffs on the metals, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
Trudeau said this month he was aware of concerns that countries facing the tariffs could try to ship supplies through Canada and pretend the metals had been produced in Canadian facilities.
Under new measures unveiled by Trudeau's office on Tuesday, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will gain new powers to stop companies that try to dodge duties.
The CBSA will also have greater flexibility in determining whether prices charged in the exporter's domestic market are reliable or distorted.
""We will not allow North American industries to be hurt or threatened by unfair trade practices, like the diversion of steel and aluminum ... Canada will not be used as a backdoor into other North American markets,"" Trudeau said in a statement.
Canada will also coordinate more closely with its partners to strengthen border enforcement and meet more often with the United States and Mexico, its partners in the NAFTA trade pact, to discuss problems facing the steel and aluminum industries.
The measures will come into force after a 15-day consultation period.
Canada - the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States - currently has 71 trade remedy measures in force on steel and aluminum imports alone, the statement said.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico but suspended them temporarily, saying his final decision would depend on how much progress was made at talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trudeau spoke to President Donald Trump on Monday and ""raised the strong measures Canada is taking to address unfair trade in steel and aluminum,"" according to a separate statement issued by the Canadian prime minister's office.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for more than 50,000 British car owners kicked off a lawsuit against Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in London's High Court on Tuesday in a battle for compensation over a diesel emissions scandal that has engulfed Europe's largest carmaker since 2015.
The three-day hearing will determine whether the claims can be managed collectively under a Group Litigation Order (GLO) and will set a deadline for claimants to sign up to what lawyers say could become the largest group action in British legal history.
Volkswagen has said that about 11 million cars worldwide - and 1.2 million in the UK - were fitted with software that cheated diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution.
VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.
But it has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis of its 78-year history, dubbed ""dieselgate"".
British law firm Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 40,000 claimants in Britain, alleges that VW deceived people into buying cars that breached emissions regulations by installing ""defeat devices"", illegal engine management software designed to mask true pollution levels. 
""The lawyers will argue that VW profited by lying about the compliance of their cars and betrayed the trust of consumers who thought they were purchasing a car that met emissions standards and which was fit to be sold to UK customers when this was not the case,"" the firm said in a statement. 
The German company has offered to fix UK vehicles, and has said it broke no British laws and that drivers suffered no loss. German and British VW officials were not immediately available for further comment.
Slater and Gordon said it had surveyed more than 11,600 affected car owners who had agreed to the VW fix, which amounts to a software update of the engine management system. Over 50 percent of respondents regretted having it carried out, the lawyers said.
It said more than one in ten car owners told its survey that vehicles lost power at high speed, exposing them to danger after VW fixed their car. Drivers also reported poorer fuel efficiency and engine power and car juddering, it said.
""VW's only response has been to offer consumers in the UK a fix that our clients are telling us doesn't work,"" said Gareth Pope, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon.
Slater and Gordon is one of at least three law firms hoping to be granted the GLO. Lawyers have said that they expect the suit to come to trial next year if it is not settled. 

If the GLO is granted, all past and present owners of affected VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda cars can join the claim, regardless of whether they have had their cars fixed by VW.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",China's BYD sees first-quarter profit falling sharply amid subsidy cuts,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd (SZ:002594) (HK:1211), backed by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), said on Tuesday its first-quarter net profit would likely fall sharply amid cuts to subsidies for new-energy vehicles.
BYD, which has invested heavily in battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles amid China's push for greener transport, estimated net profit for the first three months would fall between 75.2-91.8 percent versus a year earlier.
That would put profits for the quarter between 50 million yuan ($7.96 million) and 150 million yuan versus 605.8 million yuan in the same period in 2017.
The Shenzhen-based firm said its annual net profit fell 19.5 percent to 4.07 billion yuan last year, roughly in line with preliminary figures release last month.
In 2016, the firm's net profit had jumped almost 80 percent.
China's central government wants the country to be a world leader in new-energy vehicles (NEVs) and related technologies, but has been looking to phase out financial subsidies that have been behind the rapid growth of the sector. 
Domestic and international industry executives have called for continued policy support from Beijing to help maintain growth in the world's largest NEV market, where broader auto sales growth is slowing down.

BYD, which also has businesses in electric batteries and other transport services, should see earnings growth pick up in 2018, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting a 50 percent jump in net profit this year.

1247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Europe's Biggest Money Manager Is Staying Bullish on Russia,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s largest asset manager is tuning out noise from a deepening diplomatic spat and holding on to a big overweight in Russian bonds and the ruble.
Sergei Strigo, the head of emerging-market debt and currencies at Amundi Asset Management, says he “doesn’t see any reason” for the rising geopolitical tensions to damp his bullish view on Russian assets. He took part in the government’s $4 billion Eurobond sale, which came one day after the U.K. blamed Russia for poisoning an ex-spy on British soil.
“We still like Russia as an investment opportunity,” Strigo said from the London offices of the $1.8 trillion asset manager. “With oil prices at these levels, macroeconomic indicators in Russia remain very strong.”
Like many other investors who have grown used to bouts of political risk in Russia since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Strigo is betting the tensions won’t be sufficient to curb the appeal of debt offering some of the highest real yields in emerging markets. So far, the U.S. and European authorities have sought to punish Russia only through diplomatic channels, expelling more than 100 diplomats on Monday.

Russian stocks and the ruble have already recouped some of their losses from the dip after news about the diplomat expulsions broke on Monday. The ruble is on track to post a small quarterly gain against the dollar and credit risk is falling after touching a six-week low. Many investors are waiting to see how Russia responds to the expulsions before deciding what to do next.
Strigo says he’s watching the situation closely but is much more focused on macroeconomic indicators, such as the Russian central bank’s gradual approach to monetary easing and the rising price of oil. Restrictions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea don’t prevent investors from buying government bonds.
“As long as sanctions don’t impact investing in Russian assets in general, then there is no change,” Strigo said. “We have been overweight Russian assets for a while, that’s a view we are sticking with.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has begun searching for a new chief executive, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as investors grow frustrated with the slow turnaround of the loss-making German lender.
Paul Achleitner, chairman of the board, has initiated a search to replace John Cryan, the British chief executive officer who has been in office less than three years, the people said on condition of anonymity.
A senior executive at Deutsche separately cautioned that there was little that Germany's largest bank could do to quickly improve sentiment. 
""We cannot cut costs short term without sacrificing revenue going forward,"" the banker said on condition of anonymity.
""What we are working on is changing long-term processes. That's a real way to cut costs, but this takes time.""
The CEO search, which is in the early stages, and the call for patience come after a flurry of negative headlines for the bank after it reported a third consecutive annual loss.
The bank said its loss in 2017 was larger than initially reported, and it has warned about conditions in the first quarter.
The Times newspaper reported on Monday that Deutsche Bank was seeking to replace Cryan after a boardroom row over the bank's future and alarm at its performance.
The paper said that the bank had approached Richard Gnodde, a senior executive of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) but that he was believed to have turned down the position.
The paper also named Jean Pierre Mustier, chief executive of UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI), and Bill Winters, chief executive of  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) among other possible replacements. The banks declined comment or were not immediately available to comment.
All of the individuals cited by the Times declined the position, one of the two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""The fact is, as it stands today, Achleitner is empty-handed,"" said the person, referring to the bank's chairman who would oversee the appointment of a new CEO. 
NO BID
Deutsche Bank under Cryan has stabilized after speculation in late 2016 that it would need a state bailout to stay afloat.
However, the enduring fragility of the bank and its low share price have generated speculation it could be a takeover candidate. But the senior executive refuted that notion. 
""Nobody wants to,"" take Deutsche over, the banker said.
""We need to show that we can regrow the revenue base before we are attractive. And remember this is Deutsche. You cannot just bid for us.""
The bank has raised capital and made progress on its two retail banking divisions. Last week, it achieved a milestone in its turnaround by floating its asset management unit, DWS.
However, stories have emerged of discord at the top. 
One board member, Kim Hammonds, told leadership at a recent meeting that the bank was ""the most dysfunctional company"" she has ever worked for, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung quoted her as saying. 
INVESTORS UNHAPPY
Investors have grown increasingly jittery about the pace of the bank's turnaround. 
Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, which owns Deutsche Bank shares, said he and a few other investors met the bank's finance chief in Frankfurt late last year.
""We made the point clear that we are frustrated,"" Huenseler said.
Since then, bad news from the bank has continued to flow and some investors are calling for a replacement for Cryan.
""I think a reshuffle at the man helm is probably the right thing to do,"" Huenseler said. ""I don't think Cryan is the one who has the vision to lead Deutsche Bank into the new phase.""
While Achleitner has been sounding out potential candidates, he has not initiated a formal succession process with the bank's nomination committee made up of directors. 
On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank cited further progress in its restructuring by announcing the sale of its private and commercial banking business in Portugal to Abanca for an undisclosed sum.
""With the transaction, Deutsche Bank continues to execute its strategy to sharpen its focus and reduce complexity,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement.
In February, Cryan said the bank was aiming for a profit in 2018 but has not been more specific.

""Investors in Deutsche Bank have had to be patient,"" finance chief James von Moltke told investors last week at a conference in London. ""We are asking for continued patience.""

CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out a new iPad and classroom software aimed at grabbing more of the U.S. education market, but did not cut the price of its entry-level tablet despite schools flocking to laptops costing a third less.
Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools. 
The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.
Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.
Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.
""Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,"" she said.
Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School. 
The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.
""We've been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.
Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately. 
The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.
Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.
Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price. 
Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.
Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.
On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service. 
Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple's Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.
The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said. 
In the fall Apple will roll out ""Everyone Can Create"" lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing ""Everyone Can Code"" guides for computer programming skills.
The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.
""If you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it's expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,"" Milanesi said.

Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all revealed large gender pay gaps in their British operations on Tuesday, the latest banks to report lower average hourly pay for women caused by having fewer female staff in top roles.
Citigroup had the highest disparity in average pay for women among those banks, disclosing a mean gender pay gap of 44 percent for 2017. 
At Morgan Stanley, the gap was 42.8 percent, a spokesman said. Credit Suisse put its gap at 39.2 percent and Bank of America reported a difference of 28.7 percent.
The disclosures indicate how few women have made it to the higher-paid, higher-profile roles in British banking.
The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average hourly salary of men and women, and is different from equal pay considerations, which examine disparity in pay for the same work at the same level of seniority.
The British government has ordered thousands of large UK employers to disclose their gender pay gaps by April 5. 
Credit Suisse's UK chief executive and group chief financial officer David Mathers sent a memo to all UK staff, which Reuters saw.
""For me, these numbers are disappointing, and while they reflect an improvement, there is clearly much work to be done,"" Mathers wrote, referring to the fact that the median pay gap had improved to 28.9 percent in 2017 from 31.9 percent in 2016.
All four banks said the main cause of the gap was the higher proportion of men in senior roles.
""Addressing this gap through a more gender-balanced workforce at our own organization, and across the broader financial services industry, will take time,"" said Sheri Bronstein, BAML's global human resources executive, in the bank's report.
The banks said they had made some progress in recent years, but they have a long way to go before equality is reached. 
Citi said its board of directors was 31 percent female, and that women now headed its operations in 26 percent of its countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa, up from 15 percent in 2014. 
The pay disparity for bonuses is even higher than for average pay, with Bank of America and Credit Suisse reporting mean gender bonus gaps of 57.9 percent and 70.2 percent respectively.
Morgan Stanley's mean bonus gap was 72.7 percent, the spokesman said.

The U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) disclosed a gender pay gap of 55.5 percent earlier this month.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 05:16AM ET</span>",Nestle's Milkybar targets healthy sweet spot with designer sugar,"By Martinne Geller
YORK, England (Reuters) - Nestle is launching a lower-sugar Milkybar made with a new version of the sweetener which could help ease the $185 billion confectionery industry's growing public health headache.
Milkybar Wowsomes, a new more expensive take on the 81-year-old white chocolate made famous by the gun-slinging Milkybar Kid ads, will be on shelves in Britain and Ireland in coming weeks.
The world's largest packaged food company says the new bars have 30 percent less sugar than a typical chocolate bar, helped by the use of Nestle's new ingredient, sugar that has been physically altered to be lighter and dissolve faster. But they have only 3 percent fewer calories, due to extra natural ingredients.
The new sugar, first discussed publicly in 2016, partly addresses one of Big Food's toughest challenges - how to make junk food healthy but keep it tasty.
""Health is important, but ... many consumers are not ready to give up taste,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said. ""If you could have a tablet of chocolate with the same taste with 30 percent less sugar, I think consumers would jump on it.""
Nestle's marketing chief says the aim of the new chocolate, which underwent more than 300 recipe tweaks, is to give parents the option of a better treat for their children.
Unlike the original plain white Milkybar chocolate, Wowsomes have a chocolate shell around a creamy center containing both the lighter sugar and crisped oat cereal.
""We felt it was important to signal that this brand is evolving and answering new consumer trends,"" Patrice Bula, head of marketing, told Reuters.
Nestle shares were up 1.4 percent on Tuesday.
Nestle is under shareholder pressure to accelerate sales after six years of slowing growth, with the sector struggling as consumers seek fresher foods and flock to new, independent brands seen as healthier or more ethical.
Governments are also cracking down on sugar to help fight obesity, but taxes, like the one coming into effect in Britain next week, generally concentrate on soft drinks.
Companies like Nestle are trying to stay ahead. Next month it is rolling out San Pellegrino soft drinks with the low-calorie sugar substitute stevia, which will keep the fruit-flavored drinks below the new British tax threshold.
Nestle's new invention is not for use in drinks and for now, it is just in confectionery - one of the toughest categories to reformulate, as chocolate can be up to 55 percent sugar.
SUGAR RUSH
Nestle executives said it was too early to specify how much this development would curb sugar purchases, although the company is looking to cut back over time.
Although the move by one of the world's largest sugar buyers will not impact demand overnight, it may serve as a litmus test for other manufacturers, industry sources said.
Nestle's business in the UK and Ireland has already taken out 10,400 tonnes of sugar from its portfolio since 2015. A long-term move away from sugar could spell disaster for farmers in top producing countries like India and Brazil, which together produce over 65 million tonnes of the sweetener each year. 
Global production continues to rise, outstripping demand and hurting prices. Benchmark raw sugar prices have slid 17 percent so far this year, after falling over 22 percent last year. http://tmsnrt.rs/2DIcmEG
Following the UK test, Nestle hopes to roll the sugar out elsewhere, focusing first on childrens' confectionery brands.
""We have quite a few brands in a lot of markets in Latin America, but also in Europe and Asia that could use that technology,"" Bula said.
The company declined to say how much the project had cost, but for Jas Scott de Martinville, head of confectionery research and development and the product technology center in the northern English city of York, where the chocolate was developed, it was money well spent.
""Every time you create something as break-through as this, you learn so much ... Our scientists in Switzerland will use the knowledge gained to help us advance in other categories.""
In 2016, Nestle said the product had the potential to reduce total sugar by up to 40 percent in confectionery. Milkybar Wowsomes have only a 30 percent reduction, partly because the chocolate shell utilizes regular sugar.
POROUS PARTICLES
Nestle says the new sugar is made by spraying a mixture of sugar, milk powder and water into warm air which forms a porous sugar structure that melts more quickly, meaning that less sugar can be used for the same amount of sweetness.
The idea is similar to that behind SODA-LO Salt Microspheres, which Tate & Lyle (LON:TATE) launched in 2012, with hollow spheres that allow for sodium reduction.
Most packaged food makers have initiatives aimed at making their products healthier, but some say there is a limit.

""It would not make sense to cut sugar in all our chocolate by 2-3 percent or to use stevia everywhere,"" Lindt & Spruengli CEO Dieter Weisskopf said this month. ""That would harm the taste.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares surged on Tuesday on incipient signs of a detente in trade rhetoric between Washington and Beijing, while French supermarket Casino was boosted by a grocery delivery partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The STOXX 600 index gained 1.3 percent with all sectors rising, on track for its best day in seven weeks, while Germany's DAX led with a 1.6 percent rise. 
European markets took their cue from a robust rebound on Wall Street and Asian stocks after reports the United States and China were negotiating to avert a trade war.
It marked a sharp bounceback from the previous days, in a sign that volatility was returning to stock markets. 
""The volatility that we're seeing in markets reflects those who were initially fearful of the headlines, and those that see opportunities within that,"" said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance. 
Dyer remains overweight European stocks and underweight the U.S. 
""What we see in Europe is valuations are lower, whereas the opportunity for margin expansion is more significant,"" he said, adding there is a ""fair dispersion"" between European and U.S. valuations. 
He said he had added to some industrials stocks that had suffered due to the fear of trade wars.
Autos,, chemicals, tech and basic resource sectors led gains after having suffered the most from fears of increased protectionism. 
Casino shares jumped 4 percent after its grocery chain Monoprix said it would start selling its products to Parisian customers through Amazon's Prime Now service this year. 
Bernstein retail analyst Bruno Monteyne said the deal was unlikely to be a ""game changer"" to competition in the French grocery market. 
""In the UK Amazon Prime Now has been selling Morrisons products for two years and is hardly measurable (0.07 percent of the UK market and growing at the paltry 50 percent),"" he wrote in a note to clients.
Despite Casino's share price gains, the retail sector index lagged the market. Amazon's expansion into Europe has struck fear into investors in some supermarket stocks seen as less adapted to a new retail environment.
A 6.5 percent fall in H&M shares also dragged retail stocks down. The Swedish fashion firm flagged further markdowns in the second quarter, reporting profits for Q1 fell roughly as expected.
The losses took H&M shares to their lowest in 13 years, trading at 119 Swedish krone, around a third of their value at their peak in March 2015.
Akzo Nobel shares gained 3.8 percent after the paint maker sold its specialty chemicals business to U.S. private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and Singapore's GIC for 10.1 billion euros ($12.6 billion) and said the bulk of the proceeds would go to shareholders.
Among tech stocks, chipmaker ams led gains, rising 3.4 percent, while peer Infineon led the DAX with a 2.7 percent gain, and STMicro climbed 2.2 percent. 
These semiconductor stocks have been the best-performing of the tech sector, leading last year's equity rally.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Facebook's Zuckerberg to testify before U.S. Congress: source,"By David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before U.S. Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday, as he bows to pressure from lawmakers insisting he explain how 50 million users' data ended up in the hands of a political consultancy.
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company's privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections. 
Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators.
Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. 
The tech sector is down 5.2 percent for March and on track for its worst month since April 2016. The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.
House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said ""The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify"".
On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong.
The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject. 
The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision ""astonishing"" and urged him to think again.
Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.
AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.
Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. 
In full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"". 
He apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.
The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.
The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing. 

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called ""substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.""

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 08:13AM ET</span>",Akzo Nobel reshapes business with 10 billion euro sale,"By Toby Sterling and Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Akzo Nobel will sell its chemicals business in a 10.1 billion euro ($12.6 billion) deal to buyers led by  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), the maker of Dulux paints said on Tuesday, making good on a promise made as it fought off a takeover last year.
The sale of the Specialty Chemicals operation to Carlyle and Singapore's GIC [GIC.UL] sovereign wealth fund for a slightly better than expected price will allow Akzo to focus on its main paints and coatings business.
It delivers one of the biggest commitments made by Akzo Nobel in its defense against a 26 billion euro ($32 billion) takeover offer from U.S. rival PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) last year. 
It may also help to repair strained relationships with shareholders unhappy with the rejection of the bid.
Akzo Nobel CEO Thierry Vanlancker, who took charge last July after the bid battle, expects 7.5 billion euros in net proceeds from the sale. The 10.1 billion euro valuation includes debt. 
The division being sold produces an array of chemicals used in plastic packaging, tissue paper, cleaning materials, pharmaceuticals, food products, salts and adhesives.
The 7.5 billion euro total will be returned to shareholders, Vanlancker told Reuters, with the company deciding on the distribution through dividends or share buybacks in the coming months.
The deal leaves Akzo as ""one of the top 3 largest paints and coatings companies in the world,"" Vanlancker said.
He said Akzo must now deliver on a goal to achieve a 15 percent margin on sales by 2020, after that measure fell to 9.4 percent last year.
That goal will mainly be delivered through cost savings and efficiency measures, Vanlancker said, as overall sales growth in the paints and coatings market is expected to remain modest.
""We will be looking at size (acquisition) opportunities as they come along"", Vanlancker said. ""But size is really not top of mind, it's performance of the business.""
The remaining Akzo business will have 35,700 employees, while Speciality Chemicals employs around 10,000.
DEFENSE PLAN
Akzo will try to strengthen its position in promising markets such as powder coatings, which showed 10 percent global growth last year, the CEO said. Akzo also expects its sales of decorative paints in China and Europe to increase. 
Shares rose 2.9 percent to 77.28 euros by 1300 GMT. That is still well short of the figure of around 95 euros in the cash and share offer from PPG last year.
Analyst Wim Hoste of KBC said the sale price for Specialty Chemicals represented a multiple of 9.8 times core earnings, ""which is a bit higher ... than we were banking on.""
Bankers advising potential buyers had said they expected the business to fetch an enterprise value of 8-9 times the unit's expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Carlyle had been vying for the asset with U.S. private equity firm Apollo and its consortium partner, Dutch fund PGGM, as well as Dutch investor Hal Investments, and Advent International partnered with Bain Capital Private Equity, people familiar with the matter had told Reuters.
Akzo first announced plans to sell the business last April, when PPG was in full pursuit. Many shareholders were dismayed as Akzo's boards appeared uninterested in talks with PPG and when they ultimately rejected the U.S. company's best offer. 
With support from Dutch politicians, Akzo argued a takeover was not in the interest of other stakeholders, including employees.
Shareholders sued unsuccessfully to have chairman Antony Burgmans removed. Akzo's CEO and chief financial officer both resigned last year on health grounds. Burgmans is due to retire after next month's annual meeting, with former Maersk CEO Nils Andersen nominated to take his place.
Vanlancker said Akzo had extracted promises from Carlyle to keep the chemicals company's head offices in the Netherlands, though it made no commitment to retain all of the business's 2,500 employees in the Netherlands.
The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be concluded before the end of the year, Akzo said.

Lazard, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC advised Akzo Nobel on the sale. ($1 = 0.8023 euros)

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>","In China payment war, Walmart places bet on Tencent","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc has placed a bet on Tencent Holdings Ltd's mobile payment system, giving the tech giant a boost in its battle with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd for pole position in China's fast-growing payments market.
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, on Tuesday said it had dropped Alibaba-linked Alipay in all its stores in the western region of the country, after agreeing a tie-up with Tencent to use its popular WeChat payment system.
The move underscores how China's retail market is dividing into two camps around Alibaba and Tencent, tech behemoths worth a combined $1 trillion who are shaking up the online and offline retail market.
The two firms, who have spent billions of dollars on retail deals since the start of last year, dominate the country's third-party mobile payment market. Alibaba-linked Alipay leads the field, with Tencent's WeChat Pay catching up fast.
Chinese consumers - and retailers - often have both Alipay and WeChat, which can be used to pay for shopping online or in physical stores by scanning QR codes with a smartphone.
Alibaba is China's top e-commerce player, while Tencent is strong in social media and gaming and has - along with Walmart - a major stake in number two online retailer JD.com Inc.
A Walmart spokeswoman said the firm had entered into a ""partnership"" with WeChat Pay in western China, which was a ""business decision"" to improve customer experience.
The Western China region is a large area including provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu. It is, however, more sparsely populated than the wealthier eastern part of the country.
""In the future, Walmart will cooperate with more partners to provide payment solutions with more convenience and benefits,"" she said in emailed comments, adding the firm accepted payment methods including cash, cards and mobile payments.
Tencent said it welcomed Walmart's decision and would push forward with plans to help support vendors with digital tools in the ""smart retail"" arena.
Alibaba and Alipay declined to comment.

The Walmart move comes after Tencent and Alibaba have between them splashed over $10 billion on retail-focused deals, boosting their reach offline and meaning few brick-and-mortar sellers are left without an allegiance to one or the other.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 09:36AM ET</span>",GSK buys out Novartis in $13 billion consumer healthcare shake-up,"By Ludwig Burger, John Revill and John Miller
FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) is buying  Novartis  (S:NOVN) out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion, taking full control of products including Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol headache tablets, muscle gel Voltaren, and Nicotinell patches.
GSK's biggest move since Emma Walmsley became chief executive last year follows the British drugmaker's decision last week to quit the race to buy Pfizer's (N:PFE) consumer healthcare business, endangering an auction the U.S. company hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion.
Consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, but they are typically well-known brands with customers. 
""The proposed transaction addresses one of our key capital allocation priorities and will allow GSK shareholders to capture the full value of one of the world's leading consumer healthcare businesses,"" Walmsley said in a statement on Tuesday.
Although some pharmaceuticals groups have been keen to hold consumer care products, intense price competition online, mainly from Amazon (O:AMZN), as well as cheaper store-brand products, have led others to doubt their stable returns longer-term.
The British group's shares jumped 6.1 percent, outperforming a 2 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care (SXDP).
GSK said that as well as ending the Novartis venture it would start a strategic review of Horlicks and other consumer nutrition products, sparking another potential industry shake-up. The review will include an assessment of its majority stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (NS:GLSM).
""The decision not to pay up for Pfizer's consumer assets will have led GSK CEO Emma Walmsley to remove uncertainty by bringing all the consumer revenues in-house and assisting toward efficient capital allocation,"" said Ketan Patel, co-manager of the Amity UK Fund at EdenTree Investment Management, who holds GSK shares.
""Long-term investors will welcome the greater clarity this brings to both companies.""
GSK said that the purchase would boost adjusted earnings and cash flows.
 Pfizer  has been struggling to sell its consumer healthcare business after GSK and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) both dropped out of the bidding, while differences in price expectations have also hobbled German drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) attempts to sell its consumer products unit.
And GSK's call for bids for its consumer healthcare nutrition brands - with a regional focus on India - could detract attention from Merck's asset, which relies heavily on sales of vitamins and dietary supplements in emerging markets.
NOVARTIS SHARES RISE
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said Glaxo was paying less than 17 times expected 2018 core earnings for the joint venture stake, while sources have told Reuters that both Merck and Pfizer had asked for up to 20 times for their respective assets.
Yet analysts at Baader Helvea welcomed the cash price fetched by Novartis as ""excellent news"" for the Swiss company, whose shares opened 1.9 percent higher.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said the move decluttered Novartis's portfolio, but cautioned that the Swiss group was being too vague about what it would do with the cash.
""The time is right for Novartis to divest a non-core asset at an attractive price,"" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said.
Novartis said the money would be used by Novartis to expand its business organically as well as for bolt-on acquisitions.
In an interview before the deal was announced, Narasimhan ruled out large acquisitions by the Basel-based company.
""We want to focus our M&A efforts on bolt on acquisitions that have either new technologies or products that fit into our core therapeutic areas,"" he told CNBC in an interview recorded on Sunday.
For Narasimhan, a Harvard trained medical doctor, the disposal is among his first moves as CEO, a role he took on less than two months ago when he replaced Joe Jimenez.
He is now emphasizing the use of technology to boost returns on research investment but Novartis is currently also reviewing its Alcon eye care unit for a possible spinoff to shareholders, which could come in early 2019.
Under the 2014 deal to pool their consumer assets, Novartis had the right so sell its 36.5 percent stake to Glaxo from this month. The transaction is set to complete in the second quarter, subject to necessary approvals.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 02:24AM ET</span>",Nissan spins up new plant to give second life to EV batteries,"NAMIE, Japan (Reuters) - At a small plant intended to help revitalize a town ravaged by the 2011 earthquake, Nissan Motor Co is giving its costly electric vehicle (EV) batteries new life after they pass their peak performance.
Global automakers are looking for ways to make cheaper EVs and prolong the life of their batteries, which can account for up to one-fifth of each vehicle's cost and are made from increasingly costly materials, including cobalt and nickel.
Starting in May, 4R Energy Corporation, a joint venture between the Nissan and Sumitomo Corp will begin selling rebuilt replacement lithium-ion batteries for the first-generation Leaf.
The batteries will be produced at the new factory in Namie by reassembling high-performing modules removed from batteries whose overall energy capacity has fallen below 80 percent.
They will be sold in Japan for 300,000 yen ($2,855.51), roughly half the price of brand-new replacement batteries for the world's first and best selling mass-marketed all-battery EV.
""By reusing spent EV batteries, we wanted to raise the (residual) value of EVs and make them more accessible,"" said Eiji Makino, CEO of 4R, which on Monday opened the plant in Namie, Fukushima Prefecture, around 5 kilometers north of the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world's worst since Chernobyl in 1986. 
The flat, rectangular battery packs that line the bottom of each Leaf chassis are trucked into the plant, where each module is assessed. 
Sumitomo has come up with a way to analyze all 48 modules contained in each battery pack in four hours, a huge time savings from the 16 days Nissan engineers previously used for similar measurements.
Modules with capacities above 80 percent are assigned for use in replacement Leaf batteries; lesser modules are reassembled and sold as batteries for fork lifts, golf carts, and lower-energy applications such as streetlamps.
The plant can process 2,250 battery packs a year, and initially plans to refabricate ""a few hundred"" units annually, Makino said, adding that 4R would see whether the process could also be used for batteries from the latest Leaf model, which uses a different battery chemistry.
Bracing for a sharp increase in the price of key EV battery materials, including cobalt, nickel, and lithium, more automakers are focusing on reuse and recycling, with Toyota Motor Corporation announcing in January it would partner with a Japanese electric power company to explore such options.
Makino said it would be difficult for 4R to completely break down and recycle EV batteries on its own but may consider partnering with another company to retrieve reusable materials, a process industry experts say is key to sustainable EV battery production. 
""Second use is potentially a really great option, but at the end of it all, batteries still need to be recycled,"" said Jeff Spangenberger, energy systems researcher at the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory, adding that the profitability of battery recycling operations would depend on the highly volatile price of component materials.

PHOENIX, Ariz. (Reuters) - The governor of Arizona on Monday suspended Uber's ability to test self-driving cars on public roads in the state following a fatal crash last week that killed a 49-year-old pedestrian.
The decision to block Uber Technologies Inc's is a blow to the ride-hailing company, which sees its future success reliant on driverless vehicles, and trails competitors such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo in developing the technology.
Arizona had been a key hub for Uber, with about half of the company's 200 self-driving cars and a staff of hundreds. 
In a letter sent to Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and shared with the media, Governor Doug Ducey said he found a video released by police of the crash ""disturbing and alarming, and it raises many questions about the ability of Uber to continue testing in Arizona.""
Police and safety regulators are investigating the March 18 fatality in which a woman crossing a four-lane road at night was struck and killed by an Uber self-driving SUV. The incident has focused new attention on the lack of clear safety standards for such vehicles. 
Ducey called the crash ""an unquestionable failure.""
""In the best interests of the people of my state, I have directed the Arizona Department of Transportation to suspend Uber's ability to test and operate autonomous vehicles on Arizona's public roadways,"" Ducey said.
The letter strikes a dramatically different tone from late 2016, when Ducey invited Uber to his state with celebration, saying ""Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads."" At the time, a banner was hung on a building in Phoenix welcoming Uber.
Uber moved its driverless cars to Arizona from San Francisco after California regulators shut down the self-driving fleet for not having the proper permits.

Uber, which had already pulled its self-driving cars off the road after the accident, said in a statement on Monday that it will ""keep a dialogue open with the Governor's office to address any concerns they have.""

Germany's largest bank has approached Richard Gnodde, a senior executive of Goldman Sachs (N:GS), to take on Cryan's role less than two years into his tenure, the newspaper said.
Deutsche Bank was not immediately available to comment on the London newspaper's report. https:// 
Gnodde, who is a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, is said to have been pursued by the lender amid a breakdown between Cryan and Deutsche Chairman Paul Achleitner, the Times said.
Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a comment.
Gnodde is believed to have turned down the proposal. Other possible replacements considered are Jean Pierre Mustier, chief executive of UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI), and Bill Winter, chief executive of  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN), according to the Times. 
Cryan and Achleitner are said to have disagreed over their approach to HNA Group, the Chinese conglomerate which became the German bank's largest shareholder, the Times reported.
Cryan and Deutsche Bank's chief financial officer, James von Moltke, were involved in a bitter board dispute over the bank's future, arguing for a more radical restructuring that included a complete overhaul of its investment banking division, the Times said, citing a source.
""It is quite clear the relationship is broken between the chief executive and the chairman"", the Times quoted the source as saying.
Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank warned on costs for 2018, citing delays in some business disposals, even as the lender said it expects revenues to rise for the full year.
It also said its bonus pool would be above 2 billion euros ($2.49 billion) as the loss-making bank seeks to retain staff during a major overhaul.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 08:44AM ET</span>",Risk assets jump on reports of U.S.-China trade talks,"By Tom Pfeiffer 
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets jumped on Tuesday as reports that the United States and China were negotiating to avert a trade war whetted investors' appetite for riskier assets. 
Japan's Nikkei share index (N225) rose 2.7 percent for its best day in almost three months while a 1.4 percent gain by Europe's Stoxx 600 (STOXX) put it on track for its best daily performance in seven weeks. 
The reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist shift is more about gaining leverage in trade talks than isolating the world's biggest economy with tariff barriers that would stifle global growth. 
This helped offset news that the United States and many of its allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. 
U.S. stocks <.SP500> are still 7 percent below their January peaks and some investors are not rushing to recalculate risks around Trump's America First trade agenda. 
""He can flip-flop quite a lot,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam. ""The big problem is, how long will it take before new tweets and headlines that will change the sentiment again?""
Daalder said he was underweight emerging market equities and the Nikkei and overweight other developed markets ""based on the expectation that there will be more trade uncertainty"". 
White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Monday to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. 
EURO REVERSES EARLY GAINS
The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) inched up to 2.848 percent, but remained short of last week's top at 2.90 percent. 
In currency markets the early reaction was to offload both the yen and the dollar, helping the euro to an early gain.
But the single currency later went into reverse after data showed lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust. 
The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, (DXY) used the euro's weakness to rally 0.4 percent to 89.424, bouncing off a five-week low hit on Monday. 
The improved mood on trade earlier pushed China's yuan to a two-1/2 year high and gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing. 
In oil markets, Brent crude (LCOc1) added 31 cents to $70.43 a barrel. 
Daalder said there had been no clear flight to quality since February's burst of equity market volatility, with scarce volatility in currencies and little movement in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. 

""It seems to be that the U.S. has lost some of its shine as the safe market to which people turn when things get rough,"" said Daalder. ""It’s partly the uncertainty in the U.S. itself which is playing a role.""

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Avon calls truce with Barington, nominates CEO Mitarotonda to board","(Reuters) - U.S. cosmetics maker  Avon Products  Inc (N:AVP) has reached an agreement with Barington Capital to nominate the investor's chief executive officer, James Mitarotonda, to its board in exchange for avoiding a proxy contest, a filing on Monday showed. 
Investors Shah Capital, Barington Capital Group and NuOrion Partners had pressured the cosmetics maker to explore strategic options, including a sale. The trio together hold a 3.4 percent stake in the company.
Mitarotonda, who runs Barington Capital, will join Avon's board, the company said in a regulatory filing. 
The settlement comes just 10 days after the New York-based investment firm notified the company it planned to nominate its own directors to the board. 
In exchange for the board seat, the parties agree to not run the proxy contest and to support management's directors, the filing said.
Barington first publicly disclosed its stake in Avon in December 2015.
Since then the firm has been increasingly vocal about its frustrations, which include deteriorating operating performance. 
Last year, Avon's then-CEO, Sheri McCoy, said she would step down in March 2018 after activist investor Barington pressured the company for her removal. In February, Avon named former Unilever NV (AS:UNc) executive Jan Zijderveld to lead the company.
Barington Capital and Avon were not immediately available for comment. 
Barington and the other activists had become increasingly frustrated with the long process of finding a new CEO and had been pushing the company to consider a sale. While they were pleased with Zijderveld’s appointment, they continued to lobby for operational changes and board changes.

Avon's shares were trading nearly 3 percent higher in after-market trade on Monday.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 12:16AM ET</span>",GM says South Korean unit will file for bankruptcy if no union concessions by April 20,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) said its loss-making South Korean operations would file for bankruptcy if its union did not agree to cut labor costs by April 20, heaping pressure on workers and the South Korean government to swiftly agree a rescue plan. 
The U.S. automaker announced in February it would shut down one of its four factories in South Korea, and asked for government support and union concessions to stay in South Korea.
Barry Engle, the President of GM International, also told the union leader of GM Korea on Monday the unit needed to secure $600 million in operating funds by the end of April, the union said in a document reviewed by Reuters. 
A GM Korea spokesman said the union concessions were needed for the automaker to present a confirmed turnaround plan to the government by April 20. GM wanted the union to reach a wage deal by the end of March, he added. 
If GM Korea failed to present the plan by April 20 it would have no choice but to file for bankruptcy, the spokesman said.
The crisis at GM Korea has created challenges the administration of President Moon Jae-In, who came to power last year promising to prioritize job creation.
A government official told Reuters GM appeared to be ""using threats to ramp up pressure on the union to make concessions by the end of March"". He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Engle, based in Detroit, has made a flurry of visits to South Korea this year. He met the chairman of GM Korea's second-largest shareholder, state-funded South Korean Development Bank, on Tuesday morning, followed by vice industry minister Lee In-ho later in the day, according to the GM spokesman.
CASH CRISIS?
South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its Chevy global output at its peak.
But the automaker's decision to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea. 
Almost 2,500 workers at GM Korea, some 15 percent of its staff, have applied for a redundancy package that the U.S. automaker is offering as part of a drastic restructuring, union officials have said previously.
According to the union, Engle said GM Korea may consider more voluntary redundancies for the remaining 680 workers at the Gunsan factory which will face a shutdown by May. 
Engle said the South Korean government should also promise to provide support for GM Korea by April 20, the union document said.
Earlier this month, KDB began a due-diligence review of GM South Korea to decide whether to inject more capital into the unit. The review is expected to be completed by mid-May. 
The union said earlier this month it will not demand a pay rise and bonuses this year, but instead wants the U.S. automaker to provide a future production plan and job security.
GM Korea still wants the union to agree to cut benefits worth 80-90 billion won ($74-$84 million), a union official said on Tuesday. The automaker had already achieved cost cuts of over 500 billion won through union concessions on wages and bonuses and voluntary redundancies, the union official added. 
GM Korea plans to slash 5,000 jobs, or about 30 percent of its workforce, but keep production steady if Seoul agrees to its $2.8 billion restructuring proposal, according to a document seen by Reuters earlier this month.
GM Korea, which employs nearly 16,000 people, has said that without new funding from its major shareholders it would face a first-quarter ""cash crisis"". 
GM owns 77 percent of its South Korean unit GM Korea, while KDB owns a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, controls the remaining 6 percent.
GM headquarters in Detroit has lent its South Korean unit some $2.7 billion won, which it offered to swap into equity if it gets government support and union concessions. 
GM last month agreed to grant temporary relief in repaying 700 billion won in debt due at the end of February, with more debts due in the coming months.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 07:08PM ET</span>",DISH executive testifies against planned AT&T merger with Time Warner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top executive of  DISH Network  Corp (O:DISH) argued on Monday that AT&T Inc's (N:T) planned purchase of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) would give AT&T too much power to block competitors' access to crucial content. 
The U.S. government is seeking to stop the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers. Monday's testimony was the second day of the trial that is due to last six to eight weeks.
Testifying for the government, Warren Schlichting, who negotiates to buy programming for DISH's satellite and its Sling internet business, said that his company needed to have the rights to broadcast some Time Warner content, especially news like CNN and sports, like college basketball's March Madness, in order to attract and keep subscribers.
""It's hard to imagine spring without March Madness. It's hard to imagine an election without CNN,"" he said. 
The clout that the deal would give AT&T in negotiating with pay TV competitors is why Justice Department filed suit in November to stop AT&T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the merger. AT&T says a merger would benefit consumers by creating efficiencies.
Schlichting agreed that AT&T's purchase of Time Warner would give it the incentive to sharply raise rates or withhold Time Warner's sports, news, movies and TV shows if the judge hearing the case allows the merger to go forward.
""We need each other now,"" he said. ""With the merger that changes 180 (degrees).""
Schlichting's testimony echoed that of Cox Communications content buyer Suzanne Fenwick, who last week described Time Warner's movies, television shows and sports programming as ""must-have content"" for the cable TV provider.
Monday's hearing was delayed because Schlichting's counsel gave him transcripts of opening arguments and Fenwick's testimony from last Thursday, which is not allowed, said Judge Richard Leon, who is deciding the case.
""If this happens again, hopefully it will not, the witness will be struck,"" he said.
If the government loses, that could open up the field for more tie-ups between distributors and content providers. But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers. 

Unlike most merger trials, this one is closely watched in political circles since President Donald Trump publicly criticized the deal as a candidate and as president, and the Republican president often has excoriated Time Warner's CNN news network.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 08:39PM ET</span>",Hartford approves deal for Connecticut to pay city's debt,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hartford, Connecticut's fiscally distressed capital city, will get a much-needed lifeline after its city council on Monday approved a deal to have the state pay its debt.
The accord, part of a broader oversight plan that state lawmakers agreed to last year, calls for Connecticut to take over the city's roughly $540 million of general obligation debt.
The oversight deal and bailout helped Hartford avoid a bankruptcy filing. The aid was included in the state's biennial budget passed in October, nearly four months overdue.
Monday's vote comes just in time for the state - which has its own financial problems, including a $193 million budget shortfall - to make Hartford's April 1 debt service payment of $11 million.
Mayor Luke Bronin presented details of the aid package on Thursday to the city council, which voted unanimously to accept the deal at its regular meeting Monday night.
Half of the capital city's property is tax-exempt because of its high concentration of state, nonprofit, university or hospital-related property, making it hard to raise money from its tax base.
Bronin has already slashed spending and renogotiated labor contracts to help stabilize city finances. 
Asked what message Monday's agreement sends to capital markets for future borrowings, Bronin said the city does not intend to issue new debt any time soon. 
He expects necessary capital improvements to be paid for with operating funds, though budgets will be tough for years to come.
""Over the longer run, I hope what the markets see is continued discipline, continued commitment to fiscal sustainability and a continued partnership between the city and the state,"" Bronin said in a phone interview on Monday.
In exchange for the bailout, Hartford must agree to have its state-run review board approve its fiscal 2019 budget. The city must also provide ongoing financial reports to state officials and limit its borrowing so that years down the road it has only $100 million of debt outstanding.
Most of Hartford's general obligation bonds are insured.
Build America Mutual insures $103.2 million of the city's general obligation debt, and  Assured Guaranty  Ltd (N:AGO) another $339 million as of the end of December, the most recent information available.
Both insurers declined to comment on the agreement.

The plan gives the state ""tools to protect its investment,"" State Treasurer Denise Nappier said in an emailed comment to Reuters. Nappier is co-chair of the city's oversight board.

TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Canadian lender Callidus Capital Corp lost as much as 21.6 percent in two trading sessions, hitting an all-time low, after a Reuters report on Friday raised questions about the valuations that parent company Catalyst Capital Group Inc assigned to some of its portfolio companies. 
Callidus, which offers high-interest loans to distressed companies and went public in 2014, is one of the largest holdings in Catalyst’s private equity funds. Among other things, the Reuters report said that Callidus has so far been unable to find a buyer to take the company private. Catalyst said in a press release last year that it was targeting a price of C$18 to C$22 a share. 
Callidus shares dropped 6 percent on Friday. The slide continued on Monday, with the stock falling as much as 16.5 percent to hit a record low before ending down 6.4 percent at C$6.23, a drop of about 39 percent since the start of the year. 
The Reuters report, citing various sources and documents, also noted that at least three other of Catalyst’s major assets have struggled to find buyers at the firm’s valuations. 
A spokesman for Callidus and Catalyst, which are both headed by Newton Glassman, declined to comment for this story on Monday.
Catalyst, in a statement issued on Friday after Reuters published its reporting on the firm, said that the news organization was “unobservant” of the nature of private equity and of Catalyst’s accomplishments in “rebuilding broken companies.” 
“We can only stand dumbfounded by the failure of Reuters to understand the basic value creation principles required to grow companies and the care we take to protect and maximize returns,” Catalyst said. 

After Callidus reported its most recent quarterly earnings in November, National Bank analyst Jaeme Gloyn said in a report, ""We believe recent performance materially impacts both the probability and the valuation of a privatization transaction."" Callidus said on Monday it would report fourth-quarter results on April 2.

1318,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Consumer Confidence, Fed Speak, Richmond Fed Manufacturing in Focus 
As fears of a U.S.-China trade war have eased somewhat, a pair of economic reports on consumer confidence and regional manufacturing activity is expected provide investors with an insight into the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.
Economist forecast the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge to show a reading of 131.2 for March from 130.8 in the previous month.
The Richmond Fed manufacturing index for March is expected to fall to 23 from a reading of 28 in February.
A speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President, Raphael Bostic, at 11:00 a.m. EST is also expected to draw investor focus after the Fed policymaker said Friday he would support further rate hikes this year if the economy continued to strengthen.
U.S. stock markets rebounded sharply on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing more than 600 points higher amid a WSJ report indicating that China and the U.S. “have quietly started negotiating” to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.
There is growing belief among market participants that President Donald Trump’s recent move to introduce tariffs were not intended to spark a trade war but rather gain leverage to negotiate better trade terms with crucial trading partners.
Co-Chief Investment Officer of Bridgewater Associates Ray Dalio said President Donald Trump's recent introduction of tariffs could be a negotiation tactic and a political move that needn't mean a trade war is likely.
Dalio added that the most likely scenario is a progression toward a negotiation on some trade agreements that will look like victories for Trump, so tensions will subside and the markets will like it.
""At such times, I believe that it is especially important to keep one's portfolio liquid (to be flexible) and diversified (to not have concentrated risks),"" Dalio wrote in a LinkedIn post.
2. Build in Crude Supplies to Resume?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday after data last week showed crude inventories unexpectedly fell.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 2.739 million barrels for the week ended March 23. That closely matched the 2.622 million barrel decline reported by the Energy Information Administration during the same period.
Crude oil futures made a subdued start to the week as a combination of profit taking and renewed focus on rising U.S. output weighed. But crude oil prices remained supported as traders continued to bet that Middle East geopolitical risks could lead to a disruption in supplies.
The risk of a disruption to global inventories has increased following President Donald Trump’s decision to promote John Bolton to National Security Advisor, given the latter’s hawkish views on critical issues like the Iran nuclear deal.
3. Facebook Rebound to Continue?
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) briefly fell into bear market territory – down 20% from its recent high – but ended the day in positive territory paring a more than 5% intraday slump.
The fall in Facebook came as the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal intensified after the Federal Trade Commission said Monday it takes ""very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.""
""The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,"" Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said. ""Foremost among these tools is the enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises.""
The rebound in Facebook coincided with a similar move in other tech names, supporting a 3% rally in the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite.
Dropbox Inc (NASDAQ:DBX), meanwhile, continued its bright start to life as a publicly-listed company, rising nearly 7% to $30.45."

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",CLO managers bank on no appeal to Dodd-Frank exemption,"By Kristen Haunss
(LPC) - Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds are already being issued that do not comply with Dodd-Frank risk-retention rules, as managers bet that regulators will not appeal a February court decision. 
A US Appeals Court ruled on February 9 that CLOs, the largest buyer of leveraged loans, should be exempt from the regulation which requires managers to hold 5% of their fund. 
The decision could further boost CLO issuance as managers that lacked the capital to meet the rules may now be able to raise new funds, after an already strong start to the year with US$28.5bn of volume, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data.
The prospect of a potential appeal is complicating the matter, however. Regulators have until Monday to seek a Court of Appeals review and a separate 90-day window to request a Supreme Court review. 
Managers are keen to issue now amid some of the lowest CLO spreads in 10 years and do not want to hold part of their fund if they do not have to. 
Bain Capital Credit, BlueMountain Capital Management and Neuberger Berman may have found a solution by arranging new or reworking existing CLOs without complying. They are including an option that could increase the size of the fund to buy retention and become compliant if necessary, according to sources. 
“The idea is to be as transparent as possible that if the US risk-retention rules are not applicable to the subject transaction, the related sponsor is not intending to purchase and/or retain the applicable notes,” said Sean Solis, a partner at law firm Dechert. 
Funds would otherwise have to avoid issuing until the court ruling is finalized or hold retention that may not be required in the near future. 
CLOs sell tranches of varying risk to investors backed by a pool of loans made to large US companies, including retailer Party City and Dunkin' Brands, which runs the Dunkin’ Donuts chain. 
The Loan Syndications and Trading Association, the trade association representing the US CLO and leveraged loan markets, successfully sued the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014, arguing the regulation was “arbitrary, capricious” and “an abuse of discretion.” 
Some CLO managers may wait until the appeal period is over before creating new funds, but many are keen to price now to take advantage of pre-crisis lows on debt tranche coupons. 
Spreads on the Triple A tranche of recent CLOs, the most senior portion of the funds, have dropped to the low 90 basis point area, according to LPC Collateral data. 
Lower debt coupons boost payments to the most junior investors, the equity, who are paid last with the interest left over after all other distributions are made.
Managers may also want to get ahead of a possible burst of activity if the rule is finalized, as firms that were unable to issue or rework deals due to capital constraints return to the market.
NO RETENTION
Bain told potential investors in its US$611.3m CLO this month that it would not comply with the rule initially, but could increase the size of the deal to buy retention if necessary, according to a preliminary deal document. 
Neuberger Berman refinanced its Neuberger Berman CLO XXI last week. It also chose not to hold retention at pricing but the fund allows for an upsizing to become compliant if needed, according to two sources. 
BlueMountain told investors in a term sheet for a reset of its BlueMountain CLO 2015-3 that if it determines after pricing that risk retention will apply on the closing date, the deal will be increased to buy retention, according to three more sources.
Spokespeople for Bain, Neuberger Berman and BlueMountain all declined to comment. 
There are institutions offering managers short-term financing to bridge the gap in case they need capital to purchase retention. 
Some managers have alternative language in their deals and lined up temporary financing to comply with the rule if regulators appeal the Court of Appeals’ decision, according to Neil Weidner, a partner at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
It is unclear how many CLOs have included this language, but it is an option many investors seem willing to accept for now.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>","Citi, Goldman and rivals ramp up Brazil banker poaching war","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Global investment banks from  Citigroup  to Goldman Sachs are hiring again in Brazil after years of retrenchment as historically low interest rates fuel a recovery as well as a small boom in M&A and stock and local bond offerings. 
Most of the moves, several of them involving one bank hiring away top talent from another, are likely to wrap up by the end of the first quarter, when bonuses related to the former year are paid. 
Some of the hirings were announced late last year and effective from February to April.
Although there is no official data on investment banking jobs in Brazil, the elite bankers whose employers' steel and glass towers line Sao Paulo's Faria Lima avenue represent less than 2 percent of the 467,900 employees of the banking industry in the country. 
Citigroup Inc.'s (N:C) Brazil unit late last year poached Eduardo Miras, former co-head of investment banking at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), to head Citi's equivalent unit, which has remained active even after the U.S. bank sold its retail business to Brazil's Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4).
More than two executives also left Morgan Stanley to join Citi with Miras, people with knowledge of the matter said. The banks declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley, in turn, hired former Citi managing director Felipe Mattar a month later and relocated two other executives within the bank to Brazil. 
Flavio Valadao, former head of investment banking at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11), is expected to begin as vice-chairman of the Brazilian unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) next month, after the departure of Patricia Moraes, who had been at the U.S. bank for more than 20 years.
“We are investing in new hirings due to the increased activity in Brazilian capital markets and M&A,"" JPMorgan's head of investment banking in Brazil Pedro Juliano said in an interview at the bank's headquarters in Sao Paulo last week.
Among other Wall Street banks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) hired banker Ricardo Bellissi, who had replaced Valadao as the head of investment banking at Santander Brasil. To replace him, Santander hired Paulo Mendes, who was running his own M&A boutique. 
BUSY YEAR
Last year was Brazil's busiest for initial public offerings since 2013, with 10 IPOs raising $5.5 billion. Including secondary offerings, Brazilian companies raised around $13 billion, nearly five times the amount in 2016. 
Brazilian mergers and acquisitions activity surged 33 percent last year to $61.8 billion in deals, driven by asset sales by conglomerates under pressure for corruption probes, such as J&F Investimentos, which also owns meatpacker JBS SA (SA:JBSS3). 
Deals in the first quarter were valued at nearly $15 billion with an increasing number of acquisitions motivated by big synergies or bets on the country's recovery, such as the deal between pulp makers Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SA:SUZB3) and Fibria Celulose SA (SA:FIBR3) announced earlier this month.
Brazilian banks such as Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) and Banco BTG Pactual SA , which already had larger deals teams and did not cut staff as much during the recession, have not hired senior people recently. Some of them, such as BTG Pactual, are adding junior bankers. 

""We do not radically change the team's size according to market conditions, we endure the cycles,"" said Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Itaú Unibanco's investment bank, Itaú BBA SA.

according to a filing with the Federal Trade Commission, as the U.S. aero parts maker explores a breakup of its businesses.
Loeb's Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd has requested permission from the U.S. consumer protection regulator to acquire shares in the company above a certain threshold, according to the filing dated March 23 on the FTC's website. 
Shares of Farmington, Connecticut-based  United Tech  rose as much as 3.6 percent to $126.73 on Monday.
United Tech declined to comment and Third Point was not immediately available for comment.
United Tech, which makes Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners, in February said it would decide by the end of 2018 whether its businesses were more valuable together or better off as separate entities.
Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes has said if the company were to split, its aerospace business would have about $45 billion to $50 billion in sales, Otis elevators unit about $12 billion to $13 billion, and the climate-control business about $17 billion to $18 billion.
The CEO has indicated that a final review of its businesses was possible after it closes the acquisition of avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL) by the third quarter of 2018.
The company's shares have lagged the broader market under Hayes as the company spent heavily on developing a new fuel-saving geared turbofan aircraft engine and as sales of Otis elevators were pressured by a supply glut in China.
Up to Friday's close, United Tech's shares had fallen about 9.4 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 13.9 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI).

Billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management is also building a position in United Tech, according to reports in February.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","European shares fall as euro surge, Russian tensions weigh","By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday as a late surge in the euro and diplomatic tensions with Russia more than offset hopes that the protectionist shift in U.S. trade policy may be more selective and tactical than first feared. 
The regional STOXX 600 benchmark (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent to its lowest level since February 2017, having earlier gained as much as 0.6 percent following reports the United States and China had quietly started negotiations to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets. 
""Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners, which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war"", said Accendo Markets head of research Mike van Dulken. He noted that China's response so far was ""measured"" and ""nuanced"".
European equity markets however slipped into negative territory as the euro gained further strength. Traders said sentiment was also dented by growing diplomatic tensions between Western countries and Russia.
""Despite a bright opening in the U.S. with Wall Street seeing early gains of over 1.5 percent, increased geopolitical tensions with Russia ensured that volatility was alive and kicking,"" said Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index. 
The United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain that they have blamed on Moscow.
A sales trader at a European brokerage however said he did not see how these tensions could have any big impact on global economic growth.
Stocks exposed to Russia were mixed. Raiffeisen (VI:RBIV) rose 2.5 percent, helped by a price target upgrade at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), while  Renault  (PA:RENA) gained 0.3 percent, Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) slipped 0.5 percent, and  Buzzi Unicem  (MI:BZU) dropped 3.2 percent.
Among other European benchmarks, Spain's IBEX (IBEX) dipped only 0.1 percent, after the country's second ratings upgrade of the year led to a further outperformance of its bond market over euro zone peers.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) underperformed, down 1.2 percent, as speculation grows the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government.
The political uncertainty triggered a rise in Italian bond yields.
Italian banks, widely used as proxies to trade political risk in the country, fell 1.7 percent. 
Elsewhere,  Fresnillo  (L:FRES) rose 4.6 percent to lead gainers on the STOXX after an upgrade to ""buy"" from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which also added the miner to its ""conviction list"".
Other top gainers were Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN) and Indivior (L:INDV), both up more than 3 percent.

 Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG) fell 3.4 percent after it rejected a revised takeover offer from International Paper.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 01:04PM ET</span>",ITER nuclear fusion project avoids delays as U.S. doubles budget,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - The United States has agreed to double its planned 2018 budget contribution to the ITER project to build a prototype nuclear fusion reactor, avoiding delays to the international project this year, its director said on Monday. 
Washington cut the United States' 2017 contribution from a scheduled $105 million to $50 million and had planned to cut its 2018 contribution from a scheduled $120 million to $63 million.
But in last-minute talks about the U.S. 2018 budget last week, the U.S. Congress approved a draft Omnibus Spending Bill with a $122 million in-kind contribution for ITER, which President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday, ITER said. 
""This is a very positive signal ... it will prevent ITER having to announce project delays in 2018,"" ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
He added that if the United States would make up for missing cash contributions of about $120 million for the 2016-18 period, ITER would remain on track in future years. 
The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project is a cooperation between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea to build a prototype fusion reactor to generate electricity in a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun.
With an estimated cost of about 20 billion euros ($25 billion), the project is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035.
ITER member countries contributions to the project are not mainly in cash but in kind, as they finance the manufacturing of ITER components via their own national companies. These parts are then shipped to France and assembled on ITER's Cadarache, southern France site.
But there is also a cash contribution, which for the U.S. was 30-32 million euros per year in the 2016 to 2018 period, or about 100 million euros, Bigot said.
""We hope that at least maybe a small part of the U.S. 2018 contribution could be in cash so as to give a political signal to the other ITER members,"" said Bigot, who was appointed ITER director in 2015.
ITER's main U.S. supplier is California-based General Atomics, which is building the project's central solenoid, an 18-metre tall pillar-like magnet that will be one of the first components to be installed by 2020.
The United States has given about $1 billion to ITER so far, and had been planning to contribute an additional $500 million through 2025.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs' stock-based pay ratio still much higher than rivals',"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) pays employees a much bigger portion in stock than Wall Street rivals, a trend that has come into sharper focus as the bank overhauls its business strategy.
Goldman’s “burn rate” – the proportion of outstanding stock used to pay everyone from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein to rank-and-file workers – averaged 3 percent over the past three years, the bank said on Friday in its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
That three-year burn rate compares with 0.64 percent recently reported by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), and 1.82 percent at financial companies in the S&P 500, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).
Big investors take notice of a burn rate because it measures how much value a company transfers to executives, said John Roe, head of ISS’s data arm.
""The faster the company is diluting shareholders, the harder the company has to work just to get up to par,” Roe said.
Investors asked Goldman to put a special focus on its stock grant practices and how they dilute shareholders during feedback sessions last year, the bank said in its proxy filing. A spokeswoman declined to comment further. 
If the high burn rate persists, Goldman stock could become less attractive to investors relative to its peers while potentially weighing on its operating performance.
Although Goldman slashed its annual burn rate to 2.2 percent last year from 6.6 percent in 2010, it remains elevated partly because of its business mix, which the bank is now trying to change.
Unlike rivals that have big retail operations stocked with bank tellers and other salaried branch workers, Goldman’s workforce is more weighted with investment bankers and traders. They typically receive a hearty portion of their pay in stock. That is by design, to better align their interests and risk-taking with shareholders.
Goldman also has been aggressively buying back stock, which elevates the burn rate. The bank has reduced outstanding shares 27 percent since the end of 2009, giving it a historically low share count, according to its proxy.
CHANGES AFOOT 
Looking ahead, Goldman is moving into businesses like digital banking to offset declines in bond trading, its one-time profit engine. It has also been shifting workers from big cities to low-cost hubs to cut compensation expenses. Those trends could help subdue its burn rate. (http://reut.rs/AdGtFv)
Goldman finds itself using “muscles we never exercised before” as it shifts toward consumer-facing businesses, Blankfein told an audience in Boston last week.
“For us, there’s an evolution here. We became a bank holding company over a weekend,” Blankfein said, alluding to a move forced by the 2007-2009 financial crisis. “We didn’t do a lot of bank-like activities that could even be in a bank.”
Building “Goldman Sachs 3.0” is a process that will take time, he said.

As the biggest individual holder of Goldman shares, Blankfein arguably has more at stake in the transition than anyone else. The 2.3 million common shares he owns is worth about $571 million, according to the company’s proxy.

Zenith, owned by France's Publicis (PA:PUBP), forecast that advertisers would spend 40.2 percent of their budgets on online campaigns this year, higher than 37.6 percent in 2017.
""For many consumers, checking their mobile devices for social media has become a regular, ingrained habit, while social media ads blend seamlessly into their mobile app newsfeeds,"" Zenith said in a statement.
Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook (O:FB) is often credited with spearheading the social media revolution that has gripped billions of users globally. 
However, the world's largest social media network faces government scrutiny in Europe and the United States following allegations by a whistleblower that British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information.
Global advertising expenditure is forecast to expand by 4.6 percent in 2018 to $579 billion, helped by improved economic growth in China and Argentina. 
The new projection marks the biggest quarterly upgrade since March 2011 by Zenith, which had forecast 4.1 percent growth in December. [nL8N1O41AI]
Zenith added that it expected advertising expenditure to grow more slowly than the global economy as a whole out to 2020.
Zenith forecast that global advertising spending would rise by $77 billion between 2017 and 2020. 
The United States, the world's largest economy, would contribute the most to this additional outlay - 26 percent, with China ranked second.
A notable development in China is that television has fought back against strong competition from online video and no longer loses ad spend, which it did in 2014, 2015 and 2017, Zenith said. 
In the Middle East and North Africa, a fall in oil prices in 2014 prompted advertisers to pare budgets in anticipation of lower consumer demand. Political turmoil and conflict have worsened, further shaking advertisers' confidence in the region, Zenith said.
The forecaster estimates a 6.2 percent fall in ad spend this year in the region.
Zenith forecast 8.8 percent annual growth to 2020 in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which were hurt by the Ukraine conflict in 2014, foreign sanctions on Russia and the drop in oil prices.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 10:56AM ET</span>",Exclusive: South Africa investigates $60 million SAP contract,"By Alexander Winning and Joe Brock
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's anti-corruption agency is investigating a 671 million rand ($60 million) government contract with German software firm SAP, which has admitted misconduct in separate deals involving friends of ousted president Jacob Zuma.
The Public Protector, an independent watchdog mandated by the constitution, said it had received an anonymous letter alleging due process was not followed in the award of a contract to SAP in 2016 to provide IT and support services to the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS).
The investigation comes at a time the DWS is under growing pressure from opposition politicians who blame it for failing to avert a chronic drought in Cape Town and as parliament prepares to investigate mismanagement at the department.
Since replacing Zuma in February, President Cyril Ramaphosa has pledged to crack down on corruption after a string of scandals. Several investigations into government and private companies have since moved forward.
""The Public Protector is investigating the SAP licenses,"" a spokesman for the agency, Oupa Segalwe, said. ""The allegation is that SAP licenses for both the department and water boards were purchased without following due process.""
The Public Protector has carried out several influential investigations, including one in 2014 that was instrumental in making Zuma repay more than $600,000 of state-funded security upgrades to his private home.
In 2016, the watchdog revealed details about the undue influence Zuma's friends, the Guptas, had over the awarding of state tenders and the role played by global firms.
SAP declined to comment on the agency's inquiry or give details about the contract but said it was conducting a review of all its deals with the South African government back to 2010.
""SAP is aware of this contract which forms part of the broader ongoing SAP South Africa investigation,"" SAP spokesman Rajiv Sekhri said. ""If we identify any matters of concern we will address and manage them vigorously and comprehensively.""
The anonymous letter received by the anti-graft agency also alleged the contract was unnecessary because existing DWS licenses with SAP covered the same services.
A DWS spokesman said the ministry was not aware of the Public Protector's investigation and denied any wrongdoing.
""No evidence of corruption exists as the procurement followed a full process,"" Sputnik Ratau said.
MINISTRY UNDER FIRE
The SAP contract has already been mentioned by lawmakers looking into mismanagement at the water department, as well as in an Auditor-General report last year that concluded the ministry had been guilty of wasteful and fruitless spending.
Mlungisi Johnson, chair of parliament's Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation, said lawmakers had asked DWS officials about the SAP contract but received contradictory information.
""We invited them to parliament and gave them an opportunity to explain themselves clearly. They didn't take it and now they will face an inquiry,"" Johnson told Reuters.
He said the committee would meet on Tuesday with the Auditor-General, Treasury and an investigative unit that reports to the presidency to finalize the scope of the parliamentary inquiry into DWS.
The DWS spokesman did not respond in detail to allegations of mismanagement although he said there were lessons to be learned from the drought in South Africa, which has been declared a national disaster.
The Auditor-General said DWS signed a deal with SAP to provide five years of IT products for 450 million rand and two years of support services for 221 million rand. The Auditor-General's report said it believed the cost was ""high"".
It said 285 million rand had already been paid to SAP.
The German company declined to comment on the Auditor-General's report or the parliamentary inquiry into the DWS.
SAP said this month an internal inquiry found it acted improperly by paying more than $9 million in commissions to companies controlled by the Gupta family to win contracts with state power firm Eskom and rail company Transnet.
However, the German company said there was no evidence of direct payments to South African government officials.
Three Gupta brothers are under investigation over accusations of corrupt links to Zuma. One of the brothers, Ajay, was declared a fugitive from justice hours before Zuma was forced out of office and has left South Africa.

BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark is under pressure to rule on whether a new Russian pipeline supplying gas to Germany can be built near its Baltic coast, a decision that puts it in the line of fire from friend and foe alike. 
Denmark does not want to act alone in resolving one of the biggest foreign policy quandaries that the small European Union nation has faced since the Cold War.
But its search for a united EU stance on the proposed pipeline is deadlocked by divisions among member states over whether to do more business with Moscow despite its military incursions in Ukraine and Syria and accusations it used a nerve agent in an attempted assassination on British soil.
The Danish government is facing fierce lobbying by Russia, EU allies and the United States over the 9.5 billion euro ($11.7 billion) Nord Stream 2 project championed by President Vladimir Putin and financed by five Western firms.
""They are under huge pressure from all sides,"" one senior EU official said. There is no definite timing for a decision, which had been expected this spring but has been delayed while Denmark considers the security implications. But officials say it cannot be postponed indefinitely.
 A Danish veto, under new legislation allowing it to do so on security grounds, would force Russia, which supplies about one third of Europe's gas needs, to find a new route for the pipeline.
""This is not about gas, it is one of the most important foreign policy decisions in Denmark since the Cold War,"" said senior foreign policy researcher Hans Mouritzen at the Danish Institute for International Studies.
 A delay would weaken Russian gas giant Gazprom's hand in talks with Ukraine for a new gas transit deal after 2019 and create uncertainty for the firm's partners: Germany's Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV and France's Engie.
 Access to cheap Russian gas to offset declining Dutch production takes priority for nations in northern Europe, particularly Germany, but eastern European countries fear the pipeline will make the EU a hostage to Russian gas.
SECURITY CONCERNS
In the Nordic states, where Moscow's military posturing in and around the Baltic Sea has rattled nerves, security is the main concern.
The United States has played up these worries in its opposition to Nord Stream 2.
Confidential guidance from Washington, seen by Reuters, for U.S. embassy officials in meetings with EU governments argues that the pipeline could strengthen Russia's projection of power in the region.
Sweden and Finland have yet to issue permits for the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline to run under the Baltic Sea through their exclusive economic zone, which is regulated by U.N. law. Germany did so earlier this year.
But only in Denmark would the undersea pipe pass through sovereign territorial waters, giving it a greater say.
U.S. diplomat Sandra Oudkirk, who visited Copenhagen on her first European tour as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Diplomacy last week, said Washington does not want Nord Stream 2 built and wants to understand ""if the Danish law is a means to that end"".
 ""TOO BIG FOR DENMARK""
Danish officials say they are loath to take sides and are unwilling to rush the decision.
""In some ways this is too big for Denmark,"" one official said.
Under the new legislation, Danish diplomats are drafting an opinion on whether foreign and security policy concerns justify blocking 139 km of the pipeline passing through Danish waters.
The opinion may take account of objections by EU allies: that the pipeline would undercut EU support for Kiev by depriving it of gas transit fees, increase dependence on Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) or concentrate gas supplies along a single route to Germany.
Lawmakers gave the government powers to reject the pipeline's application for a permit last November but had expected support from Brussels, where efforts to reach a consensus have stalled.
Denmark is one of 14 EU states to expel Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in Britain. It was too early to say whether the attack would be included in the foreign and security assessment of Nord Stream 2, Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said.
If Denmark acts alone to veto the project, that could have unwelcome consequences.
""If we are to handle this difficult case alone, Denmark will end up in an unfortunate situation in relation to both Russia and Germany,"" said Martin Lidegaard, a senior lawmaker with the Danish Social Liberal Party, which is against the project like the rest of the Danish opposition.
 
DIVERSION
 With ties between Moscow and Kiev badly strained after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, Russia wants to reduce dependence on Ukraine as a gas transit route.
 Any serious delay to the 55 billion cubic meter a year pipeline could imperil that plan as Gazprom seeks to extend two years of record gas sales to Europe.
The Nord Stream 2 consortium says it is carrying out surveys for an alternative route north of the Danish island of Bornholm outside Denmark's territorial limits. That would cost time and money.
""We have to plan for the possibility,"" its Financial Officer Paul Corcoran told Reuters. ""It will cost more,"" he admitted.
Pipeline contractor Allseas has said a change of route would add less than 5 percent to total costs.
But sources close to the matter doubt it will be as easy to reroute the pipeline as the company says.
 ""The Nord Stream 2 company takes it as a real threat,"" said a senior EU source who has seen an estimate of the cost of changing routes. ""I was shocked by how high it was,"" the source said without disclosing figures.
Nord Stream 2 declined to comment on the cost of rerouting, saying it did not wish to ""speculate about alternatives and its impacts"".
For now, Denmark is holding off as long as possible on making the decision. ""In this case we're hurrying very slowly,"" a government source said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a defeat to former American International Group Inc (N:AIG) CEO Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, refusing to hear an appeal he led arguing that the federal government illegally bailed out the insurer during the 2008 financial crisis at the expense of shareholders.
The justices left in place a 2017 ruling by a federal appeals court in Washington that Greenberg's Starr International Co had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue.
Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005. The New York-based insurance powerhouse was rescued by the U.S. government in September 2008 to stave off bankruptcy after the company ran up huge losses from insurance on shoddy mortgage securities.
Starr's attorney David Boies expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court's action.
""Starr established that the disproportionate and unfair treatment of AIG's shareholders in 2008 was not authorized by the applicable statutes and that the government had exceeded its authority by taking control of AIG and using it to bail out other financial institutions, which were found to have engaged in more risky practices,"" Boies said in a statement. 
Starr, an insurance and investment business that had been one of AIG's largest shareholders, sued in 2011 on behalf of itself and other shareholders alleging the government illegally took a 79.9 percent stake in the company in exchange for a $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
The shareholders' rights were diminished in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process under the law, Starr claimed, seeking more than $40 billion in damages.
A lower court ruled in Starr's favor, but declined to award damages since the shareholders' stock would have been worthless without the government loan. The bailout actually helped the plaintiff, that court said. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out that ruling, finding that only AIG, and not Starr as a shareholder, had legal standing to bring claims that the bailout was unlawful. AIG's board of directors decided not to file such a suit. 
AIG's bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion in profit.

Starr appealed to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump's administration urged the justices not to take up the appeal.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's  Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG) rejected a raised takeover offer from International Paper (N:IP) on Monday, frustrating a bid to combine the largest listed U.S. paper packaging firm with Europe's biggest.
The Memphis-based company, which has a market value of almost $21 billion, had raised its offer for Smurfit Kappa in hopes of entering into merger talks. Smurfit Kappa had turned down a proposed face-to-face meeting this month, it said.
""We believe our revised proposal is responsive to the views of Smurfit Kappa shareholders and provides a sound basis upon which to secure a recommendation from Smurfit Kappa's board,"" International Paper's chairman and CEO Mark Sutton said in a statement after Smurfit rejected its second offer in a month.
Smurfit said its board had unanimously rejected the increased offer of 25.25 euros in cash and 0.3 new International Paper shares.
The offer valued Smurfit at 8.9 billion euros ($11 billion)based on International Paper's closing price on Friday. The Irish firm said that remained well below valuations in recent industry transactions.
""The Board is resolute in its belief that the best interests of the group's stakeholders are served by pursuing its future as an independent company,"" said Smurfit, which operates in 35 countries in Europe and the Americas.
Smurfit Kappa shares were down 3.2 percent at 33.64 euros at 1306 GMT, though still 18 percent higher than the level they were trading at before International Paper's initial approach.
A merger would help International Paper diversify beyond North America and the company said it could generate annual synergies of at least $450 million at a one-off cost of $570 million.
Growth in consumer spending and online shopping have boosted demand for packaging in recent years.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Home improvement chain Lowe's CEO to retire, shares rise 8 percent","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) on Monday said its chief executive officer is retiring, the latest executive departure as the home improvement chain tries to move out of the shadow of larger rival  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) that has outperformed it for years.
Shares of Lowe's rose as much as 7.8 percent to $90.33 after Robert Niblock said he would step down once a successor was found.
The No.2 U.S. home improvement store has struggled to control margin pressures and its same-store sales growth has trailed Home Depot's for many years, weighed down by a focus on do-it-yourself customers compared to Home Depot's core customer base of professional contractors who bill more.
Lowe's underperformance has also attracted shareholder activism. 
Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group secured two independent board seats after taking a nearly $1 billion stake and agitating for change. 
""If you look at Lowe's relative performance against Home Depot, I think many people, not only D.E. Shaw, were calling for an agent of change,"" BTIG analyst Alan Rifkin said.
In the past year, Lowe's stock gained 1.7 percent, in contrast to Home Depot's near 17 percent rise. 
(For a graphic on Lowe's vs Home Depot financial performance click https://reut.rs/2IV3MGE) 
""A transition will be well received by investors, given their pent-up frustration with the company, and could be the first step toward improved operational execution,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.
Niblock's departure follows the retirements of the company's Chief Financial Officer Robert Hull and Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron over the past year.
Lowe's said its board has formed a six-person committee to find a successor, led by D.E. Shaw-backed director David Batchelder.
""After a 25-year career at Lowe's...I am confident that it is the right time to transition the company to its next generation of leadership,"" Niblock, who is also the chairman and president of the board, said in a statement. 
Since Niblock took the top job at Lowe's in January 2005, the company's sales have risen 88 percent to $68.62 billion, while the stock has gained more than threefold. 
Lowe's shares were up 5.7 percent at $88.55 in late morning trading.

Hedge fund Glenview has nearly 18 percent stake and has withdrawn its proposal made in February to amend Tenet's bylaws that would allow shareholders to take action by written consent without a meeting, the company said.
Last year, Glenview pulled off its two representatives from the board, citing ""irreconcilable differences"" over strategy.
As part of the latest agreement, Tenet has revised the special meeting bylaw so that it can only be amended by a vote from majority shareholders, handing Glenview a greater say in the company. 
Tenet also added it would hold an annual shareholder meeting at least once every 13 months. The company plans to hold a meeting in early May, according to a regulatory filing.

LONDON (Reuters) - GKN (L:GKN) promised on Monday a quick cash handout for shareholders if they back a sweetened offer for its auto business, raising the stakes in its battle to fend off a hostile bid for the entire company. 
In one of Britain's most tightly fought corporate battles for years, shareholders have until 1200 GMT on Thursday to accept the hostile bid from turnaround specialist  Melrose  (L:MRON), or GKN's plan to split off its auto unit and combine it with U.S. group Dana, leaving GKN focused on aerospace. 
Melrose's bid has so far split GKN shareholders, with two of the largest publicly coming out on opposite sides. Analysts predict the deal will go down to the wire.
On Monday, Dana increased the cash portion of its bid for GKN's Driveline auto business by $140 million. The bid values Driveline at $6.1 billion, including debt. 
In response, GKN said it would return up to 700 million pounds in cash to shareholders as soon as practicable, as part of an already announced 2.5 billion pound cash return program from the Driveline sale and the planned divestment of its powder metallurgy unit. 
That compares with Melrose's offer of 81 pence in cash for each GKN share plus 1.69 new Melrose shares, which would hand shareholders 1.4 billion pounds and 60 percent of the enlarged Melrose - a bid worth 7.8 billion pounds in total.
Should they back GKN management's plan, GKN shareholders would end up with 47.25 percent of the enlarged Dana group, which would be listed in both the U.S. and London. 
Peel Hunt analyst Harry Philips said the sweetened bid from Dana showed Driveline had been undervalued, the deal hurriedly made, and clarity was needed on the promised returns. 
""This (the quick 700 million pound payout) was not part of the original proposition, so this represents a change in calibration and we think that GKN needs to redefine the make up of the 2.5 billion pound return proposition,"" he said. 
A mainstay of Britain's engineering sector, GKN makes parts for the U.S. aviation industry, such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 jet and Black Hawk helicopter, as well as components for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford cars.
Illustrating the bitter nature of the takeover battle, it featured on the front page of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper on Monday: ""Don't let Vultures destroy a British colossus"", it said, noting some shareholders did not have a long-term interest in the company that helped make Spitfire fighter aircraft in World War Two. 
A source close to the bid battle said short-term merger arbitrage funds could own 20-25 percent of GKN shares. 
SHAREHOLDERS SPLIT
While the hostile bid has prompted criticism from politicians - concerned that after improving GKN, Melrose could break it up and sell parts to foreign buyers - the decision now rests with shareholders. 
Elliott Advisors, which has a 3.8 percent interest, making it one of GKN's biggest shareholders, on Friday backed Melrose's deal, saying it did not trust GKN management to deliver the ""profound"" cultural shift needed to meet new targets while driving through two major asset sales.
Columbia Threadneedle, with a 3.4 percent stake according to Reuters data, has said it will reject Melrose's offer.
GKN said that following Dana's improved offer for its auto business it would receive $1.77 billion in cash after deducting $1.0 billion for the transfer of a pension deficit to the combined Dana-GKN Driveline group. 
""We believe that the true value of GKN is over 5 pounds per share and that Melrose's final offer fundamentally undervalues your company and should be rejected,"" Chairman Mike Turner told shareholders.
The offer from Melrose values GKN at 451 pence per share in cash and shares, based on Melrose's share price on Monday. GKN's stock was trading at 431.5 pence at 1200 GMT. 
In a separate statement, GKN was forced to retract comments made to Sunday newspapers in which it said it thought investors would back its plan. It said the comments had not been verified. 
Melrose, prevented under UK rules from improving its offer as it has said its current bid is final, dismissed the sweetened Dana deal as ""a tweak"" and criticized GKN's management for making claims over shareholder support. 
""The last-minute attempts of claiming shareholder support that then had to be retracted is a sign of desperation,"" Melrose's Chairman Christopher Miller said. 
""We urge shareholders to cast their votes for a proven Melrose team with an outstanding track record and a plan to revitalize GKN.""

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: S&P Global cuts top sovereign analysts as part of broader cull,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest credit ratings agency S&P Global has cut more than five of its most senior sovereign analysts as part of a broader reduction of in excess of 100 staff, a source told Reuters.
The firm's highly-regarded sovereign division, which monitors the creditworthiness of some 130 countries, is also being folded into its bank-focused Financial Services arm.
The most high-profile exit under that reorganization has been its top global analyst, Moritz Kraemer, the source with knowledge of the cuts said.
Kraemer was the firm's public face for its mass downgrades of euro zone countries during the debt crises of 2011 and 2012, and for states hit by the commodity price collapse of 2014.
Others veterans to have left include its chief Europe, Middle East and Africa analyst Myriam Fernandez de Heredia Martinez and Liesl Saldanha, who oversaw Asia-Pacific from Singapore as well as a number of their deputies.
""The sovereign group has basically been dismantled,"" said the source who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity. ""It's a major decision. It took 25 years to build up the reputation as a leader in the sector.""
An S&P spokesman confirmed changes had been made but did not put a figure on departures. 
""We have made some organizational changes globally as we continue to move toward a structure that is simpler and more effective,"" the spokesman said. ""Some individuals are leaving the organization as a result.""
S&P Global, which is home to the Standard and Poor's name and employs around 1,400 analysts, has been in flux since it was rebranded from McGraw Hill Financial two years ago.
The latest cuts took shape last month when two of the firm’s three rating divisions, Sovereigns-International Public Finance and Financial Services' were combined at a regional level.
It was the sovereigns arm that took the hit in terms of senior staff though. The top Financial Services analysts took over the combined units in U.S. and Canada, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, while in Latin America the lead analytical manager for Corporates took control.
The source estimated that around 110 analysts had either been cut or left S&P's three ratings divisions. 
UNDER SCRUTINY
The changes are likely to raise eyebrows within the sector and the governments that S&P and its main rivals, Moody's and Fitch, monitor.
S&P has generally been faster and more aggressive with its sovereign rating moves than Moody's and Fitch over recent years, which has also led to some intense public scrutiny.
The firm and five of its former and current managers were acquitted last year after Italian prosecutors had accused them and Fitch's top sovereign analyst of market manipulation at the peak of the euro zone's downgrades.
It was censured for wrongly announcing France's rating had been downgraded in 2011 and that year had to hire round-the-clock guards for some top staff after it stripped the United States of its triple-A rating.
The sovereigns business brings in only about 8 percent of the firm's revenues - roughly the same as it was a decade ago. The larger Corporates division has doubled its contribution over that period to 55 percent.
S&P has an EU market share of 46 percent, ESMA data shows, well ahead of Moody's on 31 percent. 
It recently announced plans to make a new Dublin office its post-Brexit EU headquarters, despite already having sizable offices and staff numbers in Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan.
""It shows the desire of the firm to extract regulatory rent from this,"" the source said referring to the potential benefit of Ireland's lower taxes and more flexible labor laws. 
The big three agencies have most of their European staff in London, and are facing regulatory demands to move ""sufficient"" numbers of senior personnel to the EU when Britain leaves the bloc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street scored its best day in 2-1/2 years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its third-biggest point gain ever on Monday, as trade war fears eased on reports the United States and China are willing to renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances.
The rally, fueled by technology stocks, came on the heels of the indexes' worst weekly performance since January 2016, the S&P 500's (SPX) gain making up for less than half of the prior week's near 6 percent loss.
""We saw a really good rally because of potential talks with China,"" said Dennis Dick, Head of Markets Structure, Proprietary Trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. ""People are taking advantage of the huge dip last week.""
""I don't think you're out of the woods yet. There's political uncertainty,"" Dick added.
Last week's drop was fueled in part by tensions surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's move to levy tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, in addition to those imposed on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
But tensions were calmed as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang repeated pledges to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Sunday he believed Washington could reach agreement with China on some issues but tariffs would not be put on hold ""unless we have an acceptable agreement that the president signs off on.""
""It's clearly the easing of trade tensions. The comments by Steve Mnuchin late yesterday gave room for negotiation with China,"" said Oliver Pursche, Chief Market Strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
But China did call for unity among World Trade Organization members to prevent the United States from ""wrecking"" the WTO, and urged opposition to Trump's tariffs targeting China's alleged intellectual property theft.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 669.4 points, or 2.84 percent, to 24,202.6. The two larger point gains for the Dow were in October 2008. The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 70.29 points, or 2.72 percent, to 2,658.55 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 227.88 points, or 3.26 percent, to 7,220.54. 7,220.54
The three major U.S. indexes saw their best percentage gains since Aug. 26, 2015.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 (SPX) closed in positive territory, led by technology (SPLRCT) and finance (SPSY) indexes, up 4.0 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.
The tech sector saw its biggest daily percentage gain since August 2015 and financials had their best day since November 2016.
Microsoft (O:MSFT) pulled the indexes higher, gaining 7.6 percent.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upped its price target on the tech company's stock, saying its market value could hit $1 trillion on improved margins and growth in cloud computing. 
Intel (O:INTC) advanced 6.3 percent after brokerage Raymond James upgraded the technology to ""market perform"".
Facebook (O:FB) closed up 0.4 percent following several days of declines as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating how the company allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica. 
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500, finished down 3.84 points at 21.03.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.30 billion shares, below the 7.35 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - A grocery industry veteran who led U.K. retailer  Tesco  Plc's online operation was named president of Walmart's Jet.com e-commerce business in the retail behemoth's latest move to grab a bigger piece of the intensely competitive sector.
Simon Belsham will oversee all operations including grocery and general merchandise and join Walmart's (N:WMT) U.S. e-commerce leadership team, according to an internal email sent on Monday by Marc Lore, the head of Walmart's e-commerce business, to Jet employees and seen by Reuters.
Walmart acquired Jet for $3.3 billion in August 2016, a deal that was widely considered a watershed moment for its then-struggling e-commerce operation as it got access to both technology and talent through Jet founder Lore and his team.
Walmart's e-commerce success has been erratic. Online sales increased 23 percent in the most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. Walmart's stock got walloped after the news.
Belsham's hiring comes amid fierce competition in the grocery sector. Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) purchased Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.4 billion last year, and rivals like  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and  Kroger Co  (N:KR) are joining the costly battle for customers who want groceries without leaving their couches.
Walmart is aggressively ramping up its online grocery business. It has said it will expand home delivery service to more than 100 U.S. cities and offer curbside grocery pickup at 2,200 stores by the end of the year.
Jet's focus on groceries is likely to help Walmart win with urban millennial customers - Jet's key demographic.
""With Jet grocery being an integral part of the strategy, Simon brings incredible experience in scaling grocery delivery and his unique background in converging technology and retail,"" Lore said in the email.
Belsham spent seven years at Tesco (L:TSCO), building up its online grocery operation for Britain and 10 markets across central Europe and Asia. He also developed a general merchandise platform for Ocado (LON:OCDO), a UK-based web retailer that sells groceries.
Most recently, Belsham worked as chief executive officer of venture-backed Notonthehighstreet.com, according to the email.
He will succeed Liza Landsman, who left the company in March, a little more than a year after she was promoted to the job. Belsham will start on March 26, report to Lore and be based at Jet's New Jersey headquarters, according to the email.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a Feb. 20 earnings conference call the online retailer will not grow as quickly as it did in the early days but will be well-positioned in select markets.
Belsham will also need to ensure that Jet is differentiated from the parent brand and offer shoppers specialty goods that cannot be bought elsewhere - a strategy on which Lore has focused in the past year.
Belsham said in a statement he has long admired the founders of both Walmart and Jet.
""In my view, there is no business better positioned to take advantage of the opportunity ahead than the combination of Walmart and Jet,"" Belsham said.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",Hyundai union head fears GM-like crisis; says electric cars destroy jobs,"By Hyunjoo Jin
ULSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) union chief warned its workers may face a similar crisis to the one hitting General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit as sales in key markets slide, adding that electric cars were 'evil' and will destroy jobs.
South Korea's auto industry, known for its robust unions whose workers tend to be paid more and have better benefits than their compatriots in other sectors, has come to a crossroads.
Blaming high labor costs and falling sales, General Motors (N:GM) plans to close one of its plants in the country by May and is weighing options for its three other factories.
""We're feeling job anxiety. We're feeling a sense of crisis,"" Ha Bu-young, the head of the  Hyundai Motor  union, South Korea's biggest and most powerful union, told Reuters in an interview late last week.
He said that at three of Hyundai's five plants in Ulsan, the world's biggest car factory complex, some workers had been asked to take longer holidays as sales of sedans and older model SUVs like the Santa Fe slow in the United States and other markets.
Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) were also hit by diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing last year, leading to a slump in sales in the world's biggest auto market. The two automakers have flagged only modest global sales growth in 2018.  
Longer term, Ha worries about the advent of electric cars, which when they go mainstream could wreak havoc on traditional auto jobs as they don't require engines and transmissions. 
Hyundai's union has predicted a drastic shift into electric cars could lead to a loss of 70 percent of Hyundai jobs in a worst case scenario.
""Electric cars are disasters. They are evil. We are very nervous,"" he said.
Ha said the union is studying how cars of the future might be built without slashing headcount and has proposed the automaker revive a committee to review the impact of new vehicles and new technology on jobs.
He also noted that some 30,000 workers out of 50,000 union members will retire in 15 years, which could cushion the impact that cars of the future could have on staffing levels.
FREE TRIPS TO EUROPE
At GM's South Korean unit, the threat of potential plant closures has led its union to offer to freeze wages and skip bonuses while about 15 percent of its employees have applied for a voluntary redundancy package. 
While there is a sense of crisis at Hyundai's union, the situation is not that dire.
Hyundai's management has proposed the scaling back of some benefits such as free week-long trips to Europe for 500 workers annually as well as support for some employees' sporting events - a proposal that the union plans to oppose, a union official said.
But the union will for the first time seek pay raises for temporary workers this year that are higher than those of full-time auto workers, responding to criticism that regular auto works are generously paid. 
It will ask for a 7.4 percent wage increase for temporary workers versus a 5.3 percent wage raise for regular workers, Ha said, in line with a policy advocated by the umbrella union for South Korea's metal workers.
Last year Hyundai's union initially demanded annual wage increases of 7 percent for its full-time workers and won a raise of less than 5 percent after tense negotiations that involved strikes.

The shift towards improving pay for non-full time workers could invite opposition within the union, said Ha, adding that he was trying to right old wrongs.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",English court refuses to hear Dana Gas's appeal in sukuk dispute,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Dana Gas has lost an attempt to overturn English court rulings that backed creditors' demands for the repayment of $700 million of Islamic bonds, the UAE company said on Monday.
The English Court of Appeal refused an application by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) company to appeal the November 2017 and February 2018 English High Court orders.
Dana Gas last year shocked the global Islamic finance industry when it stopped payments on its sukuk, which matured in October, saying that because of changes in the interpretation of Islamic finance rules the bond had become unlawful in the UAE.
Instead, it proposed to exchange the sukuk for new instruments with lower profit rates. The proposal was rejected by bondholders and a legal battle started over the validity of the sukuk in both English and UAE courts.
While the English Court of Appeal’s decision may complicate further legal action by the company in English courts, proceedings in the UAE continue.
A court in the emirate of Sharjah, where Dana is headquartered, issued an order earlier this month prohibiting the company from withdrawing its legal efforts in the UAE.
The order was issued at the request of a plaintiff, Marwan John Shorkry Kattan, a shareholder in Dana Gas.
The Sharjah court also added BlackRock – one of the largest creditors of Dana Gas – to the UAE proceedings and issued an injunction prohibiting it and other creditors from taking any action against Dana Gas or its shareholders in the UAE and the United Kingdom until the UK courts' rulings ""are referred to the UAE judiciary to resolve their enforceability in the UAE.""
This could mean that Dana's creditors may not be able to advance any enforcing claims against the company and its assets as long as the UAE court orders remain in place.
Despite the ongoing legal dispute, Dana said on Sunday it would seek shareholder approval to pay a dividend for 2017 totaling about 349 million dirhams ($95.03 million).

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 03:11AM ET</span>",Short visits rise at Whole Foods stores with Amazon lockers,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shoppers are making more quick trips to Whole Foods stores that have installed Amazon.com (O:AMZN) lockers, giving the natural and organic retailer a new way to boost sales, research from location data advertising firm inMarket showed on Monday.
Short ""micro"" visits, defined as three to five minutes in length, were up 11 percent at stores with lockers since Amazon closed its purchase of Whole Foods on Aug. 28, according to an inMarket report provided exclusively to Reuters News.
That compares with the 7 percent gain at stores in the same cities that do not have the banks of lockers, inMarket said.
Amazon shoppers, including those seeking to avoid ""porch pirate"" package thefts, can choose to have their orders sent to a locker for one-time use at no additional cost. Amazon sends the customer the locker number and a unique code to open it and collect their package.
The firm studied 98 stores in the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Washington, Houston, Boston and Atlanta metro areas. Some 76 stores, or about 16 percent the chain's 473 stores, had lockers.
People who stop at Whole Foods to retrieve a package from an Amazon locker could be tempted to buy a drink, milk or a promoted item, said experts, who added that the trips are also a way for the retailer to keep shoppers abreast of changes at the chain.
""There's a serendipity and immediacy to the in-store experience,"" said Todd Dipaola, chief executive and founder of inMarket, which analyzes anonymous location data from the mobile devices of 50 million U.S. consumers.
""As good as delivery is getting - one-day delivery, sometimes one-hour delivery - that still can't compete with the one-second immediacy of being in store and picking up that avocado that I'm about to make guacamole out of because I thought about it in that moment,"" Dipaola said.
Micro visits have accounted for about 9 percent of all visits to grocery sellers so far this year, with Whole Foods lagging at 6.5 percent, inMarket said.
Representatives from Amazon and Whole Foods did not comment.
Whole Foods can drive impulse sales by placing products adjacent to lockers and providing quick and easy payment options, such as self-checkout, said Stewart Samuel, program director for IGD Services. He added that the chain already has tested an impulse/food-to-go area within a larger store in New York.
""While this would be additional volume for Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM), the impact on the convenience store channel overall would be negligible,"" Samuel said.
Amazon has lockers in 7-Eleven Inc convenience stores in more than 300 cities, according to published reports. Representatives from 7-Eleven did not comment for this story.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 09:14AM ET</span>",U.S. gunmaker Remington files for bankruptcy,"By Tom Hals and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Remington Outdoor Co Inc [FREDM.UL], one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday to carry out a debt-cutting deal with creditors amid mounting public pressure for greater gun control.
The company's chief financial officer, Stephen Jackson, said in court papers that Remington's sales fell significantly in the year before its bankruptcy, and that the company was having difficulty meeting requirements from its lenders. 
Remington, America's oldest gunmaker, announced in February it would reduce its $950 million debtload in a deal that will transfer control of the company to creditors. The company plans to wrap up its bankruptcy as soon as May 3, according to court papers.
The filing comes after a Feb. 14 shooting at a Parkland, Florida high school that killed 17 and spurred an intense campaign for gun control by activists.
The massacre led to huge U.S. anti-gun rallies by hundreds of thousands of young Americans on Saturday.
In some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, protesters called on lawmakers and President Donald Trump to confront the issue. Voter registration activists fanned out in the crowds, signing up thousands of the nation's newest voters.
Major U.S. companies and retailers have taken some steps to restrict firearm sales.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said last week it will require new retail-sector clients to sell firearms only to customers who passed background checks and to bar sales of high-capacity magazines.
Citi also said it was restricting sales for buyers under 21, a move adopted by other large retailers, while Kroger Co's (N:KR) superstore chain Fred Meyer said it will stop selling firearms entirely.
CERBERUS TO LOSE OWNERSHIP
Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls Remington, will lose ownership in the bankruptcy. 
Remington's creditors, which sources told Reuters include Franklin Templeton Investments and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, will exchange their debt holdings for Remington equity.
The creditors inked the debt-cutting deal prior to the Parkland shooting, and it is unclear if any have exited. The restructuring support agreement allows creditors to sell their holdings, but the buyer is bound by the deal.
One investor told IFR, a Thomson Reuters news provider, that his firm had contemplated buying the Remington loans that will be exchanged into equity, which were offered at as low as 25 cents on the dollar.
""We bowed out because we were uncomfortable,"" he said.
After a Remington Bushmaster rifle was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults, Cerberus tried unsuccessfully to sell Remington, then known as Freedom Group.
Katie-Mesner Hage, an attorney representing Sandy Hook families in a lawsuit against Remington, said in a prepared statement that she did not expect the gunmaker's bankruptcy would affect their case.
Remington and other gunmakers have suffered from slumping sales in the past year as fears of stricter gun laws have faded.
The chief executive of American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC), maker of the Smith & Wesson gun used in the Parkland shooting, said on March 1 that some gun retailers reported increased sales after the Florida school shooting. 

Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

1439,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 02:01AM ET</span>",Sinopec Offers Record Dividend as Fuels Power Profit Higher,"(Bloomberg) -- China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., the world’s biggest refiner, will pay a record-high dividend as its massive fuels and chemical segments helped boost annual profit about 10 percent.
Net income climbed to 51.1 billion yuan ($8.1 billion), the company known as Sinopec said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange Sunday. The company proposed a 0.5 yuan per share total dividend payout for 2017, the most since its listing in 2000 and above a forecast for 0.17 yuan in data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also flagged about 22 billion yuan in impairments, mostly in its upstream assets.
Sinopec’s refining and chemicals divisions have continued to support its earnings, with margins from turning crude into fuels rising 7 percent and the company reported selling greater volumes of higher value-added products.
“The strong result was driven by better profitability in refining and chemicals divisions,” analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). including Mark Wiseman wrote in a research note. The dividend payout was “the major positive surprise.”
To read more about analyst reaction to Sinopec’s earnings, click here.
Shares rose as much as 3.6 percent to HK$6.83 before paring gains to 2.1 percent as of 10:32 a.m. Hong Kong time. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 0.2 percent.
Gas Shift
The company has been shifting its upstream focus toward producing more natural gas, seeking to support President Xi Jinping’s drive of using more of the fuel instead of coal. Total output gained 3.4 percent to 446 million barrels of oil equivalent last year, it said in January, with gas rising 19 percent while crude slid 3.3 percent. It forecasts crude production will drop for a fourth year in 2018 and gas will rise further.
Sinopec’s profit missed a 53.6 billion yuan median estimate from 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 22 percent to 2.36 trillion yuan.
The company’s Hong Kong statement identified writedowns in its exploration and production segment of almost 13.6 billion yuan, citing a reduction in oil and gas reserves and high operating and development costs at some fields. Impairment losses in chemicals and refining were 4.92 billion yuan and 1.9 billion yuan, respectively.
While the company reported a narrower loss on E&P using Chinese accounting standards, they widened using international standards, which the company said in a Hong Kong filing was hit by higher liquefied natural gas procurement costs and expenses related to the restructuring of the Sichuan-to-East China Natural Gas Pipeline Co.
“It just shows how difficult it was for Sinopec to make a profit in oil and gas production, even as oil prices were edging toward $60 a barrel,” said Anna Yu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at ICBC International Research Ltd. “Refining and chemicals are the backbone of Sinopec’s assets and those sectors will continue to benefit from China’s growing fuel demand.”
Sinopec also reported Sunday:
State-owned peer PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest oil and gas producer, said Thursday full-year profit tripled to 22.8 billion yuan. Cnooc Ltd., China’s top offshore oil and gas explorer, will probably report that earnings jumped about 50-fold last year when it announces results on March 29, according to estimates in a Bloomberg survey.

1442,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Noble Group Says Shareholders Risk Wipeout Should Plan Fail,"(Bloomberg) -- Embattled commodity trader Noble Group Ltd. issued a defense of its planned restructuring, saying that if shareholders vote down the plan, it will probably enter insolvency proceedings in the U.K. or file for liquidation and existing equity holders risk being wiped out.
“If the primary restructuring is not approved by shareholders, the board will have no option but to put the company into insolvency proceedings,” the Hong Kong-based company said in a statement, responding to queries from the Singapore exchange. At present, the plan agreed with creditors needs approval by a simple majority of shareholders, it said.
After a three-year crisis, the fate of the company -- once Asia’s largest commodity trader -- is hanging in the balance as it attempts to push through a deal that would hand control to senior creditors, about half of whom back the approach. The plan is fraught with risk, and comes against a backdrop of turbulence at the trader. Last week, Noble Group defaulted on its debt, was hit by two lawsuits and saw founder Richard Elman quit the board amid a disagreement about the restructuring proposal. Its bonds dropped.
“As matters stand, the company is currently in default on certain of its debt obligations,” it said. The support of senior creditors and banks is “dependent on a successful restructuring. In the absence of such support and a successful restructuring, the company would no longer be a going concern.”
Noble Group outlined three possible routes that the company may take in the months ahead, depending on the approvals that it manages to get from shareholders and creditors. Elman’s role in that process will likely be decisive as he remains the top shareholder with a stake of about 18 percent.
Noble Group’s bonds have come under renewed pressure. Last week, the 2018 notes plunged 7.5 cents on the dollar, while the 2022s were down 6.6, the biggest fall since early June for both securities, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. On Monday, its shares extended losses, cutting the company’s market value to $91 million.
As the crisis unfolded, Noble Group has followed a shrink-to-survive strategy, selling off assets to pay down debts, and retreating back to its Asian roots in coal trading. As Elman quit last week, he trimmed his stake in a small but symbolic move: the founder has sold shares only once previously in the company’s history, he testified in a court case last year.
“The board’s strong preference is for a consensual transaction among the various classes of the capital structure,” it said. “The preference arises because a consensual restructuring, via the primary restructuring, is likely to result in better returns to stakeholders as a whole than a non-consensual restructuring, via the alternative restructuring, or liquidation.”

1443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 09:32PM ET</span>",Rio Sees $5 Billion Copper Expansion on Track Amid Swiss Probe,"(Bloomberg) --  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group has yet to be contacted by Swiss authorities over a bribery investigation related to Mongolia’s giant Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine and the site’s $5.3 billion expansion remains on track, according to the producer’s top executive.
The attorney general of Switzerland is examining whether the world’s second-biggest mining company paid bribes in the development of the project, the Office of the Attorney General said last week by email. The office also opened criminal proceedings against a former Mongolian finance minister on suspicion of bribery and money laundering, it said.
London-based Rio, its Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. unit and other partners are advancing an expansion aimed at more than doubling output at Oyu Tolgoi, targeting an eventual rate of more than 500,000 metric tons of copper a year.
“We have had no contact whatsoever. We have not been engaged, either ourselves or Turquoise Hill, by the Swiss authorities,” Rio’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing.
Reports have indicated the allegations relate to a period before Rio’s 2010 decision to take over management of the project and before it boosted its stake in the mine’s then-owner Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Jacques said. “We shouldn’t forget it was a time when Rio Tinto had less than a 10 percent equity stake in what was called at the time Ivanhoe, which is now Turquoise Hill,” he said.
The investment by Rio and partners in Oyu Tolgoi “was ratified by the Mongolian parliament, and therefore is totally valid,” Jacques, who visited the site in January, said in the interview Saturday. “The project is progressing very, very well and is already providing significant benefit to the Mongolian economy. ”
Turquoise Hill said this month it has been asked for information by Mongolia’s Anti-Corruption Authority over an inquiry into the possible abuse of power by “authorized officials” during the 2009 negotiations over investments in Oyu Tolgoi.
Rio is also assisting authorities in three countries over a $10.5 million payment made to an external consultant in 2011 over the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Separately, U.S. authorities have filed fraud charges against the company and two former executives saying they inflated the value of Mozambique coal assets acquired in 2011. Rio and the ex-executives deny the allegations.
A dedicated team on the fifth-floor of Rio’s London headquarters is handling the company’s response to the Mozambique and Guinea investigations, Jacques said. “We can ring-fence the rest of the organization so we can work on the future,” he said.
Coal Exit
The producer’s almost completed exit from the coal industry -- with a sale pending of Rio’s final mine in Australia’s Queensland-state -- is aimed at prioritizing iron ore, copper, bauxite and aluminum operations, according to Jacques. Rio continues to see coking coal, used alongside iron ore as a raw material in steel production, as potentially an attractive industry over the longer term, he said.
“It’s about portfolio management,” he said. “We have to make some choices and we have decided to invest in those commodities.” Rio has completed sales of about $6.5 billion of coal assets since 2014, including a $1.7 billion deal struck last week with  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 07:47AM ET</span>",World stocks bounce on report of U.S.-China trade talks,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks came off six-week lows and U.S. stock futures jumped on Monday on optimism that the United States and China are set to begin negotiations on trade, easing fears about a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, touched its lowest level since Feb. 9 but was then buoyed to a 0.25 percent gain after a Wall Street Journal report that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was considering a visit to Beijing to begin negotiations. 
U.S. stock futures shot up across the board, with Dow Futures (1YMc1) up 1.2 percent while S&P futures (ESc1) and Nasdaq futures (NQc1) up 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.
""Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners (Canada, Mexico, EU), which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war,"" wrote Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, noting a ""measured"" and ""nuanced"" response from China so far. 
Most European stock indices also strengthened, with the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark (STOXX) up nearly half a percent and the export-sensitive German DAX (GDAXI) up 0.6 percent. 
Japan's Nikkei, (N225) meanwhile, erased earlier losses of 1.3 percent to end 0.7 percent higher. 
Fears of a trade war mounted this month after Trump first slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and then on Thursday specifically targeted China by announcing plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. 
Signs of potential compromises were also supported by news overnight that South Korea would be exempt from U.S. steel tariffs in a revision of the bilateral trade pact between the two countries. 
South Korea's benchmark share index (KS11) rose 0.8 percent.
DOLLAR BOUNCE
The dollar also bounced off a 16-month low against the Japanese yen  but remained close to a one-month low against a basket of currencies (DXY), suggesting that fears have not receded completely. 
Safe-haven government bonds yields, which have been compressed in recent times by worries over a potential trade war, firmed on Tuesday with U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) rising 2 basis points and euro zone bond yields also edging higher. 
Concerns over the formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy weighed on Southern European debt in particular on Monday, though this was counterbalanced to an extent by a ratings upgrade for Spain late on Friday. 
Italian bonds underperformed, with 10-year yields (IT10YT=RR) rising as much as 4 basis points on further signs that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government. 
But the euro (EUR=) was still on a positive trajectory, up half a percent to a 2-1/2 week high of $1.2417. 
In commodities, international Brent crude futures  opened above $70 a barrel for the first time since January.
In a sign that jitters are still running through the market, spot gold was hovering around five-week highs  and was up slightly at $1,348.69 an ounce.

The conglomerate agreed last year to sell the world's second-biggest producer of NAND flash memory chips to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital to plug a financial hole left by the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit.
It had faced a March 23 deadline to win approval from antimonopoly authorities to sell the business by March 31, but China has not yet given its approval.
In a statement, Toshiba said it had yet to confirm regulatory approval from all authorities, without naming China.
""We do not yet know when the transfer will be completed, but we will continue to aim for the sale soon,"" Toshiba said. A spokesman said the company had not yet given up on closing the deal by the end of this month.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said last week antitrust approval must come by early this week to meet the deadline.
Toshiba no longer faces immediate insolvency or a delisting even if it does not meet the end-March deadline, as it raised funds from a share issue late last year.
Missing the deadline for the sale of the chip unit to the Bain consortium would give Toshiba the option of walking away without penalties, people briefed on the matter said.

Some activist shareholders oppose the sale saying that the $18 billion price tag undervalues the business and Toshiba should renegotiate with the Bain group or consider an IPO.

NORTH CHARLESTON S.C. (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) delivered its first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) on Sunday, rounding out a family of lightweight jets on which the U.S. planemaker is betting its future.
The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.
Goh called it a ""beautiful aircraft"" and an ""unparalleled product for regional operations.""
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.
Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models. 
The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.
Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.
The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.
The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the-air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long-distance flight. 
The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kilometers). 
At 223 feet long (68 meters), the aircraft is 18 feet (5.5 meters) longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.
Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.
Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide-body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.
But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.
The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.
The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.
The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.
Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines (O:AAL), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's pharmaceuticals business, among the pillars of the city-state's manufacturing sector, is set to return to strength this year as big global drugmakers ramp up output and advance automation at their production sites across the country.
A recovery from dismal 2017, which marked the sector's worst contraction in two decades, would underpin Singapore's economic growth. Pharmaceuticals is the No.2 contributor to the country's manufacturing output and accounts for 3 percent of its GDP.
The sector will see a ""robust"" 2018, Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) told Reuters.
""The opening of new sites like AbbVie's (N:ABBV) biologics manufacturing facility and the ramp up of others including Amgen (O:AMGN) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) reflect strong fundamentals ... we expect the manufacturing activity to remain robust for 2018,"" said Ho Weng Si, director of biomedical sciences for EDB.
""Outlook for the industry as a whole remains positive for the next few years,"" Ho added, citing the pace of new drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that hit a 21-year high in 2017.
Singapore is well placed to benefit from this uptick in approvals as it hosts facilities of eight of the world's top 10 drugmakers - such as Roche (S:ROG), GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY). 
Sanofi, which in Singapore mainly produces ingredients for blood-thinning drugs shipped globally, told Reuters it expects production ""to be relatively stable to slightly increasing in coming years"" as it invests to upgrade capacity.
A quarterly EDB survey of the manufacturing sector shows the pharmaceuticals industry is the most optimistic about production over January-March, with a net weighted balance of 56 percent of firms expecting output to rise from the preceding three months.
EDB's Ho and the survey did not provide a specific forecast.
Data for January shows pharmaceutical production dropped, albeit at a milder pace. Output shrank 15.6 percent in 2017, the largest annual contraction since at least 1993.
Singapore's pharmaceutical output has risen more than three-fold since the start of this century, with the sector generating S$17 billion ($13 billion) worth of products last year. 
(For a graphic on 'Singapore's pharmaceuticals output coming off a weak year' click http://reut.rs/2FZ60ms)
ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY, AUTOMATION 
The outlook for recovery, however, is not free of headwinds.
Output in pharmaceuticals is inherently volatile because production happens in batches, which can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to make.
But thanks to advancements in technology, industry players are hoping to achieve more consistent production levels.
GSK, which has been manufacturing in Singapore for nearly 50 years, has been pioneering a technology called continuous manufacturing where instead of making products in batches, materials are constantly added and products removed. 
Last year, for the first time products were commercially made using this technology.
""The pharma industry has to progress on the technology front ... to ensure we increase productivity,"" said Lim Hock Heng, a site director in Singapore for GSK.
Mundipharma hopes to start commercial production of antiseptics at its new plant in Singapore as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 - which according to CEO Raman Singh ""will be the most automated plant in the world compared to any other competitors"".

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>","Chinese airlines tipped for record profits on tourism boom, yuan gains","By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's three largest airlines are likely to report their strongest annual profits in years this week, as soaring travel demand and foreign exchange gains more than make up for a drop in income-per-passenger and the rising cost of fuel.
Analysts estimate China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) (HK:1055), the country's largest carrier by passenger numbers, will report net income on Monday of about 6.4 billion yuan ($1.01 billion), its highest in 11 years as a listed firm, showed data from Thomson Reuters.
Later in the week,  Air China  Ltd (SS:601111) (HK:0753) is expected to report its biggest profit since 2010, and China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (SS:600115) (HK:0670) is forecast to book its best result since at least 1996.
Driving profit is a tourism boom which saw more than 5 billion domestic trips made last year, 12.8 percent over 2016, plus 129 million overseas trips, up 5.7 percent, showed data from the China National Tourism Administration.
Foreign exchange gains are also likely to add ""a few billion yuan"" to each carrier's earnings, analysts said. The yuan  has risen about 10 percent in value against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2017. This has helped cut the cost of financing aircraft purchases with dollar-denominated loans.
""(Profits) are likely to be very strong,"" said Daiwa Securities analyst Kelvin Lau in Hong Kong. ""But the major focus will be more on how the yields - especially now with fuel costs coming up - can mitigate cost impact.""
The rate at which the airlines have bought planes and opened less-profitable international routes has outpaced passenger growth, impacting returns. China Southern, for instance, reported a passenger yield of 0.50 yuan per revenue passenger kilometer in 2016, from 0.67 yuan in 2011.
As of June, the three carriers had a combined fleet of owned and leased aircraft of 1,924 planes, from 1,868 at the same time a year earlier. International routes opened last year include Guangzhou-Vientiane and Shanghai-Cebu.
Rising prices of jet fuel, airlines' single largest cost, is also eating into profits. As of March 16, the price has risen 28 percent year-on-year to $78.2 per barrel, showed the International Air Transport Association's jet fuel price monitor.

AT&T squared off with the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday in a long anticipated antitrust trial, as the two sides disputed whether the company's purchase of Time Warner would be good for consumers or an expensive drag on innovation.
Time Warner's stock price ended Friday around $11 below AT&T's bid price of $103.60 a share, Barron's said.
""That's a 12 percent spread, which is appealing, given that many observers see AT&T prevailing over the U.S. government and completing their merger around mid-year,"" the financial newspaper said.
Even if the government ends up winning and the deal dies, Time Warner shares might fall $5, but some analysts think they would quickly recover to their current value, given the company's earnings power, Barron's said.
Time Warner investors could end up even better off if the deal does not go through because the company's earnings power could support a higher stock price than the deal's current value, the newspaper said. It added that a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst has a 12-month price target of $120 for the company on a stand-alone basis. 

The antitrust trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.

The social media site said that when the feature is enabled by the user and contact information is uploaded, the platform can then use the given data when a call or text was made or received with Facebook Lite and Facebook Messenger services.
Facebook specified that it does not collect the content of calls or text messages and information is securely stored. This data is not sold to third parties, Facebook's statement said.
""You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people's call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,"" Facebook's statement said.
The Verge website reported that some Twitter users said they found months or years of call history data in their downloadable Facebook data file. Ars Technica reported Facebook requested access to contacts, SMS data and call history on Android devices to improve its friend recommendation algorithm.
""Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only,"" the world's largest social media network said.
""People have to expressly agree to use this feature,"" the statement said.
The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on Friday wrote to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg detailing new concerns about the social media company's use of data and formally requesting that he testify at a hearing.

Facebook is under pressure from governments, investors and advertisers following allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>",Booming online luxury goods sales convert watchmakers to the web,"By Sarah White and Silke Koltrowitz
BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - A boom in online luxury goods sales is finally convincing high-end watchmakers, long skeptical that customers would pay thousands to buy intricate timepieces on the web, to step up their investments in e-commerce. 
Courting younger shoppers, brands large and small are joining an online push sweeping the luxury goods world, where web sales are already major growth drivers for fashion labels. 
""We didn't realize the speed at which millennials would take to buying cars or watches online,"" said Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) watch business, in an interview at the Baselworld watch trade fair. 
LVMH's Tag Heuer, a label long associated with motor racing, is looking to fully build out its own shoppable sites over the next 18 months, Biver added. Tag already operates online stores in five countries including the United States and Britain, and has a partnership in China with JD.com (O:JD), the company said.
LVMH sister brands Hublot and Zenith are yet to follow suit. 
Many watchmakers have flirted with web sales, though often through one-off collaborations with multi-brand web retailers. 
Tech-savvy shoppers in Asia have partly inspired a drive to do more - China overtook the United States last year as the leading source of traffic to luxury watch websites, according to consultancy DLG. 
And watchmakers have reasons to take control of their online image, as websites run by unofficial resellers proliferate. 
""We want to reassure people, while taking into account that today clients also might like to buy their watch at home in the evening while they drink a glass of wine,"" said Jerome Biard, chief executive of Corum, owned by China's Citychamp (HK:0256).
The Swiss brand's first e-commerce site will be fully operational in about two months, Biard said. 
NO TABOOS
Web sales are expected to make up a quarter of all global luxury goods sales by 2025, up from around 9 percent last year, consultancy Bain & Co projects. 
There are notable holdouts - France's Chanel shuns e-commerce for its coveted clothing, quilted handbags or watches. 
Watchmaker Rolex, owned by a private foundation, is not known to have any plans to build its own online shop.
But others are stumping up serious cash, betting on online growth.  Richemont  (S:CFR), owner of Cartier and Baume & Mercier, is offering up to 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for full control of multi-brand site Yoox Net-a-Porter (MI:YNAP).
""There is no taboo with buying online anymore,"" said Anish Bhatt, a watch enthusiast with 1.7 million followers on Instagram who works with brands such as Rolex, Richard Mille and Chopard on social media campaigns. 
Watchmakers were long hobbled by the perception sales could only happen in a certain environment, with ""shop assistants wearing silk gloves, while you sipped champagne,"" Bhatt added. 
PRICE LIMITS?
Independent Swiss watchmaker Oris, Breitling, now owned by private equity firm CVC, and RJ, formerly known as Romain Jerome, have also confirmed plans to expand online operations. 
The push still comes with caveats and limitations, however. 
""There are watch adjustments that require customers to pass through a store,"" said Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of LVMH's Italian jeweler and watchmaker Bulgari.
Bulgari already sells through its sites in the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom, and is rolling out e-commerce to all of Europe by year-end. It aims to launch in Australia early in 2019.
Bulgari sees 30,000-40,000 euros as the ceiling for the kind of watches it would sell online, Babin added.

Yet even those boundaries may one day shift. Mr Porter, a men's style site run by Yoox Net-A-Porter, this week launched the sale of its most expensive item yet, a $480,000 watch made of sapphire by French label Bell & Ross.

Grupo Comercial Chedraui (MX:CHDRAUIB), as the company is formally know, announced the acquisition of Texas-based Fiesta Marts' 63 stores in a brief statement on Sunday, emphasizing how the deal will strengthen its reach with Mexican-American shoppers.
A Chedraui official did not immediately respond to calls seeking additional details on the acquisition. 
Chedraui, based in Veracruz state, already runs 59 El Super grocery stores, mostly in California but also in other southwestern U.S. states, where shoppers are courted with Spanish-language ads promising the lowest price.
Burt Flickinger, a grocery sector consultant with Strategic Resource Group, said the acquisition will likely make the company the top retailer for Spanish-speaking shoppers in the United States, besting even retail giants like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) for the coveted demographic.
""El Super is (already) a fierce winner in the wars in the stores, he said, referring to the chain's dominance with Latino consumers.
The group is the fastest growing consumer constituency in the United States, he added.
Chedraui made the purchase of Fiesta Marts through its U.S. unit, Bodega Latina, and while the company's statement did not provide a final price tag, it did say the acquisition reflects 0.2 percent of the firm's projected 2018 sales and 6.6 percent of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EDITDA) for the year. 
In Mexico, Chedraui operated 170 stores as of the end of last year.
The company said earlier this year it expects to invest around 3.8 percent of its consolidated revenue in assets, which it said should see sales growth reach as high as 6 percent in 2018.

Chedraui's sales growth totaled 3.3 percent last year.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",Wall Street's beloved FANG stock quartet may be breaking up,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The quartet of technology stocks that has driven Wall Street indices to record highs in recent years may be breaking up, possibly undermining one of the best growth stories in a nine-year bull market.
Facebook (O:FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) tumbled this week as the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) fell back toward lows seen in February, when the index gave back more than 10 percent in 10 days after reaching a record high in January. 
Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN), which along with Facebook and Alphabet make up the so-called ""FANG"" stocks, did not do as badly as the S&P 500 index this week, falling 4.0 percent, compared to the index's 6.0 per cent fall. 
But growing concerns about potential government regulation in the U.S. and Europe in response to privacy issues have investors assessing whether they may be forced to choose between those technology stocks leading the new economy.
""The big, consumer-facing tech companies have been stock market leaders for years, and this could be the beginning of the end of that leadership. However, the long-term tech growth story is far from over,"" Guild Investment Management Executive Vice President Tim Shirata wrote in a note this week. 
The outcry over Facebook's handling of users' data this week has bled $75 billion from the social media company's stock market value, with concerns about potential regulation of internet companies also hurting Alphabet. 
Facebook fell 13 percent for the week and is down nearly 20 percent from its record high, while Alphabet lost nearly 10 percent this week and is 14 percent off its record high. 
Amazon lost nearly 10 percent also for the week but is only 8 percent off its record, while Netflix lost 5.4 percent and is nearly 10 percent from its high. 
Apple (O:AAPL), which became a stock portfolio cornerstone following the iPhone's debut in 2007, is also about 10 percent off its record high. 
Amazon this week overtook Alphabet as the world's second largest company by market capitalization at around $747 billion compared to $730 billion for Alphabet, but is still behind the largest company Apple worth $860 billion, according to Reuters data. 
""The FANG complex needs to go away,"" said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush. ""You can't compare Facebook and Google to Amazon anymore because they're going in different directions and disrupting different parts of the world.""
Illustrative of the consumer and political backlash against Facebook, the world's largest social media network, the verified Facebook page of rocket company SpaceX disappeared on Friday, minutes after its founder and Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk promised on Twitter to take down the page when challenged by a user.
Since February 2013, when CNBC television host Jim Cramer popularized the term FANG to describe the four must-own stocks, each has provided massive rewards to investors, with Facebook and Amazon gaining over 400 percent, Netflix climbing over 1,000 percent, and Alphabet nearly tripling its stock price. 
STILL MOSTLY BULLISH
Criticism about the misuse of Facebook and Alphabet's platforms during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign has worried investors for several months.
European governments are already taking action to deal with risks to the privacy of user data, as well to limit what is seen as unfair competition in a move reminiscent of regulatory action against Microsoft (O:MSFT) nearly 20 years ago. 
Regulatory risk became a bigger issue this week after the revelation that Facebook mistakenly let 50 million users' data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Longer term though investors remain mostly bulllish on all four stocks and this week's privacy scandal has not led analysts to meaningfully change their expectations for Facebook or Alphabet's stocks. 
Investors disagree about which FANG stocks will lead in the future. 
Gullane Capital Partners, a hedge fund in Memphis, Tennessee, owns Amazon and Alphabet, and has occasionally shorted Netflix in recent years, betting the streaming company's meteoric rise would be followed by a steep pullback.
""I want to own Amazon for the next 25 years. It's the most powerful business since Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Microsoft in their heydays,"" said Gullane Capital Managing Partner Trip Miller. 
Miller attributed recent selling in Facebook, which his fund does not own, more to profit-taking than to a seismic change in how the company is viewed on Wall Street. 
The growing divergence in views on the four Wall Street powerhouses comes as investors more broadly reduce their appetite for the technology stocks which have led Wall Street's rally in recent years. 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) on Friday slumped 3.3 percent, hammered by fears of a trade war with China after President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods.
In the latest week ended Wednesday March 21, U.S.-based technology sector funds attracted just $158 million of net new cash, down sharply from inflows of $1.95 billion the previous week, according to Lipper data on Thursday. 
Guild Investment Management's Shirata recommends buying technology stocks less likely to catch the eye of government regulators, and he pointed to networking, videogames and cloud computing companies.

SAN FRANCISCO/LONDON (Reuters) - Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany indicated that a majority of the public were losing trust in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over privacy, as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users.
Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.
Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for ""a breach of trust"" in advertisements placed in papers including the Observer in Britain and the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. 
""We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it,"" said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo.
The world's largest social media network is coming under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States, and is trying to repair its reputation among users, advertisers, lawmakers and investors.
This follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users' information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.
U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press"" on Sunday that Facebook had not been ""fully forthcoming"" over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data.
Warner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront “the dark underbelly of social media” and how it can be manipulated.
""BREACH OF TRUST""
Zuckerberg acknowledged that an app built by a university researcher had ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"". 
""This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Zuckerberg said, reiterating an apology first made last week in U.S. television interviews.
Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week, while the hashtag #DeleteFacebook gained traction online.
The Reuters/Ipsos online poll found that 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information, compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), 62 percent who trust Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, 60 percent for  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2,237 responses. (https://reut.rs/2G9hvrv)
The German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID, a unit of global advertising holding company WPP (LON:WPP), using representative polling methods, the firm said. Overall, only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy, against 60 percent who believed the opposite.
It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook, eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said in an interview. Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith, she said. 
""It's psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that's become pretty well ingrained into people's lives,"" she said. 
Data supplied to Reuters by the Israeli firm SimilarWeb, which measures global online audiences, indicated that Facebook usage in major markets and worldwide remained steady over the past week.

""Desktop, mobile and app usage has remained steady and well within the expected range,"" said Gitit Greenberg, SimilarWeb's director of market insights. ""It is important to separate frustration from actual tangible impacts to Facebook usage.""

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",Aldi and Lidl dig deeper into Britain's grocery market,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - German-owned discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are plowing ahead with a rapid expansion in Britain and are on course to grab more market share from the traditional big four players.
A top Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] executive told Reuters it aimed to have 1,000 UK stores by 2022, up from its current 762 while Lidl said it sees potentially 1,200 to 1,500 stores in the long term, up from 710. 
Meanwhile, store openings at market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) have slowed to a trickle. They are shedding thousands of jobs so they can save money and better compete with the discounters.
Aldi and Lidl's cut-price model have turned them into two of the world's biggest retailers. They have expanded abroad as growth stagnated at home. 
Aldi launched in Britain in 1994 and Lidl in 1990 and they have changed the shape of the UK grocery market.
But their profits have fallen and traditional retailers have questioned whether the model is sustainable. The discounters also have little presence online and could face competition there from the big four and grocery newcomers such as Amazon (O:AMZN). 
For now, Aldi and Lidl's combined share of the 200 billion pound ($283 billion) UK grocery market is set to grow. It will be 15 percent by 2020, up from 12.1 percent currently, according to Ashley Anzie, strategic insight director for grocery at researcher Kantar Worldpanel. 
""That's largely driven by the fact that Aldi and Lidl will just physically be opening more stores,"" he said.
Aldi and Lidl are also modernizing existing stores and making a push into premium ranges that chimes with British shoppers, who, squeezed by inflation and subdued wages growth, have become more cautious in their spending.
""What we're doing is investing very carefully in things that add to our customer offer, our store portfolio, our infrastructure,"" Jonathan Neale, Aldi Managing Director Buying, told Reuters.
Aldi's 1 billion pounds investment program to the end of 2018 will create 8,000 jobs. Britain's departure from the European Union had not changed the company's plans, Neale said.
This year 70 new stores will be opened and by 2020 some 850 stores will have Aldi's updated format, from 138 currently, Neale said.
Lidl is investing 1.45 billion pounds in Britain across 2017-18. It plans to open 50 stores and re-vamp 30 this year. 
""To further strengthen our position as a British retailer, we will continue to invest in our UK expansion,"" said Christian Härtnagel, Lidl UK's CEO.
CATCHING UP
Though Britain's big four have narrowed the price gap with the discounters they have not reversed the trend.
Tesco and Morrisons have reported annual profit growth but that’s partly because their profits were re-based after huge restructurings in 2014. Sainsbury’s has reported three straight years of profit decline and a fourth is forecast by analysts. Asda has seen two years of falls. 
Over the last year Sainsbury's and Morrisons shares have fallen 15 percent and 12 percent respectively. Tesco's shares are up 6 percent but are still below the level they were when Dave Lewis took over as chief executive in 2014.
They are hoping to compete by broadening their businesses. Sainsbury's purchased general merchandise retailer Argos in 2016, Morrisons has struck wholesale deals with Amazon and McColl's (L:MCLSM), and Tesco has just spent 4 billion pounds buying wholesaler Booker (L:BOK).
One senior director of a big four player said the discounters price position was unsustainable. 
""The underlying brand equity proposition isn't actually there, it's just that they are giving it away below economic rational behavior,"" the director said. 
Nevertheless, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's have all dabbled with their own discount formats, without success. Tesco is reportedly considering having another go, utilizing Booker's assets. Tesco declined to comment on its intentions.
Aldi, owned by Germany's Aldi Sud, the world's No. 5 retailer, has a 7 percent share of the British market, according to Kantar data. Lidl, part of Germany's Schwarz group, the world's second biggest retailer behind Walmart, has a 5.1 percent share. 
ONLINE PRESSURE 
The German groups are active in dozens of countries which gives them a purchasing power advantage over local rivals. This means they can offer low prices on a range limited to 1,500-1,800 of mostly own-brand products.
Aldi says it offers a 15 percent price discount to the market ""regardless of what the market does"".
But this has squeezed its operating margins.
It earned 5.10 pence of operating profit for every pound customers spent in 2013. By 2016 it had fallen to 2.42 pence in the pound, with total operating profit down 17 percent to 211.3 million pounds. Analysts believe it likely also fell in 2017.
Lidl does not disclose its UK profitability but analysts estimate its operating margins to have been on a similar trajectory. 
Aldi and Lidl say they can afford to take a long-term approach as, being privately-owned, they are not beholden to shareholders, unlike their big four competitors. 
""We're not fixated on a particular point on the horizon where we have to report a certain set of statistics,"" said Neale.
One longer-term threat to Aldi and Lidl's model could come from ecommerce, where the British supermarkets are trailblazers. The German companies have not embraced ecommerce but Amazon’s entry into selling food online could mean they also have to follow suit.

GM plans to shut down its Gunsan plant by May and almost 2,500 workers, or about 15 percent of the staff, have applied for the redundancy package offered as part of a restructuring of its operations.
The death of the 47-year-old worker in his home was reported to police around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, and the suspected suicide is being investigated, a police official said.
If proven, it would be the first suicide reported from the plant ahead of the planned shutdown.
A spokesman for GM Korea said it was also looking into the case. 
In March, GM's South Korean union did not demand a pay rise and bonuses for the first time during annual wage talks, but instead asked it to provide a future production plan and job security.

The firm has proposed a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year, besides a suspension of some worker benefits, including school tuition for employees' children.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Almost a month after a deadly earthquake, Papua New Guinea is struggling to get aid to desperate survivors, having allocated just a fraction of its relief funds, while a rent dispute left disaster officials briefly locked out of their offices.
The scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world's poorest countries, disaster and relief officials say, after the magnitude 7.5 quake rocked its remote mountainous highlands on Feb. 26, killing 100 people. 
(For a graphic on 'Papua New Guinea quake' click http://tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR)
Thousands of survivors have walked to remote airstrips and jungle clearings, awaiting helicopters bringing supplies of food, water and medicines, aid agencies and authorities say.
""To date, we do not have any money to do all the necessary things,"" Tom Edabe, the disaster coordinator for the hardest-hit province of Hela, said by telephone from Tari, its capital.
""(The) government is trying to assist and have budgeted some money, but to date we have not received anything...we have only been given food, and non-food items supplied by other NGOs.""
Continuing aftershocks rattle residents, who have to collect water brought by daily rainstorms to ensure adequate supplies, Edabe, the disaster coordinator, said.
""The biggest thing that people need, apart from food, is water,"" said James Pima, a helicopter pilot and flight manager at aviation firm HeliSolutions in the Western Highlands capital of Mt. Hagen, about 170 km (100 miles) from the disaster zone. 
""They don't have clean water to cook or drink ... they are standing there staring. The expression on their faces is blank.""
His firm's three helicopters fly relief missions ""fully flat-out every day,"" Pima added.
Destruction to roads and runways means authorities must rely on helicopters to fly in relief. But while nimble, the craft can only carry smaller loads than fixed-wing aircraft and cannot fly during the afternoon thunderstorms.
The logistics problems wind all the way to PNG's disaster center, where officials told Reuters they had been locked out of their office in Port Moresby, the capital, for two days last week after the government missed a rental payment.
""That was correct, Monday and Tuesday,"" a spokeswoman said.
In a joint report with the United Nations published on Friday, the agency cited ""lack of quality data"" about food shortages, limited aircraft assets and ""significant gaps"" in sanitation support as being the biggest problems it faced. 
The office of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill did not respond to emailed questions from Reuters.
On his website, O'Neill has previously said, ""There will be no quick fix, the damage from this disaster will take months and years to be repaired.""
'POLITICAL GAMES'
The government had approved relief funds amounting to 450 million kina ($130 million), O'Neill said initially, but a later statement mentioned only 3 million kina in initial relief - or less than 1 percent - had been allocated to the worst-hit areas.
In its November budget, the government made plans to rein in spending and trim debt projected to stand at 25.8 billion kina in 2018.
The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Corp's liquefied natural gas project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.
O'Neill last week hit out at critics of the aid effort for playing ""political games,"" while thanking Australia and New Zealand for military aircraft that provided assistance beyond the capacity of PNG's own defense forces.
His political opponent, former Prime Minister Mekere Morauta, had called the government's response ""tardy"" and inadequate.
""Relief sources say mobile medical centers and operating theaters are needed urgently, and that only international partners can supply them,"" Morauta said last week.
Foreign aid pledges of about $49 million have come in from Australia, China, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, says the United Nations, most of it provided by private companies.
Exxon and its partner, Oil Search Ltd, say they have provided $6 million in cash and kind for quake relief.
Local officials say the scale of destruction, with villages buried by landslides and provincial towns flattened, has overwhelmed authorities in Papua New Guinea, which straddles the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire.
""Policemen are still struggling because there is no support flying in and out,"" said Naring Bongi of the quake-damaged police station in the Southern Highlands capital of Mendi. 
""There is not enough food to supply care centers, they need fresh water,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Japanese machinery makers with heavy exposure to China plummeted on Friday as China and the United States moved closer to a trade war that could damage global growth.
Shares in machinery makers, which account for 20 percent of Japan's total exports, had enjoyed strong gains in the past year on the back of brisk demand for investment in electronics and semiconductors in China, Japan's biggest trading partner.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that will target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs to kick in after a 30-day consultation period. The tariffs would target sectors including technology.
""Responding to rising demand for tech products in China, Japan's capital goods makers and machinery makers had seen strong exports so they are likely to hit hard from now,"" said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
The Tokyo machinery sector index <.IMCHN.T> slumped 5.6 percent, helping to pull the Nikkei share average (N225) down 4.5 percent.
Machine tool makers were hammered, with Makino Milling Machine (T:6135) sliding 6.1 percent, Okuma Corp (T:6103) nose-diving 7.4 percent and DMG Mori Co (T:6141) stumbling 6.0 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, Makino has fallen 15 percent, while Okuma and DMG Mori have both sunk around 20 percent.
The Cabinet Office last week said it expects a 3.1 percent drop in Japan's exports, the first decline in a year.
""For the Japanese economy which relies heavily on external demand amid weak domestic demand, this signals an end to strong exports,"" said Toru Suehiro, a senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Friday's big losers included semiconductor equipment makers Advantest (T:6857) and Tokyo Electron 8035.T dropped 4.1 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. 
High-purity silicon maker Sumco Corp (T:3436) also shed 5.0 percent and silicon products maker Shin-Etsu Chemical Co <4063.> tumbled 6.7 percent.
Construction equipment maker Komatsu (T:6301) tumbled 6.3 percent.

Prime Minister Youssef Chahed told parliament on Friday that he wanted to restructure and possibly sell public companies that have been posting losses for years.
UGTT chief Noureddine Taboubi rejected the move as he addressed a rally in the seaside town of Sousse south of Tunis, saying the union was ready for a showdown with the government.
""The sale of public companies is a red line and we will deal with this dangerous plan,"" he told hundreds of gathered workers chanting slogans against privatizations.
""We will organize large workers' gatherings in all regions of the country culminating with a large protest in the capital."" He did not say when such protests would be held.
The North African country is in the midst of an economic crisis and under pressure from foreign donors to cut a bloated public service and a budget deficit.
Tourism revenue has resurged in recent months as Tunisia has not suffered any serious Islamist militant attack since 2015.
But economic growth remains weak due to the reluctance of investors to come to a country in frequent turmoil since the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will consider partially privatizing struggling state-owned companies as part of wide-ranging reforms set in motion by President Cyril Ramaphosa since he came to power last month, the head of the National Treasury said on Saturday.
Dondo Mogajane said South Africa was at the end of a credit downgrade cycle after Moody's held its investment-grade rating and raised its outlook on Friday, partly because of Ramaphosa's plan to reform state companies. 
""For me, I see it as the end,"" Mogajane told Reuters in an interview.
""Moody's are saying there are things we can do and these are the things we will be focused on,"" he added, highlighting plans to stabilize debt, revamp state firms and boost growth in sectors such as agriculture and tourism.
A downgrade to a ""junk"" rating by Moody's would have seen South Africa removed from Citi's World Government Bond Index, and could have triggered up to 100 billion rand ($9 billion) in asset sales by foreign investors.
Investors have cheered Ramaphosa's arrival and his choice of respected ministers in key roles, including former finance minister Pravin Gordhan as minister of public enterprises.
Gordhan is tasked with turning around state companies that have plunged public finances into crisis in recent years, including heavily indebted power utility Eskom and South African Airways (SAA), which is on the brink of bankruptcy.
""Why not?"" Mogajane said when asked if it was possible parts of government-owned companies could be sold.
""There have to be new ways of looking at these things. Are we talking privatization? Are we talking equity partnership? Let's give an opportunity for new ministers to unpack what it means.""
Mogajane gave as theoretical examples the sale of 49 percent of SAA and of attracting private investors by splitting up the generation, transmission and distribution sections of Eskom, one the world's biggest power utilities.
His comments are likely to go down badly with powerful trade unions, sections of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters, a disruptive red-beret-wearing opposition party.
Ramaphosa is walking a tight rope as he seeks to win back the support of investors and voters who were disillusioned under former president Jacob Zuma while holding together a divided ANC ahead of an election next year that is likely to be the closest fought since the end of apartheid in 1994.
""All we can do is to offer the president all the support that we can to make sure South Africa goes on the other side of what has essentially been a downward spiral for the past few years,"" Mogajane said.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 09:22AM ET</span>","Apple's Tim Cook calls for calm heads on China, U.S. trade","BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's Chief Executive Tim Cook on Saturday called for ""calm heads"" and more open trade, amid rising fears of a trade war between the United States and China. 
Trade tension between China and the United States flared this week when President Donald Trump unveiled plans on Thursday to slap tariffs on potentially up to $60 billion in Chinese goods.
China's Commerce Ministry on Friday urged the United States to ""pull back from the brink"", saying it was not afraid to engage in a trade war.
""I'm cognizant that in both the U.S. and China, there have been cases where everyone hasn't benefited, where the benefit hasn't been balanced,"" Cook said.
Speaking at the annual China Development Forum in Beijing, Cook said he hoped ""calm heads"" would prevail.
The sparring has cast a spotlight on hardware makers such as Apple, which assemble the majority of their products in China for export to other countries. Electrical goods and tech are the largest U.S. import item from China.
In the past year, Apple and other foreign tech firms have grappled with a string of new regulatory requirements in China, including a controversial law requiring firms to house user data in data centers overseen by Chinese firms. 
Last month, Apple officially moved to store keys for its iCloud data in China, provoking intense criticism from rights groups who say the decision makes it easier for Chinese officials to tap and collect private data.
Despite challenges, the company has sought to expand its services in China, its third-largest market, where roughly 1.8 million developers use its platform.
""My belief is that businesses should be engaged with governments in countries where they are doing business, whether they agree or disagree,"" Cook said.
Cook has come to China several times in the past year, and was among executives who met Chinese President Xi Jinping last October.
""My belief is that one plus one equals three. The pie gets larger, working together,"" Cook said. 
Others attending the three-day forum include the chief executives of  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Group ,  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.

Cook, who this year co-chaired the event, also attended last year when he called for China to increase trade and continue opening itself up to the world.

The board said it would also reschedule the plans to transform the island's deficit for its power and water authorities, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Authority (PRASA). 
Asked about the reason for the decision, a spokesman said the board ""is continuing to work with the government on the details of the plans.""
The board is tasked with helping the U.S. territory manage its finances as it navigates the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, trying to shed $120 billion in bond and pension debt. 
Natalie Jaresko, who leads the oversight board's executive team, told Reuters she had expected the revised fiscal reform plans submitted by Puerto Rico's government to be certified on Monday.
Jaresko had highlighted three critical structural reform areas - the electrical grid, overseen by PREPA; labor market reforms; and making it easier to do business.
Puerto Rico's benchmark bond price hit a 22-week high earlier this week as creditors anticipated the approval of this plan at the board's scheduled meeting on Monday in San Juan. 

Governor Ricardo Rossello released a revised fiscal plan last month that would use $18 billion of additional money from the U.S. federal budget to help transform the island's deficit into a $3.4 billion surplus within six years.

Glenview, an $11 billion firm run by Larry Robbins, said in a regulatory filing it owns 26.9 million shares in Newell, up from 17 million shares owned at the end of 2017.
Robbins likes to call himself a ""suggestivist"" investor instead of an activist, preferring behind-the-scenes talks to issuing public demands. A spokesman for Robbins did not respond to a request for comment.
News of his bigger stake comes only days after the consumer products giant struck a deal with billionaire Carl Icahn, one of the industry's most demanding activists, who holds a 6.9 percent stake. By handing Icahn four board seats, including one to his son, Brett, Newell snubbed rival activist Starboard Value LP which had sought to oust the entire board. Icahn will also be allowed to designate another board member at the annual meeting.
The company has said it planned to expand its asset sales, and a former board member, Martin Franklin, said his company might be interested in buying some.

But investors showed concern about this week's developments, sending the stock down 10.6 percent for the week to close at $25.35.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Extent of U.S.-China trade fight depends on Trump's goals,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight get? That depends on whether President Donald Trump will settle for a reduction in China's U.S. trade surplus or hold out for sweeping changes to China's industrial policies.
After Trump's announcement on Thursday that he will impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods and impose investment restrictions on Beijing, it is far from clear what Trump's end game is, trade experts say.
Trump repeated on Thursday that he wants a $100 billion reduction in China's trade surplus, while his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said fundamental changes that allow U.S. companies to keep their technological edge over Chinese competitors were critical to the future of the U.S. economy. 
A deal for the latter will not come in the next 45 days before the yet-to-be published U.S. tariff list becomes effective.
""It's not clear what the Trump administration's bottom line is,"" said Scott Kennedy, the head of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
""We know what the Chinese bottom line is. They won't do anything to relent on their industrial policy system. They won't clip the wings of China Inc,"" he said.
Kennedy said a deal to cut China's $375 billion U.S. goods trade surplus by $100 billion is far easier to achieve with additional purchases of U.S. soybeans, beef, liquefied natural gas, Boeing (N:BA) aircraft and other equipment.
But fundamental changes such as joint venture requirements that often cannot be negotiated without technology transfers and industrial policies aimed at acquiring and investing in more U.S. technology firms will not come without significant protracted pressure on China - and economic pain for the United States.
""The Chinese will want to throw us a few bones and otherwise go back to the status quo. If you're talking about actually changing Chinese behavior, it's a long, painful process,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
It also would take a lot more than tariffs on $60 billion worth of exports from China to inflict significant pain on the government, Scissors said. 
China's goods exports to the United States rose by $43 billion in 2017 alone. And the U.S. demand for Chinese goods is expected to increase in the next few years as U.S. tax cuts boost growth and increase federal borrowing. 
So far, China's response to Trump's announcement has been muted. The Ministry of Commerce announced additional duties on up to $3 billion of imports from the United States, including fruit, nuts, pork, wine and seamless steel pipe. But these are technically responses to U.S. global steel and aluminum tariffs, not the Trump administration's anti-China tariffs over intellectual property practices.
China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, declined to rule out cutting purchases of U.S. Treasury debt in the dispute, telling Bloomberg Television on Friday: ""We are looking at all options.""
China owned $1.17 trillion in Treasuries at the end of January, compared with $14.8 trillion in total U.S. public debt, according to U.S. Treasury data. 
China has also hinted at cutting imports of U.S. soybeans, which totaled $12.4 billion in 2018 - the second largest U.S. export to China after commercial aircraft. 
But Beijing is likely waiting for Trump's final tariff list before it responds more fully. The list is expected to be published within two weeks, then subject to a 30-day comment period and potential revisions by the U.S. Trade Representative's office after that period ends.
A tit-for-tat escalation of trade retaliation, coupled with Trump's desire to ""look tough on China"" will make it harder for the two sides to settle their differences, said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China department. 

""The hardening stance on both sides, and an unclear game plan in terms of the objectives and end game the Trump administration is striving toward, makes negotiations even more complicated than otherwise,"" Prasad said.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",EPA decision to pave way for changes in fuel efficiency rules: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Administration plans to declare by April 1 that the Obama administration's vehicle efficiency rules through 2025 are ""not appropriate,"" two officials briefed on the matter said Friday.
The ""not appropriate"" declaration will allow the Trump administration to reopen vehicle emissions rules announced in 2011 and agreed to by automakers. 
The administration is considering significant changes that would make it easier for automakers to meet regulations, a move that could boost vehicle pollution.
The EPA is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but not immediately propose new requirements, the people said. The rules sought to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.
Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing revisions for automakers remained in flux. EPA officials suggested a proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said.
EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman confirmed in an email Friday that a draft determination submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget ""is undergoing interagency review. A final determination will be signed by April 1, 2018, consistent with the original timeline."" She declined to offer any details on the proposal.
Heidi King, the deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator, told a Senate panel Tuesday that the agency expected to propose fuel economy standards in April for a five-year period and is working ""to make sure that the federal family is aligned in the path forward.""
Car companies hope to avoid a potential legal battle among federal regulators, many state attorneys general and environmental groups that could leave them in limbo about future rules. General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra met earlier this month with EPA and Transportation officials.
Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011.
In March 2017, Trump suggested he would soften the mandates. ""The assault on the American auto industry is over,"" he told autoworkers.
Automakers are pressing the administration to reach agreement with California to maintain a nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements.
California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered.
A spokeswoman for Nichols, Stanley Young, said the agency was “troubled about the rumors that the EPA has found the standards to be too aggressive and that they need to be weakened.”

He added California feels ""strongly that weakening the program will waste fuel, increase emissions, and cost consumers more money.”

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Boeing set to win American wide-body jet order: sources,"By Tim Hepher and Alana Wise
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is close to winning a keenly fought contest to supply 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines (O:AAL), beating European competition from the Airbus (PA:AIR) A330neo, three people familiar with the matter said.
The deal, which remains to be finalised, also marks a victory for  General Electric  (N:GE), whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft, beating proposals from rival Rolls-Royce (L:RR), they said, asking not to be identified.
""We are continuing to look at our wide-body options and are focused on making the right decision for American. No final decisions have been made at this time,"" an American spokesman said.
Other parties declined to comment.
Shares of American Airlines closed down 2.5 percent, while shares of Boeing were up 0.4 percent.
Boeing's expected win deals a fresh blow to the struggling A330neo, weeks after Hawaiian Airlines dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favor of the 787, leaving that particular variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers.
Airbus updated its profitable A330 series in 2014 with new Rolls-Royce engines, but after an initial foray, sales have been sluggish.
Recently appointed sales chief Eric Schulz has made boosting A330neo sales a top priority this year.
American Airlines (O:AAL) said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A330-900neo, which is in test flights before entering service this summer.
Industry sources had said American was looking for about 25-30 wide-body jets, making a Boeing deal potentially worth some $7-8.5 billion.
Aircraft analysts had predicted American's decision would be important for the health of the A330neo program, because a win there could spur further sales and prevent new defections.
The latest setback is expected to trigger a scramble by Airbus to prevent the A330neo's top buyer - and one of its largest corporate customers - AirAsia (KL:AIRA), changing its mind after announcing it would stick with the A330neo.
AirAsia executives visited Boeing earlier this month and have said they were examining the 787.
There are also growing doubts over the fate of an order for 28 A330neo jets by IranAir, part of a deal for 100 Airbus jets, as U.S. President Donald Trump strikes an increasingly hawkish tone over the future of an international sanctions deal.
Between them, AirAsia and IranAir make up over 40 percent of the current order book for the A330neo.
Longer-term, Airbus faces deeper unease over its wide-body position in case failure to impose the A330neo leaves it over-dependent on a single model, the newer A350-900, according to two industry sources. Airbus insists the larger A350-1000 is also ripe for an upturn in sales after a recent calm period.
Airbus officials also say other airlines are looking at the A330neo. Bloomberg News reported this week that the planemaker could introduce a freighter version.

UK-based Rolls-Royce (L:RR) meanwhile denied a Bloomberg report that its Trent 7000 engines, which power the A330neo, were affected by issues on the Trent 1000, which is available on the 787 and which has faced reliability problems.

Last year 784 funds went out of business compared with 735 that launched, data from Hedge Fund Research showed. Common reasons for funds to close are poor performance and difficulty raising funds.
This marks some good news for the $3.2 trillion industry after 1,057 funds shut down in 2016, marking the biggest number of liquidations since the financial crisis. Last year's fund liquidations were the lowest for a calendar year since 2011 when 775 funds shut down.
The industry currently counts 9,754 hedge funds in all, down from a peak of 10,142 in 2014.
Prominent funds including Neil Chriss' Hutchin Hill Capital, Hugh Hendry's Eclectica Asset Management and Erich Mindich's Eton Park Capital shut last year.
But stronger returns - the average fund gained 8.6 percent in 2017 - also translated into fresh money coming into the industry. Investors added some $9.8 billion in new money, boosting overall assets to $3.2 billion.

1481,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
1. Shots Fired: US-China Trade War Sends Dow Into Correction Territory 
The Dow Jones slumped more than 1,100 points between Thursday and Friday, ending the week in correction territory (down more than 10% from its recent high) as the trade-war fear gauge moved up a notch.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to sign an executive memorandum, imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports proved to be touch paper for a selloff in US stocks as the Dow slumped more than 700 points on Thursday.
Trump’s first salvo aimed directly China was met with a swift response from Beijing, who appeared more than ready, releasing a dossier of potential retaliation targets on 128 U.S. products. 
The potential targets include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, according to a statement on China's commerce ministry website. Those products could see 15% duty, while a 25% tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods.
Yet, it wasn’t all doom and gloom in US stock markets this week as Dropbox Inc (NASDAQ:DBX) impressed on its public-listing debut, closing 35% higher at $28.48. Dropbox’s IPO price was $21 a share.
Dropbox is a leading provider of cloud content management solutions, boasting 11 million paid users, over 300,000 paying business teams, and over 500 million registered users.
The Dow fell more than 400 points on Friday.
2. WTI Gets Surprise Boost From Falling US Crude Supplies
Crude oil prices rose more than 5.5% this week as an unexpected draw in U.S. crude supplies, rising geopolitical tensions and Saudi energy chief jawboning stoked demand.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s visit to Washington this week was long heralded as the ideal event for U.S. President Trump to toughen sanctions against Iran as both Trump and Mohammad Bin Salman do not favor the Iran nuclear deal.
“The Iran deal is coming up. It’s probably another month or so, and you’re going to see what I do,” Trump said earlier this week. “But Iran has not been treating that part of the world or the world itself appropriately. A lot of bad things are happening in Iran.”
An unexpected fall in U.S. crude supplies, meanwhile, also helped crude extend gains. The best was saved for last, however, as crude settled 2.5% higher on Friday after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC members could extend production cuts into 2019 to reduce global oil inventories.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose $1.58, or 2.46% to settle at $65.88 a barrel.
3. Dollar Slumps as Fed Fails to Add Fourth Rate Hike
Trade war fears and a somewhat disappointing Federal Reserve outcome weighed on the dollar as it struggled to hold gains.
The Federal Reserve, despite hiking rates by 0.25%, failed to add a fourth rate hike to its monetary policy projections while scaling back its labor market expectations.
Some argued that the Fed’s decision to raise its growth rate but keep its outlook on inflation relatively unchanged was dovish.
""Just 0.1% was added to core-PCE for 2019 and 2020, with both now at 2.10%. We're reading this as somewhat dovish because the Fed is anticipating benign inflation despite nearly 3% growth,"" Bank of Montreal said.
The dollar fell to five-week lows against its rivals.
4. Gold Glitters Once More
Gold prices enjoyed one of their best weeks in more than a month buoyed by a flight-to-safety as investors opted for safe-haven demand amid growing concerns about a U.S.-China trade war.
The rally in gold prices was also supported by a less hawkish than expected Federal Reserve as the US central bank kept its outlook on inflation and rate hikes for this year unchanged. The central bank did, however, signal a faster pace of monetary policy tightening, upping its outlook on rates for both 2019 and 2020.
Despite the sharp rally in gold prices this week, data showed traders continued to slash their bullsh bets on gold.
CFTC COT data showed money managers reduced their net long positions in gold futures to 148,700 lots from 167,900 lots for the week ended March 23.
5. Bitcoin's Promising Rally Fades
Bitcoin’s promising start to the week fell apart as the popular digital currency’s move above $9,000 was met with strong resistance.
Bitcoin rallied from a low of $7,240 to high of $9175.20 on Bitfinex exchange amid easing fears that the G20 meeting – which got underway Monday – would serve as the breeding ground for plans to crackdown on cryptocurrencies.
Finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s 20 largest economies called on regulators to “continue their monitoring of crypto-assets” but stopped short of any specific action to regulate cryptocurrencies.
Japanese regulators’ warning to Binance – the world’s largest exchange crypocurency exchange by traded value – for operating in the country without registration also weighed on sentiment.
Fears of disruption to Binance has since eased, however, as the Binance CEO, Chief Executive Officer Zhao Changpeng confirmed the company would open up an office in Malta.
Bitcoin and the wider cryptomarket has struggle find their footing after coming under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks amid scant demand.
The total cryptocurrency market cap at $331 billion – at the time of writing – remained close to levels last seen following the so-called “bloodbath” in Feb. 6.
Bitcoin rose 2% over the past seven days, Ripple XRP fell 8.93% over the same period on the Poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 14.20%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have long toasted the U.S. stock market boom that emerged from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, but one of the bull market's most vocal and visible cheerleaders has abruptly fallen silent: the U.S. President.
Since his inauguration in January last year, Donald Trump has regularly taken to Twitter to proclaim the gains in U.S. stocks, often appearing to take credit for their rise.
Following his surprise victory in November 2016, investors make a beeline for the market in what became known as the 'Trumpflation' trade - a bet that the former real estate mogul's administration would deliver a boost to the U.S. economy through increased fiscal spending, deregulation and tax cuts. 
As the following graphic shows, the frequency of Trump's tweets touting the stock market upswing increased towards the second half of 2017 as the S&P 500, a broad index of U.S. stock prices, hit a series of record highs. The index ended the year up nearly 20 percent, its best annual performance since 2012.
(GRAPHIC: Touting the stock market - https://reut.rs/2pEUUwa)
But after a violent selloff - prompted by fears of U.S. inflation - wiped over $4 trillion in global stock market capitalization earlier this year, the president's Twitter feed has gone quiet on the subject: the second-longest spell without a tweet about the market since his election.
Trump's last tweet on the market came shortly after the shakeout, warning investors they were making a ""big mistake"" for selling stocks despite ""good news"" about the economy. The S&P 500 and global stocks have struggled to recover since the rout in early February.
That development, investors say, is due to fears of a global trade war erupting on the back of tariffs and talk of further protectionist measures from the U.S. administration. Trump himself has tweeted, saying trade wars are ""good"", and ""easy to win.""
""For a person who's been obsessed with stock market gains since his election victory 16 months ago, Trump doesn't appear too concerned about the impact his tariffs are having at the moment,"" wrote Craig Erlam, market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.
The added factor of the successive departures of Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is causing investors to consider whether there has been a definitive turn in the U.S. administration's priorities. Cohn and Tillerson were widely viewed as moderates on issues of trade and foreign policy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Tiger Global Management is in the process of buying $50 million worth of shares of online asset management startup Wealthfront, a source familiar with deal said on Friday. 
Tiger Global is acquiring the stock on the secondary market mostly from former Wealthfront employees, the source said.
The deal comes a few months after Tiger Global led a $75 million investment into Wealthfront, one of the largest independent companies known as robo-advisers. 
Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that Wealthfront's valuation was cut to $500 million through the round announced in January. The source who spoke to Reuters disputed the valuation but could not provide the actual figure. 
It is unclear how the latest $50 million deal by Tiger Global affects Wealthfront's valuation. 
Representatives for Tiger Global did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wealthfront and other robo-advisers automatically create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost exchange-traded-funds for clients with as little as a few hundred dollars to invest. 
They are part of a wave of young companies that take advantage of new digital technologies to offer financial services for clients that were traditionally seen as too expensive to service by established financial institutions and target a new generation of investors.
Wealthfront's assets under management have nearly doubled over the past year to more than $10 billion. 
The model pioneered by Wealthfront and its competitors has prompted established financial institutions to launch similar services over the past few years, including Fidelity Investments  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Fidelity Investments. This has led some to question whether the startups can secure enough clients to succeed. 
This has prompted startups to diversify their offering with added tools and features.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 03:17PM ET</span>",Success for Uber’s direct loan despite driverless fatality,"By Andrew Berlin
NEW YORK (LPC) - Uber Technologies’ self-arranged term loan B was increased to US$1.5bn, justifying the taxi app company’s unconventional approach to raising the loan and succeeding despite news that one of the company’s self-driving cars had killed a pedestrian.
The groundbreaking seven-year new-money loan was placed with investors directly through Uber's capital markets team, rather than through a syndication process led by arranging banks, and also priced tight of guidance.
It is largely a bridge loan designed to fund Uber’s steep cash burn until its planned 2019 IPO, and also required investors to get comfortable with unusual credit metrics, including negative Ebitda.
The Uber car hit and killed Elaine Herzberg in Arizona late on March 18, in what is believed to be the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle.
News of the accident emerged the following day, and Uber pulled forward the commitment deadline on its loan to March 21 from an original deadline of March 22.
Uber was still able to capitalize on strong investor demand and the deal size was increased by US$250m from US$1.25bn at launch.
After the accident, Uber said it would halt the self-driving program in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto and continue to assist local, state and federal authorities as concern rippled through the auto industry.
Proceeds were earmarked for general corporate purposes – a generic use that includes investment in autonomous vehicle technology, investors said.
“I’m guessing the pullback [in that investment] will be temporary,” one investor said.
Another investor said: “I do not think the death changes anything. Six thousand pedestrians are killed a year. People are thinking, if everything craps out, will someone buy this money-losing operation for more than my loan balance?”
The loan ultimately cleared at 400bp with a 1% Libor floor at 99.5, versus opening guidance of a 425bp-450bp over Libor range with a 1% floor and 99 OID.
LEVERAGELESS
The direct placement strategy was intended to avoid attracting scrutiny from US banking regulators because the loan might breach leveraged lending guidelines. The rules raise concerns about transactions having a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of over six times or deals that are unable to be paid down by half with cashflow over five to seven years.
Uber reported roughly negative US$2bn of Ebitda in 2017, two sources said, leaving potential investors without the traditional debt-to-Ebitda credit ratio that they rely on to conduct analysis.
“It’s just too hard do a ‘real’ analysis on it,” said the second investor.
Unusually, the loan was marketed on a loan-to-value ratio. Uber is touting an equity value of US$75bn, which would provide ample coverage for lenders, although that valuation is only implied.
The current valuation follows the purchase of a 17.5% stake in the company in January by an investor consortium led by Japan's Softbank that included a tender offer for existing shares at a US$48bn valuation and new equity at a US$68bn valuation.
Including capital expenditure and interest expense, the company burned through roughly US$3bn of cash last year. The loan will boost balance sheet cash to nearly US$6bn.
CLO TRADE
Uber’s leveraged loan market debut in 2016 was criticized by regulators.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the US$1.15bn TLB with  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The deal priced at 400bp over Libor with a 1% floor.
Regulated banks could not play a direct role in the new deal as Uber is a ""criticized name"", and Uber was reluctant to go outside its relationship bank group to an unregulated lead arranger, which led to the unconventional structure.
Morgan Stanley was the only bank to play an active role in the new deal, but as Uber's financial advisor rather than a conventional arranger. Unlike in the 2016 transaction, the bank did not serve as administrative agent.
Macquarie is also serving as an intermediary to CLOs seeking to play the deal. As offshore vehicles, CLOs are prohibited from investing in US loans directly because doing so would be construed as origination, which could otherwise subject them to US corporate income taxes.
CLOs must wait for a seasoning period – typically around 48 hours – during which the originator closes and funds the loan, before it is moved into the CLO via assignment. The process avoids any potential tax liabilities.
Macquarie, which is nonregulated and therefore not subject to the leveraged lending guidance, is funding some of the loan that will be assigned to CLO accounts. Cortland Capital Market Services is the administrative agent.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",U.S. steel tariffs meet barrage of criticism at WTO,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs met a barrage of criticism at a World Trade Organization meeting on Friday, as the European Union, Japan, Australia and others joined a debate started by China and Russia. 
The EU representative dismissed U.S. assertions that the steps were needed to protect national security, saying Washington was just trying to support its industry, a Geneva trade official said.
WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said it was positive to see the discussion happening within the WTO's walls, since taking disputes outside greatly increased ""the risk of escalation in a confrontation that will have no winners"".
""Disrupting trade flows will jeopardize the global economy at a time when economic recovery, though fragile, has been increasingly evident around the world,"" he said in a statement.
""I again call for restraint and urgent dialogue as the best path forward to resolve these problems."" 
China and Russia have already said they are drawing up plans to retaliate to offset the impact of the tariffs.
China's representative at the WTO meeting said the tariffs were ""groundless"" and violated WTO rules in multiple ways, said the trade official, who gave an account of the closed-door talks on condition of anonymity. 
China's representative said that the experience of the 1930s showed that trade barriers did the opposite of safeguarding national security, a reference to the U.S. Great Depression and the build-up to World War Two.
Russia queried the basis for temporary exemptions to the tariffs, which Washington has granted to the EU, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Brazil, the official said.
South Korea said countries should be careful using national security as a reason for trade barriers, as it might set off a domino effect with other states piling in to justify measures to protect their own industries. Japan said the U.S. move was regrettable, and Turkey asked how it could be in line with WTO rules, the trade official added.
Others echoed the concerns about a domino effect, and said it might damage the WTO consensus, under which states have shied away from invoking security to justify barriers. 
Brazil said the issue could only be addressed multilaterally, but added that it was encouraged by U.S. efforts for bilateral talks on the issue, the official added. 
The U.S. representative at the meeting did not respond directly to the criticism but said its tariffs were ""consistent"" with the WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
China has added two items that it wants to discuss under ""any other business"" at the meeting, which was already set to hear 15 trade concerns.
China plans to raise concerns about another package of tariffs announced by Trump on Thursday, to combat what he says is Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property. 

China also plans to raise the issue of ""U.S. civil aviation security equipment measures"", diplomats said. No further detail was immediately available.

1520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Facebook Called to Meeting in Sweden Amid Privacy Concerns,"(Bloomberg) -- Sweden has invited  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). to a meeting next month to discuss blocking extremist propaganda and ensuring that personal data collected by the Internet giants isn’t misused.
The primary aim for the April 13 meeting will be to discuss laws requiring social media to remove terror and Nazi propaganda within 24 hours, according to Justice Minister Morgan Johansson.
“We’re one of the most connected countries,” Johansson said. “So there’s reason, when we meet, to also discuss how they treat personal information and data.”
The meeting comes amid growing concerns over disruptions to Sweden’s election in September. Political parties over the week have revealed that they have been contacted by Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-campaign data firm embroiled in a scandal over its misuse of Facebook accounts.
The ruling Social Democrats said they haven’t been contacted by the firm, while the Moderates said they rejected an approach.
Swedish party leaders also plan to meet later on and discuss methods in their election campaigns, Johansson said.
“One has had a feeling that these kinds of methods exist but now it really comes up to the surface,” he said. “It’s cynical, and ethically indefensible. I think it’s good that Facebook has to answer to how they view these issues, and how they’ll make sure it’ll never happen again.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) will pay a $42 million fine and admitted wrongdoing to settle claims by New York's attorney general that it fraudulently routed clients' stock trades to outside firms, including one run by swindler Bernard Madoff.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the settlement on Friday, and called the fine the largest collected by the state to resolve an electronic trading probe.
The attorney general said Bank of America Merrill Lynch had undisclosed agreements with several electronic trading firms from March 2008 to May 2013 to handle client trades.
He said the bank told clients it was processing the trades in-house, even going so far as to alter trade confirmations, as part of an effort to make its electronic trading services appear safer and more sophisticated than they were.
Schneiderman said the ""masking"" scheme affected more than 16 million trade orders and 4 billion shares, benefiting such firms as Madoff Securities, Citadel Securities, D.E. Shaw, Knight Capital and Two Sigma Securities.
The bank also admitted to having told traders in its ""dark pool,"" a private venue where they expected protection from high-speed traders, that up to 30 percent of orders came from retail traders, when the percentage was closer to 5 percent.
""Bank of America Merrill Lynch went to astonishing lengths to defraud its own institutional clients about who was seeing and filling their orders, who was trading in its dark pool, and the capabilities of its electronic trading services,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.
Bill Halldin, a bank spokesman, said in an email: ""At all times we met our obligation to deliver the best prices to clients. About five years ago, we addressed the issues concerning communicating to clients about where their trades were executed.""
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank also admitted that its masking activity violated New York's powerful securities fraud law, the Martin Act.
In 2016,  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) settled separate electronic and high-speed trading probes by Schneiderman's office for a respective $35 million, $30 million and $18.5 million. They also reached related settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term for running a huge Ponzi scheme involving his investment advisory business.

Blankfein's total compensation was about $22 million in 2017, compared with $20.2 million a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.
Top executives at big Wall Street banks have seen their compensation rise in 2017.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon was paid $29.5 million, a 5.4 percent increase; while  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) CEO James Gorman's compensation saw an increase of 20 percent to $27 million.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) CEO Michael Corbat's compensation jumped 48 percent to $23 million.
Goldman's chief operating officer, David Solomon, was paid $16.4 million in total compensation.
The bank said on March 12 Harvey Schwartz, co-chief operating officer, would retire, leaving David Solomon as sole president and chief operating officer.
Solomon is now the most obvious successor to Blankfein, who has held the top job for 12 years. (http://reut.rs/2GgKqgO)

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>","After transition deal, Bank of England to update its Brexit approach next week","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said it would update banks and insurers next week on its approach to Brexit given that Britain and the European Union have now adopted a transition deal.
""The Bank of England welcomes the EU Council's conclusion that there should be a transition period following the UK's withdrawal from the EU,"" a BoE spokesperson said on Friday.
""In light of the EU Council’s conclusions, we will provide an update on our regulatory approach to preparations for EU withdrawal next week.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority also said it welcomed the deal but made no mention of updating the firms it regulates.
Banks and insurers operating in Britain are making changes, such as opening or expanding hubs in the EU, to ensure they can still serve customers in the bloc after Brexit next March.
Financial firms from the EU operating in London are also waiting to see if they can continue as branches or have to convert into subsidiaries, an expensive undertaking.
""Firms don’t want to take unnecessary and costly actions to prepare for an outcome that might never materialize,"" said Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK lobby.
""Regulators, guided by the strong political agreement, should grant firms time to wait and see what the final deal will look like before they must take further contingency action.""
European regulators, however, have so far remained silent on whether to reassure banks it's business as usual during the transition period, meaning they don't have to rush Brexit plans.
The European Central Bank, which regulates the main lenders in the euro zone, has repeatedly urged banks in Britain to speed up license applications for EU hubs to avoid being stuck in a bottleneck before Brexit Day.
EU leaders approved on Friday a ""standstill"" transition period to end 2020, but some European regulators have noted it won't be ratified until much later in the year as part of a wider withdrawal agreement, which could be derailed by other issues such as Britain's future border relations with Ireland.
The financial sector wants regulators in Britain and the EU to say they don't have to fully implement Brexit plans by next March and that cross-border insurance and derivatives contracts remain valid.
""It will now be important to have clarity from regulators as to their expectations in light of the agreed transition period,"" Simon Lewis, chief executive of AFME, a European banking industry body.
Chris Cummings, chief executive of Britain's Investment Association which represents asset managers, wants regulators to clarify how they will interpret the political agreement on transition.
""This means holding substantial discussions on regulatory cooperation agreements so firms know they can continue to serve savers and investors across Europe through Brexit and beyond,"" Cummings said. 

AFME's Lewis said the current withdrawal agreement draft does not address continuity of cross-border contracts, access to market infrastructure like clearing houses, or ensure the flow of data between Britain and the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Friday formally asked Facebook Inc's (O:FB) Mark Zuckerberg to explain at a congressional hearing how 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. 
The world's largest social media network is under growing pressure from governments, investors and advertisers. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.
""The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,"" chairman Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the panel, and Frank Pallone, the top Democrat, and other committee leaders wrote in the letter.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee did not say when they planned the hearing but it will not happen until Congress returns from a two-week recess.
Zuckerberg said this week he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers.
A Facebook spokesman confirmed the company had received the House letter and was reviewing it, but did not say whether or not Zuckerberg would agree to testify.
Separately, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee also asked Zuckerberg to testify. Senator John Thune, the committee chairman, and Bill Nelson, the top Democrat, said the committee would work with Facebook ""to find a suitable date for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify in the coming weeks.""
Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers.
Two senators also asked the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, to investigate if other firms improperly obtained user data from Facebook users. The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters this week.
Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for the mistakes his company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.
His apology has failed to appease investors and advertisers.
Facebook shares fell on Friday, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. After opening higher, they were down 1.6 percent at $162, and have fallen around 12 percent since last Friday. The company has lost more than $50 billion in market value since the allegations surfaced.
Advertisers Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) have suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online. 
On Friday, electric carmaker Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) and its rocket company SpaceX's Facebook pages - each with more than 2.6 million followers - were deleted after Chief Executive Elon Musk promised to do so. 

""I didn't realize there was one. Will do,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, responding to a person urging him to delete the SpaceX page. The Tesla page was taken down shortly afterwards. ""Definitely. Looks lame anyway,"" Musk tweeted.

Just five months ago, Wall Street analysts warned that Nike's recovery in its home markets would be a long one as German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn) launched a raft of new shoes and marketed hard. 
The bankruptcies of sporting goods retailers and Nike customers Sports Authority and Sports Chalet also hurt the Oregon-based firm that sponsors LeBron James and a slew of other major global stars.
On Thursday, Nike's Chief Executive Mark Parker said the company was seeing ""a significant reversal of trend in North America,"" as new offerings like Air VaporMax were lapped up by customers and online sales steamed ahead. 
After its third quarter results showed a 6 percent drop in revenue in the region, Nike said it expects revenue to be flat in the current quarter and to grow in the first half of the next fiscal year. 
""Key initiatives designed to reignite Nike's growth in (North America) and around the globe are gaining traction and were evident in its (third quarter) results that beat across all lines,"" Wedbush analysts said while raising their price target for the company by $1 to $75. 
Nike now has 41 products in the Top 60 selling shoes, up from 26 in November of last year, according to brokerage Jefferies. 
In contrast, Adidas had 34 in November 2017 and was now down to 18.
""Nike U.S. is back in business,"" Jefferies analysts said. 
Channel checks by the brokerage also showed that retro styles were back in favor in the quarter, and Nike was likely to have benefited the most thanks to its iconic Jordan brand.
Nike's shares were the biggest gainers among Dow Industrial Average stocks. The stock has a median price target of $74 against just over $66 on Friday. 
Analysts from a handful of other houses were more skeptical. 
""While this sounds very positive, we (and the Street) had been expecting North America to return to growth in the fourth quarter (of low single digits) versus guidance of 0 percent which seems to deflate the excitement somewhat,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon said.

MONTREAL, OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Friday welcomed as a ""positive development"" in its long ties with Boeing (N:BA) a decision by the U.S. planemaker to end a trade dispute over sales of Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries jets in the United States.
Boeing said late on Thursday it will not appeal a U.S. trade commission ruling that allows Bombardier to sell its CSeries in the United States without hefty duties. A Boeing spokesman did not give a reason.
The decision ""represents a positive development in the longstanding relationship between Canada and Boeing,"" Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said in a statement, in a sign of warming by the country's Liberal government toward the planemaker after tensions over the Bombardier dispute.
It was not clear how Boeing's decision might affect its chances in a Canadian competition to order fighter jets worth between C$15 billion ($11.68 billion) and $C19 billion.
Representatives for Canada's Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough and Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan - who share responsibility for buying military equipment - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ottawa has said bids will be evaluated in part by whether firms have caused any past economic damage to Canada - a clear reference to the U.S. planemaker.
In its case against Bombardier, Boeing had argued the CSeries benefited from unfair subsidies and was sold below cost to American carriers, heightening trade tensions between the planemaker, the United States and its allies Canada and the United Kingdom. The wings for the 110-130 seat jet are produced in Belfast.
""Boeing should feel suitably chastened that their bullying approach was justly and robustly rejected,"" said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, in a statement on Friday. 
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenberg told Reuters earlier this month it would sue Bombardier again if provoked to do so by what it deems unfair pricing, but trade analysts have also said the planemaker seemed anxious to smooth over the dispute. 
U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the trade dispute might not generate long-term damage for Boeing.
""I think mistakes were made,"" he said. ""But there aren't a lot of alternatives. And memories aren't that long in aerospace and politics."" 
Earlier in the day, Bombardier said in a statement it was happy that Boeing's ""meritless claim"" had ""come to an end.""

Airbus SE (PA:AIR) has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>","Special Report: Private equity star's picks shine, until cash-out time","By Lawrence Delevingne and John Tilak
NEW YORK/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian financier Newton Glassman has long told his private equity firm’s clients that his big bet on casinos would yield a financial jackpot.
Others haven’t been so sure.
At the end of 2011, a year after Glassman’s Catalyst Capital Group Inc took control of Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd, Catalyst told investors in a report seen by Reuters that it already had more than doubled their money and that its majority stake was worth US$475 million — for an implied equity value of the gaming company as a whole of US$699 million.
But Catalyst was forced to abandon a planned initial public offering of Gateway in 2012 after investors balked at the firm’s valuation, according to two people familiar with the effort.
In the ensuing years, Catalyst’s implied valuation of Gateway continued to climb, to more than US$1 billion as of Sept. 30, 2017, according to investor communications, all while Glassman repeatedly told clients to expect a sale that never happened.
Now, under increasing pressure to liquidate a past-due private equity fund, Glassman is again attempting a Gateway IPO at a valuation of as high as US$1.95 billion, according to a Feb. 28 Bloomberg report.
Under Catalyst’s direction, British Columbia-based Gateway has expanded its operations and just restructured its debt. Even so, Catalyst’s assessment of the impact of those moves on the company are more optimistic than those of ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, both of which still rate Gateway debt as “junk.”
Michael Lewitt, chief investment officer at hedge fund firm Third Friday Management in Boca Raton, Florida, reviewed Catalyst’s valuation of Gateway and called it “extremely aggressive.”
High valuations and delayed sales apply to more than just Gateway, Reuters has found, with potentially worrying implications for Catalyst’s four currently active funds and their big-money investors.
Catalyst follows a “loan-to-own” strategy, acquiring the discounted debt of troubled companies, mostly in Canada and the United States, taking over the business in the case of a default or by other means, and then selling at a profit after improving operations.
Early success using that strategy with Catalyst’s first fund established Glassman’s reputation as a savvy investor. It also has helped Catalyst attract enough investors to make it Canada’s third-largest private equity firm, with about C$6 billion (US$4.6 billion) in assets under management, according to data tracker Preqin.
Since Catalyst launched its second fund in 2006, however, the firm’s record of double-digit annual returns has been based largely on its own assessments of improvements to its stable of distressed companies. When put to the test, at least four of Catalyst’s major assets have been unable to find buyers at the firm’s valuations, based on a Reuters review of Catalyst’s portfolio, multiple communications from Catalyst to its clients and regulatory filings, as well as interviews with people familiar with Catalyst’s operations, academics and financial analysts.
Those major assets, plus expected payouts from pending litigation, made up US$3.3 billion – or more than two-thirds – of the overall US$4.7 billion of unrealized value across all Catalyst funds at the end of 2016, according to an April 5, 2017, report for clients. The assets include Gateway and  Callidus Capital Corp  (TO:CBL), Catalyst’s publicly listed subsidiary that specializes in high-interest loans to distressed companies and that is itself a major holding of Catalyst funds.
Failure to cash out can put additional pressure on Catalyst as funds approach the end of their lifespan, typically eight or 10 years, by which time all money – principal and profits – is expected to be returned to investors. Catalyst Fund Limited Partnership II, for example, was supposed to mature in April 2014 after starting to invest in 2006. But Catalyst has extended the deadline at least three times.
The contrast between the picture Catalyst paints of its fund assets in communications with clients and how those assets perform when a sale is attempted shows that investors may not be able to count on the returns they expect. For now, though, any harm to Catalyst’s big investors is potential, rather than actual. Glassman could still repeat his early success with his current funds by managing to sell a handful of major assets at big gains.
Glassman did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Catalyst and Callidus did not respond directly to requests for comment. In a letter to Reuters, David Moore, a lawyer for the two companies, disputed that Catalyst overvalues assets or has had trouble selling them. Reuters’ reporting, he said, is “based upon false and unreliable allegations.”
In keeping with the industry norm, Moore said, Catalyst’s proposed valuations were reviewed by outside accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. They were then separately reviewed by KPMG LLP, Catalyst’s independent auditor, which had issued unqualified audit opinions on Catalyst every year, Moore noted.
KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment.
Moore stressed that Catalyst management’s pay is derived from proceeds from asset sales and that “valuations do not in any way affect Catalyst’s compensation.” He also pointed out that Catalyst had sold 23 assets in its history, 13 of them “in accord with applicable valuations.”
He did not provide specifics on those sales. However, of the 17 completed sales showcased on Catalyst’s website, most were “substantially realized” in 2010 or earlier, often for US$50 million or less, according to a Reuters review of information Catalyst sent to clients. Nine of the sales were for the firm’s small first fund, which was largely wound down several years ago.
Catalyst investors – generally locked in for the duration of a fund’s lifespan – include endowments for the University of Michigan, McGill University and the University of Toronto, public-employee pension funds in Montana and New Jersey, and major philanthropies such as the Rockefeller Foundation. They did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on the record, citing confidentiality agreements.
Some said on condition of anonymity that they feared getting on the wrong side of Glassman, who has launched dozens of lawsuits in his career, most with Catalyst or Callidus as plaintiff. While in college, he successfully sued his father to force child support payments, according to Ontario court records.
Gateway and some other major Catalyst fund holdings examined for this article are among the assets alleged to have been overvalued in two whistleblower complaints submitted in the past 18 months to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), according to documents seen by Reuters and people familiar with the submissions.
CARS AND PHARMACEUTICALS
Private equity holdings can be difficult to value because they often lack ready markets to test their worth. Even when reviewed by third parties, a fund manager’s valuations are nonetheless open to interpretation.
Private equity experts said that, in general, a pattern of delayed sales can indicate valuations that are too high. Lewitt, the hedge fund manager, said of Gateway and other assets examined in this article: “I wouldn’t invest a penny with any manager that employs these types of valuations.”
Advantage Rent A Car is a case in point.
Catalyst started investing in the Orlando, Florida, company with a US$22.2 million bet in 2013, and its total investment stood at US$310.5 million as of Sept. 30, 2017, according to client reports.
As Catalyst’s exposure to Advantage through Funds III and IV has risen, so has its valuation of the company – even as larger rental car businesses have come under pressure from increased competition and the rise of ride-sharing outfits like Uber.
Catalyst has long promised dramatic improvements at Advantage that would lead to a successful sale. In a 2014 letter to investors, it projected that within two or three years, earnings would top US$100 million. But for 2015, Advantage had a loss of US$31 million, according to an April 2017 presentation to Catalyst clients. A more recent investor letter put projected 2018 earnings at about US$20 million.
Advantage has less than 1 percent of the U.S. market and was expected to generate revenue of US$327.7 million in 2017, according to market research firm IBISWorld. That puts Catalyst’s valuation of US$542.9 million as of Sept. 30, contained in a recent letter to investors, at a whopping 1.7 times revenue. Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Avis Budget Group Inc, the two biggest publicly traded car-rental operators in the United States, trade at less than half their 2017 revenue of US$8.8 billion each.
Advantage did not respond to requests for comment.
Another major Catalyst asset is Therapure Biopharma Inc. Glassman’s firm started investing in the Mississauga, Ontario, biotechnology company in 2006, and the commitment totaled US$82 million by the end of 2011. That year, Catalyst valued Therapure at US$202 million.
In early 2016, it tried to take Therapure public at a valuation of C$867 million, according to a Reuters analysis of the offering documents. The same documents show that Therapure had operating losses in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The effort failed in part because Catalyst’s valuation was too high for most investors and in part because of difficult market conditions, according to two people with direct knowledge of the IPO process.
In September 2017, Catalyst announced it had agreed to sell Therapure’s contract manufacturing business for US$290 million, which would result in a proportional payout for Fund II investors.
That sale price – the deal has yet to close – is less than half the US$662 million at which Catalyst valued Therapure at year-end 2016, according to a Catalyst document provided to clients in April 2017. Therapure’s remaining business – plasma-based drug development and protein therapeutics products – probably isn’t worth more than US$100 million, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the company. The unsold business is not generating profits, one of the sources said.
Therapure did not respond to requests for comment.
Since Gateway Casinos’ IPO flopped in 2012, Catalyst has continually raised the valuation of its controlling stake — to levels that yield an imputed value for the gaming company as a whole of as much as US$1.95 billion, according to the Feb. 28 Bloomberg article. That article, attributed to anonymous sources, appeared as Reuters was seeking comment from Catalyst on the firm’s valuations of Gateway and other assets. Reuters could not independently verify that an IPO was imminent or determine the calculus underlying the US$1.95 billion valuation.
Gateway operates about two dozen casinos, concentrated in western Canada and, more recently, Ontario, the country’s most populous province. It plans to invest more than C$300 million by 2020 to improve existing properties and build new ones, according to a February 2018 Gateway investor presentation.
In mid-March, Gateway completed a sale-leaseback of some properties, yielding net proceeds to Catalyst of C$483 million. Catalyst said the transaction and a parallel debt refinancing would reduce Gateway’s debt from C$953 million to C$702 million – or 4.5 times earnings, according to a recent investor presentation. That’s in line with the typical debt-to-earnings ratio of between 4 and 5 for middle-market companies, based on Thomson Reuters LPC institutional loan data.
However, it’s more optimistic than Moody’s assessment. The ratings agency estimated in early March that under the new financial plan, Gateway’s debt-to-earnings ratio wouldn’t drop below 5 for 12 to 18 months. And Standard & Poor’s said the number would climb to as high as 7.5 through 2018. Both ratings agencies still judge Gateway bonds to be non-investment grade “junk.”
By comparison, rival Great Canadian Gaming Corp had a debt-to-earnings ratio of 2 as of Dec. 31, according to a financial filing.
Moody’s also projects lower profits than Catalyst for Gateway. It did not elaborate on the full assumptions behind its numbers. A spokeswoman said the ratings agency’s calculations “reflect our conservative view of the earnings potential of the company’s assets.”
Standard & Poor’s and Gateway did not respond to requests for comment.
Moore, the Catalyst lawyer, said in a letter to Reuters that the firm’s work to improve Gateway had been “highly successful.”
EARLY SUCCESS
Now in his mid-50s, Glassman established Catalyst in 2002, after sharpening his skills at Cerberus Capital Management LP, the New York-based distressed-investment powerhouse.
Catalyst’s first fund started investing in 2003. Within several years, it had scored big wins through private sales of its positions in companies like Cable Satisfaction International Inc; AT&T (NYSE:T) Canada Inc, later known as Allstream; and Royal Group Technologies Ltd.
The US$185 million fund, tiny by private equity standards, ended up producing an average annual return of 32 percent over its lifespan, according to client reports. That’s far better than a benchmark return of about 17 percent for funds of the same 2003 vintage tracked by investment consultants Cambridge Associates.
Catalyst’s early triumph helped drive billions of dollars to the firm over four additional funds raised between 2006 and 2015. Glassman has yet to successfully wind up any of those newer funds and return all money to investors, though the most recent one, Fund V, has returned hundreds of millions of dollars since 2015.
It is not unusual for private equity firms to hold investments until near the end of a fund’s lifespan. However, data from Cambridge and Preqin show that three of Catalyst’s four active funds lag behind similarly aged funds in paying proceeds from asset sales to investors.
With Fund II already past due, Funds III and IV are to mature in December 2019 and June 2022, respectively. Most of the value of these funds – about US$1.42 billion for Fund III and US$1.36 billion for Fund IV – is unrealized, according to an April 2017 client report. That’s more than 60 percent of the total value of each.
Some of that unrealized value would come from payouts from litigation whose outcome remains uncertain.
Catalyst filed two lawsuits against longtime rival and frequent adversary West Face Capital Inc and others after it lost a bidding process to buy Canadian wireless carrier Wind Mobile from VimpelCom (NASDAQ:VEON) Ltd in 2014. Catalyst claimed that it had an exclusive agreement with VimpelCom to buy Wind Mobile and that West Face and others engaged in improper conduct to win the deal and ultimately sell at a big profit.
Judge Frank Newbould, originally hearing both cases in Ontario Superior Court, dismissed one of them, concluding that West Face and others, contrary to Catalyst’s allegations, had not used confidential information from a former Catalyst employee to make its winning bid. In his August 2016 ruling, Newbould wrote that he had “difficulty accepting as reliable much of the evidence” submitted by Glassman. He described the financier as “aggressive,” “argumentative” and more of a “salesman than an objective witness.”
Catalyst appealed Newbould’s dismissal. That appeal was dismissed Feb. 21.
The second Wind-related lawsuit, seeking C$1.3 billion in damages, was on hold, pending the outcome of Catalyst’s appeal of Newbould’s dismissal of the other case. In a report to clients, Catalyst told investors that its remaining Wind-related claim was worth US$446.9 million at the end of 2016 and that the firm has “a reasonable likelihood of success at trial.”
Newbould, who has retired from the bench and now works as an arbitrator, was targeted by an undercover agent last autumn in a sting orchestrated by Israeli investigative firm Black Cube on behalf of Catalyst, according to West Face court submissions in separate litigation. The sting, West Face alleges, was designed to discredit Newbould and his dismissal of one of the Wind-related lawsuits.
Newbould declined to comment.
Black Cube gained attention last year for its work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein to undermine women and journalists in their efforts to go public with allegations of sexual harassment and assault against the Hollywood mogul.
A spokesman for Black Cube declined to comment on questions related to Catalyst and Callidus. He said Black Cube always operates ethically and legally.
In an April 2017 presentation to investors, Catalyst told clients of Fund III that without the expected litigation payouts, net annual returns as of end-2016 would fall to 8.9 percent from 11.7 percent.
Ludovic Phalippou, a private equity expert at the University of Oxford in England, said Catalyst’s expected return on the Wind litigation was “extraordinarily” high, given that one of the cases was dismissed and that money that would have been used to buy the Wind assets were presumably deployed elsewhere.
RELATED PARTIES
One company Catalyst succeeded in selling on the stock market is Callidus, a distressed-lending business Glassman invested in, took over, and made a core holding.
Glassman’s team took Callidus public in April 2014, raising C$252 million while still keeping big positions in the company for its four current funds.
Catalyst funds provide guarantees for some of Callidus’s risky loans to distressed businesses. But those guarantees mean that investors in Catalyst funds can end up saddled with Callidus investments gone bad, such as Xchange Technology Group, an information-technology company that went bankrupt.
The relationship between Catalyst and Callidus doesn’t end there.
In May 2017, Callidus said in its first-quarter earnings report that a recent acquisition, struggling Canadian slot-machine maker Bluberi Gaming Technologies Inc, was worth about C$110 million. In footnotes, it said that figure was based largely on an agreement for Bluberi to supply 7,000 slot machines to a “commonly controlled enterprise.”
Callidus did not identify that enterprise. But it appears to be Gateway Casinos, which fits the description in a recent Callidus earnings report of a “large diversified gaming company in Canada that is controlled in common with ... Catalyst.” Catalyst did not respond to requests for comment.
Such an order is large for Bluberi, a small company that recently emerged from bankruptcy. Bluberi has about 1,000 machines in use today, according to a third-quarter 2017 ranking by industry consultants Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC. The top three companies have nearly 40,000 each. Gateway operates 9,500 slot machines, according to its website.
Stephen Casey, a lawyer and accountant in New York with private equity experience, reviewed Callidus’s Bluberi holding for Reuters and called it “a very aggressive valuation based on a related-party order and some pretty speculative assumptions.”
The risks, Casey said, include whether Bluberi’s casino clients can get the required regulatory approvals for expansion, and whether Bluberi is able to produce all the machines required.
Callidus acknowledged both of those risks in earnings reports last year.
Bluberi did not respond to requests for comment.
Callidus’s Bluberi valuation, now at C$113 million, is based on a potential sale using an accounting method the company calls “yield enhancement,” which is not recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
In a May shareholder report, Callidus said it would give greater prominence to calculations based on IFRS in its public disclosures in response to an Ontario Securities Commission review of its financial reporting. The OSC declined to comment.
Catalyst has said it would like to find a buyer to take Callidus private again, suggesting in a press release last year a price of C$18 to C$22 a share. The stock now trades around C$7, down more than 60 percent over the past 12 months.
Callidus said in October 2016 that it had hired Goldman, Sachs & Co to handle a sale process that would be completed by June 2017.
Goldman declined to comment.
No buyer has yet emerged.

In an amended version of the share prospectus filed last month, the Swedish company said it continues to be impacted by third-party attempts to gain unauthorized access to its premium service.
The music-streaming company previously included the 2 million users in calculations for some of its key performance indicators, including MAUs, ad-supported users, content hours, and content hours per MAU. More https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639920/000119312518092759/d494294df1a.htm
Spotify said it currently does not have the data to adjust previously provided key performance indicators, and as a result certain metrics may be 'overstated' in its prospectus.
The company had 157 million active users as of Dec. 31, of which about 71 million were paid subscribers who access ad-free versions of the service, according to its website.
Spotify had filed this week for a direct listing of its shares, instead of a traditional IPO.

The direct listing will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled on Friday with more than 1,000 points knocked off the Dow in two days as investors, increasingly nervous about a potential U.S. trade war with China, shied away from risk ahead of the weekend and sought shelter from further losses.
In a volatile session, the S&P 500 came within a hair of its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. The benchmark index also nudged closer to its February low, which marked a correction, ending 9.9 percent lower than its Jan. 26 record.
""There is concern what the trade war could look like. Investors want to manage their risk. If it escalates rapidly, it could be a major headwind for the market,"" said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. 
President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods moved the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war as China declared plans to levy duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fruit and wine even as it urged the United States to ""pull back from the brink.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 424.69 points, or 1.77 percent, to 23,533.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 55.43 points, or 2.10 percent, to 2,588.26 after hitting an intraday low that was barely above its 200-day moving average of 2585.22.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 174.01 points, or 2.43 percent, to 6,992.67.
For the week, the Dow was down 5.67 percent, the S&P 500 was down 5.95 percent and the Nasdaq was down 6.54 percent, marking their biggest weekly percentage falls since January 2016.
The Dow was down 11.6 percent since its Jan. 26 high, and hit its lowest close since confirming a correction in February.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&P 500, finished up 1.53 points at 24.87, its highest close since Feb. 13.
The S&P's financial sector (SPSY) was the S&P's biggest percentage loser, at 3 percent, after a volatile session in which it was whip-sawed by volatile Treasury yields. 
Bloomberg News cited China’s ambassador to the United States saying that the country is “looking at all options” in response to tariffs, which could include scaling back purchases of U.S. Treasuries.
Nasdaq was weighed down by declines in momentum stocks such as Facebook (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL).
The semiconductor sector took a fall after Micron Technology's (O:MU) quarterly report stoked fears about falling NAND prices. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) slumped 3.3 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.72-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 42 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 93 new lows.

1549,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",China Hits Back on Trump Tariffs as Europe Off Hook for Now,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade conflict between China and the U.S. escalated, with Beijing announcing its first retaliation against metals levies hours after President Donald Trump outlined fresh tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports and pledged there’s more on the way.
On Friday, China unveiled tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. imports in response to steel and aluminum duties ordered by Trump earlier this month. The White House then declared a temporary exemption for the European Union and other nations on those levies, making the focus on China clear. Though Beijing’s actions so far are seen by analysts as measured, there may be more to come.
Equity indexes from Tokyo to Frankfurt tumbled with European equities falling to the lowest in more than a year. U.S. stock futures dropped, signaling a further retreat for the S&P 500 Index after it fell 2.5 percent, on risks a further escalation in trade tensions will undermine an unusual phase of synchronized global economic growth.
Suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). were among the hardest hit in Hong Kong and mainland markets on Friday, as investors focused on potential losers from the trade spat.
“China’s response is surprisingly modest in light of the U.S. actions, suggesting there could be a good deal more to come,” said Stephen Roach, a former non-executive chairman for Morgan Stanley in Asia and now a senior fellow at Yale University. “As America’s third largest and most rapidly growing export market and as the largest foreign owner of Treasuries, China has considerably more leverage over the U.S. than Washington politicians care to admit.”
IP Abuses
In a ramping up of his America First ethos, Trump Thursday said he had ordered tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports as recompense for alleged intellectual property abuses. Hours later, China announced planned tariffs on imports of U.S. pork, recycled aluminum, steel pipes, fruit and wine, according to a Commerce Ministry statement on Friday.
China will also pursue legal action against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization in response to the U.S.’s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the statement said, and called for dialog to resolve the dispute. With Beijing’s response to the tariffs aimed at intellectual-property abuses -- enacted under Section 301 of the U.S. trade law -- as yet unannounced, the relatively limited value of trade curbs may be just the first stage of its response.
Later on Friday, Chen Fuli, head of the treaty and law department at China’s Commerce Ministry, said that a comprehensive plan to counter the 301 action has been prepared. He added that that the government has had no communication with the U.S. on the issue as it is a unilateral action not covered under WTO rules.
“This has been long in the making,” Trump said signing the intellectual-property order, adding that the tariffs could affect as much as $60 billion in goods. He told reporters, “This is the first of many.”The White House gave the European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, until May 1 to negotiate levies on steel and aluminum. The administration said the suspensions can be renewed or revoked then, “pending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to U.S. national security.”
Despite securing an exemption for now, EU officials meeting in Brussels complained about the U.S. approach. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called the move on metal ”highly unfortunate unilateral action, which goes against agreed international rules.”
The U.S. will impose 25 percent duties on targeted Chinese products to compensate for the harm caused to the American economy from China’s policies, according to a fact sheet released by USTR. The proposed product list will include items in aerospace, information and communication technology and machinery. The USTR will announce the proposed list in the next “several days,” according to the fact sheet.
Long in Making
No tariffs have been collected yet, as measures in both China and the U.S. are subject to further negotiation and public consultation.
If China and the U.S. can’t reach an agreement on steel and aluminum trade, after a public consultation period which ends March 31, Beijing could begin collecting tariffs of 15 percent on imports worth $977 million, including fresh fruit, nuts, wines, denatured alcohol, ginseng, and seamless steel tubes. After evaluation, China could then implement tariffs of 25 percent on around $2 billion worth of product imports, including pork and aluminum.
Economists said the impact of the tariffs announced until now may be limited. If the U.S. imposes a 25 percent duty on $50 billion of imported goods, the additional $12.5 billion tariff is equivalent to an additional 2.9 percent charge on all of China’s exports, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists led by Haibin Zhu in Hong Kong.
“From a macro perspective the additional tariff is only equivalent to 0.1 percent of China’s GDP and affected exports only account for 2.2 percent of China’s total exports,” they wrote in a note. “The direct macro impact tends to be limited.”
Policy makers across the world are warning of a brewing trade war that could undermine the broadest global recovery in years. Meanwhile, business groups representing companies ranging from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are warning U.S. tariffs could raise prices for consumers and sideswipe stock prices. Central bankers have also sounded warnings.
Trump also directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to propose new investment restrictions on Chinese companies within 60 days to safeguard technologies the U.S. views as strategic, said senior White House economic adviser Everett Eissenstat.
The Trump administration is framing the move as a major turning point in U.S.-China relations. It followed a seven-month investigation by USTR into allegations China violates U.S. intellectual property, under the seldom-used section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The U.S. concluded China engages in a range of violations, including policies that force American companies to transfer technology and the accessing of trade secrets through hacking, said Eissenstat.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 11:03PM ET</span>",Globalists buck U.S. index fund trend,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volatility in U.S. equity markets this year is pushing investors not only to invest in stocks abroad, but also to commit their money to an even more foreign place: the hands of stockpickers rather than index funds.
A near decade of gains in U.S. stock prices has left investors on edge about the prospect that anything could end the party, including the prospect of interest rate rises under new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or a misstep by one of the market's darlings. 
For instance, the 9.2 percent two-day slide of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) earlier this week, which wiped out $50 billion in its market capitalization, underscored the risks to market leaders in the technology sector after the social media company faced questions from regulators and politicians about how its users' personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
Josh Shores, principal at Southeastern Asset Management Inc, said the time is ripe to look outside the United States as valuations are more attractive overseas relative to their risks.
""At the end of an almost 10-year bull up-cycle where the U.S, and growth and passive have really dominated,"" he said, ""we feel good about being positioned the other way from here.""
Small wonder. 
Stockpickers focused on investment abroad have been huge beneficiaries of new investor cash as many have beaten their benchmarks. Those funds are on course to post their second straight year of inflows even as their U.S. counterparts face the sting of investor flight to lower-cost index funds. 
Actively managed non-U.S. stock funds have already attracted $19.4 billion in 2018, far surpassing outflows at the same time last year, and nearing the $23.5 billion total for all of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. 
Their passively managed rivals have taken in $45.6 billion so far this year, through February.
In 2017, 50.8 percent of ""foreign large blend"" funds tracked by Morningstar Inc beat their index-tracking rivals, while 59.1 percent of diversified emerging market funds succeeded, in both cases improving their less impressive long-term track record.
The volatile start to 2018 for U.S. stock prices is giving investors all the more reason to defang portfolios heavily weighted toward technology giants. Facebook accounts for about 2.0 percent of an S&P 500 index (SPX) fund's return. ""Tech is not a heavy benchmark constituent in our part of the world,"" said Thomas Melendez, manager of the $11 billion MFS International Diversification Fund (O:MDIDX), whose performance has bested most rivals over the last decade, according to Lipper.
'IT'S MORE THAN FACEBOOK'
More cash to manage would be a boon to investors including Fabio Paolini, a portfolio manager on the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund (O:APCTX), which has turned in stronger performance than its peers and index over the past three years. Pictet Asset Management SA manages $197 billion.
Paolini and other investors focused outside the United States see places where they can put the cash to work with bargain-priced, all-weather companies that will grow even if the economy stalls.
""We see opportunities - a little bit everywhere,"" said Paolini. The company took a stake, for instance, in  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), the Parisian aircraft engine company that he said enjoys a near-monopoly position in its market.
Southeastern, with $18 billion under management, has built up a stake in London-based  Hikma Pharmaceuticals  PLC (L:HIK) in recent months, as other asset managers have ditched stocks in the region.
That stock's true value has been clouded by investors' pessimistic view on both generic drugs and the United Kingdom's negotiations to exit the European Union, but the drug company has valuable business units including injectable drugs, said Shores. 
More than four in ten fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are holding less stock in Britain than their benchmark, an all-time high.
Many of the active international funds are taking big bets on small groups of stocks, hoping that they will end up with far better gains than index funds whose performance is diluted by hundreds of holdings.
The  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Jennison Global Opportunities Fund (O:PRJAX) has fewer than 40 holdings, with top positions like Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) taking up nearly 6.0 percent of the portfolio.

The S&P 500 futures was down seven and a half points or 0.28% to 2,635.75 as of 6:43 AM ET (10:43 GMT) while Dow futures decreased 103 points or 0.43% to 23,860.0. Meanwhile tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures fell 53 points or 0.79% to 6,639.0.
Stocks tumbled on Thursday as Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports in retaliation for China’s unfair seizure of U.S. intellectual property.
China promptly retaliated with plans to announce tariffs of its own against the U.S., rising concern among investors of a global trade war.
The announcements came as markets were already throttled from a rout in February and as investors prepare for increased interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday and  increase the pace of tightening has also left markets on edge.

1554,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 06:32AM ET</span>",Japan Bulls Can't Evade Tariffs Nor a $200 Billion Stock Wipeout," (Bloomberg) -- Spare a thought for Tokyo’s bulls. Abandoned, distracted by scandal, and now they’re watching $200 billion wiped from stock values by American trade measures they thought they could avoid.
They were nursing the biggest losses in global markets Friday, down 4.5 percent on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average and 3.6 percent on the Topix Index. Unlike stocks in Hong Kong or the U.S., theirs are now squarely below their worst level of February, down more than 8 percent for the year and in the grip of a strengthening currency.
Nothing new, for anyone who’s traded here.
“Japan is a cyclical equity market,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management Japan Ltd. “When risk is off, Japan gets offloaded first.""
While Trump’s latest and loudest protectionist blow fell on China, hopes that Japan will be spared from steel and aluminum levies also took a hit Thursday as the country wasn’t on a list of exempted countries given by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Senate testimony.
Dashing Hopes
The selloff is dashing hopes of those who thought signs of an improving economy would stem losses that have now swelled to almost 15 percent since Jan. 23. Friday’s plunge came the same day a key inflation gauge ticked up, putting the Bank of Japan halfway to its goal of 2 percent.
As is often the case, part of the problem is foreign investors. They’ve yanked nearly $50 billion from futures on the Topix and Nikkei 225 this year. Another 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) has fled cash equities this year through to March 9, according to data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
As if that wasn’t enough. The yen has spiraled to a 16-month high against the dollar, always a factor in chasing foreigners out. Apart from being a barometer of risk, strength in the currency erodes corporate profits at export-driven Japan.
Something Wrong
Right now, the broader Topix, whose direction is often dictated by foreign investors who account for roughly a third of the market, is on track for its worst performance since 2011. It’s fallen below its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year, a sign that ""something wrong"" is going on, Hiroshi Matsumoto, head of Japan investment at Pictet Asset Management Ltd., said.
Pictet earlier this year downgraded its global equity outlook to neutral, citing a bearish view for U.S. equities. But it stayed positive on Japan, betting the economy, earnings and low valuations would cushion global influences.
Matsumoto is one of many bulls in the Japanese market who have put their faith in economic fundamentals. He’s been perplexed by everything from Trump’s protectionist rhetoric to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s alleged link to a controversial government land sale to a school.

""I don’t want to overreact. But, I don’t want to underestimate the impact,"" either, Matsumoto said, referring to the latest development on Trump’s vow to slap China with a $50 billion tariff. ""It’s difficult.""
Bears Awaken
It’s all starting to dent sentiment for Japan, where bears had previously been hard to find. While overweight the country on average, that will change if political risk rises, a fund manager survey published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed. Credit Suisse earlier this month downgraded its outlook on Japanese equities to benchmark, calling the market ""most cyclical of the global market.""
Matsumoto isn’t giving up.
""Key is in how strong or weak earnings guidances are from companies,"" he said. ""If the management says there’s no need to worry, even if the currency rises to 100 yen per-dollar levels, that they can make profits next year; if we hear such an optimistic outlook, the market can have more confidence.""

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Australia's big banks broke laws and failed public, inquiry reveals","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top banks routinely and repeatedly breached laws when issuing home loans, credit cards and other consumer loans, according to a scathing summary of the first round of hearings at the country's inquiry into financial misconduct.
Rowena Orr, barrister assisting the judicial inquiry, said on Friday the misconduct found in subpoenaed confidential records and through public examination of bank executives included several instances of breaches of the Corporations Act and the National Credit Act.
""Over the last two weeks the commission has received evidence of misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations by a number of financial services entities,"" Orr told the inquiry.
Some of the examples included: selling insurance to thousands of people who could not claim it; offering bonuses and incentives that encouraged bankers to engage in fraudulent lending practices; and giving car yards higher commissions for selling higher-rate auto loans.
In summary, the inquiry found that the banks failed to act honestly and fairly, as required by law and breached their obligations to lend responsibly.
The banks have the opportunity to respond to the Royal Commission, as the year-long inquiry is called, which is due to publish an interim report by September. 
Its final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation on the financial sector, which includes the 'Big Four' lenders - National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac Banking Corp.
The interim summary was focused on instances of misconduct by the consumer credit units of several major financial institutions including ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac. 
The center-right government reluctantly agreed to order the inquiry last year in response to a series of banking scandals, including interest-rate rigging and breaches of anti-money laundering laws by CBA. 
FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS 
Earlier in the day, Westpac disclosed to the inquiry 55 new instances where staff falsified or accepted falsified documentation linked to home loan applications over the past few years. 
The inquiry also heard on Friday that Westpac offered credit card limit increases to more than two million potentially vulnerable people without making minimum checks about whether they had a job and could afford to repay the debt.
As a result, the bank derived A$23 million ($17.74 million) in profits but thousands of people were left in financial difficulty, the inquiry revealed. 
The Australian Securities and Investments Commision (ASIC) raised Westpac's lending practices with the banking industry lobby group as early as 2012, but the bank ignored the regulator's concerns and its threats of legal action. 
""Of the big four banks, Westpac appears most resistant to ASIC and the laws we administer,"" according to a 2015 ASIC memo about a meeting it held with Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted, which was disclosed in the inquiry.
The inquiry will reconvene in April to assess the scandal-hit financial advice and wealth management sectors.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday with autos and basic resources stocks bearing the brunt of a wide sell-off triggered by mounting worries that U.S. tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China could escalate.
All sectors were trading in negative territory, sending pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index falling for a second day, down 1.4 percent to its lowest level since February 2017. 
All eyes were on the response from China, which urged the United States on Friday to ""pull back from the brink"", and unveiled its own plans to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports.
Although risks that the tariffs could trigger a full-blown trade war, some investors said they still did not expect that to happen, highlighting that the retaliation measures announced by China remained relatively mild.
Caution, however, pushed investors into defensive stocks like utilities (SX8P) and telecoms (SXKP), which declined by less than 1 percent but outperformed the broader market, as they are seen as less exposed to a deterioration in global trade. 
Euro zone indexes including the export-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) also fell more 1.8 percent but remained above early March lows, while the FTSE (FTSE) dropped 1.1 percent to fresh 15-month lows reached on the back of a strengthening pound. 
""Our central scenario remains one in which retaliation will be contained and will leave little impact on growth, but the risk of it happening alone is enough for us to maintain a preference for defensive assets,"" said UniCredit economists led by Chiara Silvestre in a note.
 Enel  (MI:ENEI) fell 0.2 percent after Italy's biggest utility reported growth a 14.4 percent growth in its 2017 ordinary net profit last year that to beat its own guidance.
Among the few gainers on Friday were shares in metal miners  Fresnillo  (L:FRES), Randgold (L:RRS) and  Polymetal  (L:POLYP) , all up between 0.5 and 1.5 percent, as the gold price rose on the back of growing demand for safe haven assets.
Still on the tariff front, the previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect on Friday but more countries, including the European Union, have obtained a temporary exemption.
""In theory it would be a soothing news but in reality it risks making the confrontation between the U.S and China harsher,"" said JCI Capital fund manager Alessandro Balsotti. 
Among the companies, exposed to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, shares in carmakers  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 2.5 and 2.1 percent respectively, while steel tube maker  Tenaris  (MI:TENR) dropped 4.1 percent and ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG) declined 2.7 percent. 
Elsewhere in corporate arena, Indivior (L:INDV) plunged 4.4 percent following an U.S. court ruling against the maker of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone. Indivior said it intended to appeal against the ruling in favor of generic competitor Alvogen.

Among the few gainers, GSK (L:GSK) rose 2.9 percent after it pulled out of the bidding war for Pfizer's consumer health business  following in the footsteps of Reckitt Benckiser earlier this week.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 05:02AM ET</span>",Shares of Deutsche Bank's DWS unit edge higher in market debut,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shares in Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS made small gains on Friday in their debut on the Frankfurt stock exchange, a milestone in the German lender's turnaround plan.
The shares changed hands at 32.60 euros at 0845 GMT, just above the issue price of 32.50 euros set by the bank on Thursday, a level expected to generate proceeds of about 1.4 billion euros for Deutsche.
That was less than the bank originally hoped for, but the listing of DWS, more than a year in the making, is expected to be one of Germany's biggest this year and is part of a broader overhaul which  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) hopes will move it on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals.
""We're happy - in the last few days we never thought of postponing or cancelling the stock market listing,"" said DWS Chief Executive Nicolas Moreau, referring to recent falls on international stock markets.
A company spokesman said the order book for the share offering had been subscribed multiple times over.
The IPO was brought forward to lock in the valuation ahead of any further stock market falls.
DWS said on Thursday that 44.5 million shares had been placed with investors, a smaller than expected 22.25 percent of its shares. The placement price gives the asset management business a market value of 6.5 billion euros.
Originally, Deutsche Bank had hoped to generate proceeds of up to 2 billion euros by selling 25 percent of DWS, giving the unit a value of 8 billion euros.
During the listing process, the bank scaled back its expectations but did find big investors, including insurer Nippon Life of Japan and investment company Tikehau Capital.. Nippon agreed to acquire a 5 percent stake.
A successful IPO will be a relief for Deutsche, which has been dogged by three successive years of losses.
The bank's shares fell sharply on Wednesday when its finance chief warned of headwinds for its investment bank in the first quarter.
But Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke was optimistic about DWS.

""It's a revenue stream, it's capital-light, it's higher margin and it's higher growth we think than many of our businesses,"" von Moltke told an investor conference in London.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 07:47AM ET</span>",GSK pulls out of $20 billion race for Pfizer consumer assets,"By Martinne Geller and Ludwig Burger
LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) has quit the race to buy Pfizer's (N:PFE) consumer healthcare business, endangering an auction the U.S. drugmaker hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion.
It was not immediately clear whether there were other offers for the business, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, following this week's deadline for binding bids.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which announced its withdrawal on Friday, was seen as the frontrunner to buy the assets after  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) left the race late on Wednesday. Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) stepped away from the auction in January.
A source familiar with the matter said GSK declined to make a final bid for the assets in the end. 
""While we will continue to review opportunities that may accelerate our strategy, they must meet our criteria for returns and not compromise our priorities for capital allocation,"" GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in a statement.
GSK shares rose nearly 4 percent, as investors' concerns about a potential dividend cut eased. 
 Pfizer  said on Friday it continued to evaluate potential alternatives for the business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, as well as retaining it.
""We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,"" a spokesman said. 
Sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday it was possible there were other bids. On Friday, a source said that if not, Pfizer could try to tap private equity funds. 
Pfizer is the world's fifth-largest player in consumer health with 2.5 percent of a market bolstered by aging populations and growing interest in health and wellness. 
The business, which also includes Chapstick lip balm and Caltrate supplements, is seen as attractive but has come to market at a bad time. GSK and Reckitt are under shareholder pressure to exercise financial discipline, while other potential suitors, such as Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) are busy with other projects.
What is more, the global consumer health market has slowed, from 4-6 percent like-for-like sales growth to 0-3 percent growth,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in December. Major players in the over-the-counter market have been grappling with pricing pressure stoked by online players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and private label competitors. 
Pfizer's hope of fetching around $20 billion translated to a multiple of about 20 times the unit's core earnings, according to Bernstein analysts, in line with past deals in the sector during faster growing times. 
Differences in price expectations also hobbled German drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) attempts to sell its consumer products unit, where a price tag of up to 4 billion euros ($5 billion) deterred initial suitors such as Nestle (S:NESN), Perrigo (N:PRGO) and a private-equity consortium. 
Reckitt's early interest in the Merck assets also waned as the Pfizer auction gained momentum.
SPLIT OPINION 
Buying the Pfizer business would have been the boldest move to date for Walmsley, who took over at GSK last April. But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.
Acquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.
That is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal (PA:OREP) - since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.
Last month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelt out that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.
The overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields. 

GSK runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with  Novartis  (S:NOVN), which complicates any acquisitions. Novartis has the right to sell down its 36.5 percent stake, valued at around $10 billion, from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered the case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure and directors after a complaint from Union Bank, which the CBI said had been cheated out of about 3.14 billion rupees.
Reuters could not reach Totem or its directors for comment.
The case comes after a more-than $2 billion fraud in state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), dubbed the biggest bank fraud in India's history, triggered scrutiny of all soured bank loans for any sign of wrongdoing.
Totem Infrastructure, loans to which became non-performing in June 2012, ""allegedly diverted the funds by opening accounts outside the consortium (of eight banks) and through payments of wages by showing excess expenditure and huge stocks"", the CBI said in a statement late on Thursday.
The CBI said in a separate statement that the company concerned was Totem Infrastructure.
Union Bank did not respond to requests for comment from either the stock exchange or Reuters.
By 0719 GMT, Union Bank shares were trading 8.3 percent down at 86.85 rupees. The stock fell as much as 9.13 percent to touch its lowest price since March 2007.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 03:52AM ET</span>",AirAsia switches to digital mode as it lightens load with leasing sale,"By Anshuman Daga and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tony Fernandes, the co-founder of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), is seeking to transform Asia's biggest budget airline into an asset-light, digitally focused firm after the $1 billion sale of its leasing business, in an effort to foster sustainable growth. 
AirAsia, which pioneered budget air travel in Asia along the lines of Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) in Europe, is now building a sprawling empire that includes a payments company, logistics firm, food and beverages brands and a loyalty program.
Leveraging the profusion of customer data from its 65 million-plus passengers, the focal point of the strategy is a digital push that exceeds in scale that of regional budget airlines like Indonesia's Lion Group and Cebu Pacific of the Philippines.
AirAsia will also be going head-to-head against flag carriers such as Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) which is ramping up investments in digital technology.
The goal is to offset the volatile earnings from the cyclical airline business. 
""The biggest asset is our data,"" Fernandes told Reuters in an interview. ""And we're going to monetize that data over a series of joint ventures in three kinds of pools.""
That includes turning its loyalty program points into a more formal currency through an initial coin offering, building a bigger logistics business and growing its content offering.
LOSS OF LEASING 
In the near term however, analysts say the move by one of Airbus's (PA:AIR) biggest global customers to part-lease its current and ordered fleet of 500-plus planes could hurt its profits and leave it exposed to the risk of higher lease rates.
""The leasing arm was a stable low risk business,"" said Ngoi Se Chai, a partner at Hong Kong-based Oaklands Path Capital Management. ""Now that that's sold, earnings will come down and become more volatile. I think they sold something they shouldn't have sold."" 
While the sale proceeds from the leasing business will be used to reduce debt, the bulk will be paid out as special dividends, potentially limiting the upside in a stock that has more than quadrupled since hitting a seven-year low in late 2015.
""The amount of money generated from this exercise could almost wipe out AirAsia's entire debts, so it would appear a positive move,"" said Shukor Yusof, founder of consultancy Endau Analytics, but he noted it faces risks associated with higher leasing rates.
Leasing had accounted for around 20 percent of AirAsia's revenue, with a similar share earned from non-ticket items like baggage fees and food sales.
The aim is to lift revenue from so-called ancillaries by 12 percent this year.
AirAsia plans to launch remittance and lending products in Southeast Asia, through its BigPay debit card and mobile app in Singapore after the recent launch in Malaysia, BigPay's group CEO Chris Davison said.
But for now, the company's non-flying revenue lags global low-cost leaders like  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) in the United States and Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings (L:WIZZ) in Europe that receive 40 percent of revenue from ancillaries, said Jay Sorensen, president of U.S.-based consultancy IdeaWorksCompany.
He said AirAsia's food, in-flight Wi-Fi and loyalty programs were good offerings but its approach in pricing add-ons was not maximizing revenue because it only offered two bundled choices rather than three.
""The best practice today is to present three choices at the same time, based upon a good, better and best model."" 
GOING DIGITAL
The digital push is front and center as Fernandes restructures AirAsia into a listed group that oversees stakes in multiple airlines in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, India, Japan and soon Vietnam and China and digital ventures rather than having the listing based on its Malaysian airline.
Combined, AirAsia forecasts the digital businesses will account for 7.6 percent of revenue this year, nearly half of its ancillary sales.
Former CEO Aireen Omar, who became deputy group CEO in January, is overseeing the non-airline businesses in a single entity that will ultimately seek a U.S. listing.
Corrine Png, CEO of research firm Crucial Perspective said AirAsia could triple its share price if it can successfully collect and monetize its Big Data.

""AirAsia's current valuations are low as investors see it as a cyclical airline,"" she said. ""However, as its long-term revenue and earnings growth prospects improve, equity investors will start to value AirAsia like a growth stock.""

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",Thiam's earnings dip as Credit Suisse overhauls executive pay,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is revising pay for top management as it completes a major overhaul, hoping to ease shareholder concerns with a returns-focused policy and lower 2017 rewards.
Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam earned slightly less during his third year in the role, the bank's annual report showed on Friday, after cuts to his long-term share bonuses brought his pay under 10 million Swiss francs ($10.6 million).
""The compensation committee considers that Mr. Thiam's proposed total compensation for 2017 of 9.7 million francs reflects his strong performance against the suite of measures, while also recognizing that the group is still in a transition phase,"" compensation committee chair Kai Nargolwala said.
Changes to the bonus scheme for the current year's pay come amid increasing scrutiny of executive pay, including a ""Fat Cat"" referendum in 2013 giving shareholders a veto power over management and board pay in Switzerland.
On the other hand, the proposal could also mean a significant pay rise for several executives if the bank beats its targets and delivers rising rewards to its shareholders.
The bank last year agreed to cut executive bonuses by 40 percent, including 2016 cash bonuses and 2017 share incentives, after coming under fire for proposing stepped up payouts despite a second consecutive multi-billion-franc loss.
Nargolwala, who became chairman of the compensation committee in April, said the bank decided to simplify its compensation policy for 2018 to reflect investor feedback.
The new bonus system should provide greater transparency, Nargolwala said, while focusing more on profitability and shareholder returns.
These changes were not reflected in the 2017 pay scheme, which saw overall executive earnings drop 4.3 percent and bank-wide bonuses drop 3.4 percent to 3.2 billion francs.
SWISS PAY
Credit Suisse posted a 983 million franc loss for 2017 following a U.S. tax asset writedown. On a pre-tax basis, it was the bank's first year in profit since Thiam launched the turnaround plan in 2015.
Thiam earned 4.5 million francs less in 2017 than the head of crosstown rival UBS (S:UBSG), which years ago underwent a similar restructuring to scale back its investment bank and emphasize wealth management. 
Thiam's pay still places him among the top earners amongst Swiss company bosses.
At  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), top managers did not take bonuses as Germany's flagship lender posted its third annual loss in a row. CEO John Cryan earned 3.4 million euros ($4.2 million) in 2017.
Credit Suisse will propose an overall 5.5 percent increase in the maximum payout available to top management and board members for 2018 compared to what the bank had originally envisioned for 2017.
The rise is mainly due to higher maximum share rewards for three unnamed executives, who do not include the CEO.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>",Nissan says aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2022,"By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) announced plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles (EVs) annually by 2022 and said it would focus its lower-emissions lineup on all-battery and gasoline-hybrid EVs rather than costlier technologies including plug-in hybrids.
Nissan and its rivals are planning to crank up development and production of electric cars in response to tightening emissions regulations around the world, even as demand for such vehicles remains limited due to their high cost and limited charging infrastructure.
The Japanese automaker said on Friday it would develop eight new all-battery EVs over the next four years, including four models for China, where it is planning to expand. Its luxury Infiniti brand would begin carrying new electric models from 2021, it added.
Through 2022, vehicles powered by its ""e-power"" gasoline-hybrid technology would likely comprise the majority of Nissan's electric line-up through 2022, it said. Such vehicles use gasoline to power the car's motor, requiring a much smaller battery than EVs and therefore are less expensive to produce. 
""The heart of our strategy in terms of electrification is battery EVs and e-Power technology,"" Nissan Chief Planning Officer Philippe Klein told reporters at a briefing. He did not disclose Nissan's planned investment in developing the new EVs.
Nissan and its automaking partners, France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), together plan to launch 17 electric models as part of their strategy to achieve annual vehicle sales totaling 14 million units by 2022, compared with 10.6 million units in 2017.
Klein added that road tests for the automaker's self-driving vehicle followed the ""highest safety levels possible"", and that Nissan had no plans to stop testing its technology, following a fatal accident involving a self-driving car operated by Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] in the United States earlier this week.
Global automakers and technology companies are facing mounting pressure to prove that their automated driving functions under development are safe to use on public roads in light of the accident.
Nissan and mobile gaming operator DeNA Co (T:2432) earlier this month held public field tests of their Easy Ride self-driving taxi service in Yokohama. They plan to offer the service beginning in Japan in the early 2020s.
The automaker is also planning to equip 20 of its models, mostly in developed markets, with automated driving functions including self-driving capabilities on city roads by 2022. 

As part of their mid-term strategy through 2022, Nissan and its automaking partners Renault and Mitsubishi Motors plan to launch a total of 40 vehicles with autonomous drive (AD) technology and become an operator of self-driving, ride-hailing services.

The six countries included Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico.
""I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports from steel articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to exempt steel articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time,"" according to the proclamation published by the White House on Thursday. 
The news came after Trump launched the long-promised anti-China tariffs on Thursday.
A presidential memorandum signed by Trump said the U.S. would target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods that are “misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property” with tariffs.
“I view them (China) as a friend,” Trump said as he made his announcement on Thursday. “We have spoken to China and we are in the middle of negotiations.”
In response, China unveiled plans on Friday for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the U.S. China planned to add 15% tariffs on U.S. steel pipes, fruit, wine and other products, the country’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, adding that the country also planned to add 25% tariffs on pork and recycled aluminum.
""China doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but is not afraid of engaging in one,"" the Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement.
The Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component extended their losses from the morning and plunged more than 4% at 2:15am ET (06:15 GMT) following the development. China urged the U.S. to resolve any trade disputes via dialogue, stressing that the country is not afraid of a trade war, and that it is ready to take legal actions against the U.S. under the WTO framework.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dived 3.1%. Stocks that are most exposed to the U.S. took the biggest hit.
WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), which bought U.S.-based pig giant Smithfield Foods in 2013 slid 10%. Apple supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018) fell more than 5%.
Index heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) fell as much as 8% earlier in the day after its largest shareholders Naspers sold a 2% stake in the company. Tencent regained some ground in afternoon trading but was still down 5.3%. Casino Operator  Wynn Macau  Ltd (HK:1128)slid 3.5% after former Wynn Resorts CEO Steven Wynn sold his remaining shares in the company.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei closed 4.7% lower. The country’s CPI came in at 1% in February, matching the median estimate but still far away from its target of 2%.
Bank of Japan's Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said on Friday that the data showed inflationary pressure is insufficient and that he wanted to maintain the current policy regime to meet the central bank's 2% target.
Elsewhere, the KOSPI was down 3.3%. Reports that Vietnam and South Korea agreed to raise their bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2020 caught some attention.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 04:03AM ET</span>","As Toshiba's $18 billion chip unit sale faces tight deadline, IPO looms","By Makiko Yamazaki and Taro Fuse
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp faces a Friday deadline to win Chinese antitrust approval to sell its prized $18 billion memory-chip business by end-March, raising the possibility the deadline may be missed and that it will seek alternatives such as an IPO.
The conglomerate agreed last year to sell the world's second-biggest producer of NAND flash memory chips to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital to plug a huge financial hole left by the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. 
The company has been aiming to complete the sale by March 31, the end of its business year. It said in September that it would need approval from antimonopoly authorities by March 23 to meet that deadline.
Toshiba no longer faces immediate insolvency or a delisting even if it does not meet the end-March deadline for the sale as it has raised funds from a share issue late last year. But the deal is still key to its plan to rebound from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal and a crisis in the nuclear power business.
One source briefed on the matter said the chance of finalizing the sale by end-March is slim, since China had not yet given its antitrust approval. 
Another source with direct knowledge of the matter said antitrust approval must come by early next week, if not on Friday, if it were to meet the deadline.
Missing the end-March deadline for the sale of the chip unit to the Bain consortium gives Toshiba the option of walking away without penalties, people briefed on the matter said. 
Those people said Toshiba could listen to activist shareholders who oppose the sale saying the $18 billion price tag undervalues the business. Hong Kong-based Argyle Street Management, a hedge fund with $1.2 billion under management, has said the board should consider an IPO instead.
A Toshiba spokesman said the company continues its effort to close the deal by the end of this month. Bain declined to comment.
China's commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
The sources asked not to be named because the information is private.
The flash memory chip business has been the source of most of Toshiba's earnings as the company struggles to grow other core businesses such as social infrastructure.

Toshiba shares closed 2.5 percent lower on Friday. They rose earlier this year but have given up the gains to be flat so far in 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war sent stock markets sliding on Friday and investors rushing for the safety of currencies like the yen and government bonds, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods.
Another bruising week for stocks has left global equity markets heading for their first quarterly loss since early 2016 after a spike in volatility, nervousness about rising inflation and the specter of a trade war spooked investors enjoying a multi-year bull run.
European stocks fell, with Germany's Dax down 1.4 percent, the French CAC 40 1.3 percent lower and Britain's FTSE 100 0.4 percent in the red.
That followed large falls in the U.S. and overnight in Asia, although futures pricing pointed to a slight recovery for U.S. stocks when they opened on Friday.

Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect.
China urged the United States to ""pull back from the brink"", but investors fear Trump's tariffs are leading the world's two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy.
China disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.
The MSCI World Index, down around 3.4 percent since Monday, is on course for its worst week since early February when a spike in volatility sent markets into a tailspin. 
""The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,"" said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist. 
With investors seeking out safer assets, many have jumped into government bond markets in Europe and the United States. 
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which fell almost 8 basis points on Thursday, rose on Friday but were still set for their biggest two-week fall since November.
In Europe, benchmark issuer Germany's 10-year bond yields hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent. While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they were still on track for their biggest two-week drop since November.
FLIGHT TO YEN
Many investors also turned to the yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war. 
The Japanese currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar.
The Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro.
The dollar dropped 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies.
""The FX market itself isn't sure, and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to buy the yen and the Swiss franc,"" Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), wrote in a daily note.

In response, China announced plans on Friday for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the U.S. China planned to add 15% tariffs on U.S. steel pipes, fruit, wine and other products, the country’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, adding that the country also planned to add 25% tariffs on pork and recycled aluminum.
Meanwhile, China's embassy in Washington said Beijing would “fight to the end” in any trade war with the United States.
“We will retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer,” Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted to the embassy's Facebook account.
Major industrials in the U.S. that could become targets of Chinese trade retaliation plunged further, with aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) down 5.2% and earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) falling 5.7%.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index plunged 3.2%. Stocks that are most exposed to the US took the biggest hit.
WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), which bought U.S. based pig giant Smithfield Foods in 2013 slid 10%. Apple supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018) fell more than 5%. Index heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) fell as much as 8% after Naspers sold a 2% stake in the company.  Wynn Macau  Ltd (HK:1128) slid 3.5% after former Wynn Resorts CEO Steven Wynn sold his remaining shares in the company.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei dived 3.8%. The country’s CPI came in at 1% in February, matching the median estimate but still far away from its target of 2%.
Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said on Friday that the data showed inflationary pressure is insufficient and that he wanted to maintain the current policy regime to meet the central bank's 2% target.
Elsewhere, the KOSPI was down 2.3%. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) chairman Kwon Oh-hyun said he expected uncertainty from trade protectionism and geopolitical risk to persist throughout the year.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 11:13PM ET</span>",Boeing will not appeal trade case against Bombardier: spokesman,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will not appeal against the U.S. trade commission ruling that allows Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties, a Boeing spokesman said on Thursday.
The decision by Boeing puts the trade challenge to rest. A Canadian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Boeing's decision was ""good news"".
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) unanimously voted in January to reject Boeing's complaint and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat Bombardier CSeries jets for five years.
The ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, the world's largest maker of jetliners, which accused Bombardier of dumping the planes, or selling them below cost, in the U.S. market.
However, the ITC said it rejected placing duties on Bombardier jets partly because Boeing had lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.
The ITC ruled the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta and Boeing's smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete.
The smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers. Airbus SE (PA:AIR) has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).
The Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal. 
It was not yet clear how Boeing's decision will impact the planemaker's relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion. 

A Bombardier spokesman was not immediately available to comment.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) saw its shares down 4.51 percent at the midday trading break on Friday after the internet firm's largest shareholder,  Naspers Ltd  (J:NPNJn), said it would lower its stake for the first time in 17 years.
The Hong Kong-listed stock opened 7.8 percent lower at HK$405, its lowest opening price since Feb. 9, before regaining ground to HK$419.6 by noon. The benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) was down 2.81 percent.
A day earlier, the stock fell 5 percent following Tencent's late Wednesday report showing quarterly revenue missed estimates as well as expectations of margin pressure, although profit beat forecasts.
Friday's decline wiped $24 billion off Tencent's market value, though at $508 billion, it is still Asia's most valuable listed company and fifth globally behind Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
South African media and e-commerce group Naspers said on Thursday it planned to sell up to 190 million Tencent shares, or 2 percent of its holding, in a sale that could earn Naspers up to $11 billion. It also said it had no plans to further reduce its holding for the next three years.
""The funds will reinforce Naspers' balance sheet and be invested in classifieds, online food delivery and fintech globally,"" said CICC analyst Natalie Wu. ""We think it is a good opportunity to buy into dips given Tencent's solid fundamentals.""
Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said, ""Given Naspers' largest single shareholding and board representation in Tencent, we believe its stake sale is unlikely to be a reaction to Tencent's quarterly results. Instead of a timed profit-taking move, we believe this is more to improve Naspers' own free cash flow and allow it higher flexibility in pursuing investment opportunities.""

A Tencent spokeswoman said it was informed and supportive of Naspers' decision, and that Naspers' intention to keep its remaining stake for the next three years demonstrated its confidence in Tencent.

1579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",PetroChina Pays Full Profit as Oil Rally Keeps Cash Churning,"(Bloomberg) -- PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest oil and gas company, once again rewarded shareholders by paying out its entire net income as dividends.
After a surprise payout from its half-year results in August, the Beijing-based company said Thursday it will send investors dividends that amount to slightly more than its 22.8 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in 2017 net income.
“Shareholders should be happy that PetroChina once again paid out all of its profit as dividend,” said Anna Yu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at ICBC International Research Ltd. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. holds almost 83 percent of the company.
PetroChina is recovering from its worst-ever performance the previous year as a rally in oil prices bolstered its exploration and production segment. Global benchmark Brent crude averaged 21 percent higher in 2017 than a year ago as OPEC and its allies cut output. And while the state-owned giant took a 23.9 billion yuan hit from reselling imported gas domestically below cost, those losses are seen having peaked.
As the country’s biggest natural gas producer and importer, PetroChina is key to President Xi Jinping’s campaign to replace coal with the cleaner-burning fuel. The nation’s gas use surged 15 percent last year, with imports satisfying around 40 percent of that demand, pushing up global prices this winter while leaving some parts of the country short of supply.
PetroChina will hand out dividends totaling 0.06074 yuan per share, including special payments. Given that free cash flow hit a record $24 billion, the dividend payout was “uninspiring,” Aditya Suresh, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in research note.
Profit in 2017, which almost tripled, compares with the 23.1 billion yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts and the company’s forecast of as much as 23.9 billion yuan in January.
Impairments more than doubled as the company wrote down the value of petrochemical and pipeline assets. Spending, which rose for the first time in five years, overshot its target by 13 percent. PetroChina plans to boost expenditure by about 4 percent this year.
“The conservative capital expenditure implies the free cash flow yield will remain excellent in 2018,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. In terms of dividend yield, PetroChina is less attractive than state-owned peers China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and Cnooc Ltd., the bank’s analysts wrote.
Shares of PetroChina fell 3.1 percent to HK$5.36 as of 9:44 a.m. in Hong Kong amid a broader equity sell-off as trade tensions escalated between the U.S. and China. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 3.4 percent.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 01:49AM ET</span>",China gives Baidu go-ahead for self-driving tests after U.S. crash,"By Adam Jourdan and Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's capital city has given the green light to tech giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) to test self-driving cars on city streets, indicating strong support for the budding sector even as the industry reels from a fatal accident in the United States.
Beijing's move is an important step as China looks to bolster its position in the global race for autonomous vehicles, where regulatory concerns have come into the spotlight since the crash earlier this month.
The accident in Tempe, Arizona, involving an Uber self-driving car, was the first death attributed to a self-driving car operating in autonomous mode, and has ramped up pressure on the industry to prove its software and sensors are safe.
Beijing has given Baidu, best known as China's version of search engine Google, a permit to test its autonomous vehicles on 33 roads spanning around 105 kilometers (65 miles) in the city's less-populated suburbs, the firm said in a statement.
Baidu is leading China's push in driverless technology, with Beijing keen to keep up with global rivals such as Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It has a major self-driving project called Apollo.
""With supportive policies, we believe that Beijing will become a rising hub for the autonomous driving industry,"" Baidu Vice-President Zhao Cheng said in the statement. 
Two people close to DiDi Chuxing, China's dominant ride-hailing company which is also working on self-driving, said earlier this week firms developing autonomous vehicles were not likely to slow down plans for testing and developing
""I am quite positive on the potential of the technology because autonomous technology makes vehicles far less prone to accidents than human drivers,"" one of the people said.
Didi declined to comment.
Earlier this month China issued licenses to auto makers allowing self-driving vehicles to be road tested in Shanghai, which included Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp Ltd and electric vehicle start-up NIO.
Regulations in the sector are, however, still catching up with fast growth and increasing numbers of firms wanting to carry out tests on public roads.
Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li tested his firm's driverless car on Beijing's roads last July, stirring controversy as there were no rules for such a test at the time. The firm hopes to get self-driving cars onto the roads in China by 2019.

Baidu said that before conducting tests on public roads, autonomous vehicles using its Apollo system would go through simulation tests as well as trials on closed courses.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Steve Wynn sells stake in company he founded, Macau casino Galaxy buys in","By Farah Master
(Reuters) - Steve Wynn, the former chief executive of Wynn Resorts Ltd, has disposed his entire 11.8 percent stake in the firm for $2.1 billion in a dramatic exit of the casino and hotel enterprise he founded over 16 years ago.
In an unexpected separate move, Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment said it has agreed to buy 5.3 million primary shares of Wynn Resorts at $175 per share, giving them around a 5 percent stake in the operator which has resorts in Las Vegas and Macau.
Galaxy is one of six licensed operators in the world's largest gambling hub of Macau and competes with Wynn along with Sands China, MGM China and Melco Resorts.
The casino mogul’s share sale comes a week after Wynn Resorts said Steve and Elaine Wynn, who has a 9.26 percent stake, had scrapped a shareholder agreement that prevented them from selling their stakes.
Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of the Las Vegas-based company last month, following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. He has denied the accusations.
In a joint statement by Galaxy and Wynn on Wednesday, Galaxy Vice Chairman Francis Lui said it was a unique opportunity to ""acquire an investment in a globally recognised entertainment corporation with exceptionally high quality assets and a significant development pipeline.""
A Galaxy spokeswoman could not comment further on whether Galaxy would look to increase its holding in the future. 
Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox said Galaxy shared many of the same core ""operating philosophies and values.""
The announcement also follows the settlement two weeks ago of long standing litigation between Wynn Resorts and Universal Entertainment Corporation.
Wynn said two long-term institutional investors, currently holding stakes in Wynn Resorts, have agreed to purchase the remaining eight million shares held by Steve Wynn also at $175 a share. 
A Thursday filing showed the embattled founder sold 4.1 million shares of Wynn Resorts at $180 per share - effectively exiting his entire 12.1 million shares, or 11.8 percent stake in the firm, for a total of $2.14 billion. 
WYNN IMPACT
Wynn, who started in Las Vegas casinos in the 1960s, created some of Las Vegas' most iconic landmarks – the Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure Island.
He was forced to sell his multi-billion dollar operation Mirage Resorts to tycoon Kirk Kerkorian in a hostile takeover in 2000. Kerkorian then created MGM Mirage and Wynn went on to create Wynn Resorts with his ex-wife in 2002. 
The 76 year old businessman, whose signature denotes the company's logo, had built two lavish resorts in the former Portuguese colony of Macau where only six firms have licenses to operate casinos. 
Vitaly Umansky, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong, said the implications of the Galaxy's investment goes beyond what looks like a passive move at this stage. 
""Wynn and Galaxy may be looking at collaborating on future development opportunities in Asia, with Japan being the critical development initiative."" 
Galaxy's octogenarian founder Lui Che Woo, one of Asia's wealthiest billionaires, has a net wealth of $22 billion according to Forbes. Lui who started his career in construction has grown his casino company into one of Macau's biggest operators over the past decade.
""There are other large gaming companies who do not have a presence in Macau, but who desperately want to be in Macau, and we would not be surprised to see them angling for a seat at the acquisition table too,"" said Grant Govertsen, analyst at Union Gaming in Macau. 
While Galaxy has been primarily focused on Macau with its three casinos, it this week received a license to operate a roughly $500 million resort in Boracay, the Philippines most famous holiday island. 
Wynn, which operates a resort on Cotai and Macau's main peninsula, focuses on premium and VIP customers, while Galaxy targets both the high end segment and the broader mass. Both companies have reported strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter with Galaxy posting a 67 percent surge in 2017 profit. 
Shares in Wynn Macau and Galaxy dropped 3.9 percent and 2.9 percent respectively on Friday against the benchmark Hang Seng Index which was down 3.1 percent.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd shareholders approved a stock split on Friday making it easier for retail shareholders to hold shares in the tech giant, at an annual meeting also dogged by concerns about global trade tensions. 
The meeting showcased changes the South Korean firm has made in recent years to build investor goodwill, such as strengthening its dividend policy to share the fruits of a memory chip boom that underpinned record profits in 2017. 
Shareholders approved the 50:1 stock split announced in January, as well as the appointment of new board directors. 
But the meeting was overshadowed by prospects of a trade war following U.S. moves to impose anti-China tariffs over what Washington says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property, and Chinese threats of retaliation.
Samsung Electronics is South Korea's biggest exporter, recording $134.7 billion in export sales in 2017, and is vital to global electronics supply chains. 
Outgoing chairman of the board Kwon Oh-hyun told the meeting Samsung Electronics expected uncertainty from trade protectionism and geopolitical risk to remain through 2018. 
""In a broad sense, we expect uncertainties such as trade protectionism and geopolitical risks to persist throughout the year, and the paradigm in the IT industry to keep shifting,"" Kwon said. 
HIGHER CHIP DEMAND 
Co-CEO Kinam Kim told the meeting in Seoul that the company, the world's leading manufacturer of semiconductors, expects demand to increase for value-added memory chips handling large data this year. 
It also expected greater uncertainty in the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel business due to stiffer competition between OLED and liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, and from Chinese LCD makers, said Kim, who heads the company's Device Solutions division. 
On the mobile front, co-CEO and head of the IT & Mobile division, DJ Koh, said the slowdown in mobile market growth was expected to intensify competition this year, making the market environment difficult. 
Samsung Electronics' mobile business, which vies with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for global dominance, needed more time to recover in China following a reorganization of its sales network there last year, he said. The firm's share of the world's biggest smartphone market has fallen below 10 percent in the past year. 
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, who has been out after a year-long detention since receiving a suspended sentence for bribery earlier this year, did not attend. 
Lee, who remains a board director, has not appeared in a public schedule since an early February release.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. steel and aluminum companies were hammered on Thursday as the United States said it would exempt more countries from a tariff on metals imports that has been promoted as invigorating industry.
The S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> tumbled 7.4 percent, its biggest single-day percentage decline since September 2011.
Shares of U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) dropped 11 percent while shares of  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), the lone steel stock in the S&P 500 (SPX), dropped 6.5 percent. 
The steel index fell to its lowest point since Feb. 9 and is now down 9.2 percent since Feb. 28, the day before U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. The duties are set to start on Friday. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a Senate committee hearing that Trump had chosen to ""pause"" the imposition of metals tariffs for Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico South Korea and ""Europe"".
""The exemptions are a path for further competitively priced steel supply, which could help to normalize U.S. pricing relative to global levels,"" said Philip Gibbs, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""There's a growing recognition by the market that current (spot) pricing is unsustainable.""

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) on Thursday signaled an end to revenue declines in North America as the world's largest footwear maker reaps the benefits of its efforts to sell directly to customers and focus on new launches.
The company said it expected revenue in North America to be flat in the fourth quarter and return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019.
Shares of the Dow component rose about 3 percent in extended trading. They had closed down 3 percent at $64.42 in regular trading on reports that William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) had exited the company with a profit of about $100 million.

North America has been a weak spot for Nike as the company battled tough competition from a resurgent Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and as the bankruptcies of sporting goods retailers Sports Authority and Sports Chalet weighed on its supply chain.
Revenue in the region has declined for three straight quarters, including a 6 percent drop in the latest quarter. 
In response, Nike has pivoted toward selling directly to customers and has partnered with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Nike is also banking on its strength in innovation.

China sales jumped 24.3 percent and the company plans to maintain the momentum through the launch of NikePlus membership in the Asian country in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Nike reported a net loss of $921 million, or 57 cents per share in the three months ended Feb. 28, compared with a profit of $1.14 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

1593,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Fed Bostic, Housing Data, Durable Goods on Tap
Following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate hike, investors will turn to a speech by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic for additional clues on the prospect of further monetary policy tightening later in the year. While housing and durable goods data are also slated for Friday. 
A speech by Fed President Raphael Bostic is slated 8:10 a.m. ET. 
New home sales and durable goods data, however, is expected to garner most attention after both economic measures suffered an unexpected slump in January. 
The Commerce Department is expected to report core durable goods orders rebounded 0.5% in February, from a 0.3% slump in the prior month.
In separate report, the Commerce Department is slated to report new home sales for February rose 4.4% to 623,000 units from 593,000 units in January. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.12% to 89.39. 
2. This Means (Trade) War
Investor fears over the prospect of a U.S. trade war was played out in the major U.S. averages Thursday as the Dow slumped more than 700 points.
President Donald Trump unveiled tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese exports, citing China’s unfair seizure of US intellectual property. 
That overshadowed reports confirming that the EU and six other countries will be exempted from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports as investors are braced for the prospect of retaliatory measures from China. 
China reportedly readied plans to hit back with media reports suggesting that China could target agricultural goods important to rural U.S. regions that tend to support Donald Trump.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell more than 3% as investor feared that China could ditch the U.S. aircraft maker for rival Airbus. While FedEx (NYSE:FDX) – with its large presence fell in China – fell 5.14% as investors fear it could be in China’s crosshairs. 
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count In Focus
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after the number of oil rigs operating in the US resumed their upward trend. 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures gave back some their gains on Thursday, settling 2.3% lower at $64.30 a barrel. Sentiment on crude prices, however, remains positive as a rising geopolitical tensions stoked investor expectations that supply disruption could follow.
U.S., Iran tensions are front and centre after President Trump hinted at scrapping the Iran nuclear deal during a visit to the White House by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman (or MBS as his called). 
""A lot of bad things are happening in Iran,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""The deal is coming up in one month, and you will see what happens."" 
“On May 12, the US government will need to decide on the renewal of the waiver of Iranian sanctions, Morgan Stanley said.” “Depending on the outcome, this could affect Iranian exports, including possibly taking a few hundred thousand barrels per day off the market."

FedEx, which operates the world’s largest cargo airline, has a bigger presence in Asia and China than  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS)., having gained a major foothold through its 1989 acquisition of Tiger International Inc. The Memphis, Tennessee-based courier also has a larger international air network than its rival.
“It’s definitely the tariffs on China impacting” FedEx shares, said Kevin Sterling, a Seaport Global Holdings analyst. “If global trade does contract, they’re going to feel it.” FedEx in January opened an air-cargo hub in Shanghai to handle growing cross-border transactions.
Trump’s order sparked a broad market rout on concerns that the levies would trigger a trade war and hurt the broadest global economic recovery in years. FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith on Tuesday warned that the tariffs could threaten U.S. economic health.

“The better approach is to encourage open markets and free exchange of products and services and to reduce barriers to trade,” Smith said on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings.
FedEx fell 3.8 percent to $239.61 at 2:22 p.m. Thursday in New York, after declining as much as 5.2 percent, the most since Feb. 9. UPS slipped 1.8 percent.
Results for FedEx’s fiscal third quarter also may have weighed on the shares, said Lee Klaskow, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. While the courier’s Freight and Ground operations performed well, “there were some concerns” regarding its Express airline unit, the largest at the company, he said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer within 15 days will propose a list of products that will carry higher tariffs."
1599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 02:42PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to reap $1.7 billion from asset management IPO,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS set the price for its initial public offering on Thursday at a level which is expected to generate proceeds of about 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) for Germany's largest bank. 
The valuation of 32.50 euros per share is less than  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had originally hoped for, but the start of trading for DWS in Frankfurt on Friday will mark a tangible milestone in Chief Executive John Cryan's struggle to restructure the lender.
The listing of DWS, more than a year in the making, is expected to be one of Germany's biggest this year and is part of a broader overhaul which Deutsche Bank hopes will move it on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals. 
The IPO was brought forward to lock in the valuation ahead of any further stock market correction.
DWS said on Thursday that 44.5 million shares had been placed with investors, a smaller than expected 22.25 percent of its shares. The placement price gives the asset management business a market capitalization of 6.5 billion euros. 
Originally, Deutsche Bank had hoped to generate proceeds of up to 2 billion euros by selling 25 percent of DWS, giving the unit a value of 8 billion euros. 
During the listing process, the bank scaled back its expectations but did find big investors, including insurer Nippon Life of Japan and investment company Tikehau Capital. Nippon agreed to acquire a 5 percent stake.
A successful IPO will be a relief for Deutsche, which has been dogged by three years of losses in a row. 
The bank's shares fell sharply on Wednesday after its finance chief warned of headwinds for its investment bank in the first quarter.
But Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke was optimistic about DWS.
""It's a revenue stream, it's capital-light, it's higher margin and it's higher growth we think than many of our businesses,"" von Moltke told an investor conference in London.

(Reuters) - Investor William Ackman has stepped out of his  Nike  (N:NKE) sneakers, at least in a financial sense.
The billionaire investor's hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management earned roughly $100 million in profit when it cashed out of its 0.71 percent stake in the sportswear company recently, a person familiar with the move said on Thursday.
Two months ago, the activist investor told clients that Pershing Square had taken a rare passive stake in Nike at the end of 2017, when the stock was trading at around $53 a share and that the bet had already earned them a roughly 30 percent gain.
Ackman, a passionate tennis player, is often photographed on courts wearing Nike apparel ranging from shoes to shirts to wrist bands.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the hedge fund's exit from the Dow component.
The quick gains on Nike will be welcome news for Ackman's investors who have watched him post losses for three consecutive years when long-held investments on Valeant (TO:VRX) and against  Herbalife  (N:HLF) weighed on returns. He exited Valeant last year and got out of Herbalife earlier this year.
In January, Ackman told his investors that he was making changes to return the prominent firm to its glory days by shrinking his team, becoming more involved in the investment process again and leaving the marketing to someone else.. The firm generated compound returns of 21 per cent a year net of fees over 11 years from its launch to the end of 2014. Then it lost money in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
So far, he has largely stuck to his plans to keep a lower profile. There was no big announcement that he had exited Herbalife and there was not much fanfare around the Nike investment either.
Still, Ackman's private hedge funds are again in the red for 2018, nursing losses of roughly 3.7 percent as the broader stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is roughly flat for the year.
Pershing Square, which traditionally makes investments where it seeks to make changes in the board room, has left Nike at roughly the same time the company is grappling with issues surrounding its culture. There have been complaints about workplace behavior and Trevor Edwards, an executive who had been seen as a possible successor to the CEO, is leaving.

Nike is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday.

U.S.-based investment bank Goldman has been among the top three since Coalition started compiling the figures in 2010, having a longstanding reputation for generating revenue from commodities trading, derivatives and other activities.
However, last year Goldman's commodities business posted one of its worst results on record and it is now trying to boost performance, creating a new commodities finance team to drum up business from corporate clients.
Coalition said JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley had the largest revenue in the commodities sector last year, followed by Citi. Coalition ranks the twelve largest investment banks. It did not provide revenue figures.
Last year Goldman led the rankings, followed by JPMorgan and Citi in third place. Morgan Stanley was last placed in the top three in 2014, when it ranked third.
Banks' commodity revenues have been on a steady downward path in recent years as they exited or shrank their commodity businesses due to more stringent regulation and poor performance from the sector.
Revenue in the commodities sector at the 50 biggest investment banks was $4.3 billion last year, the lowest in more than a decade and down from $15.9 billion in 2008 at the peak of the commodities cycle, according to Coalition.

The twelve banks included in Coalition's ranking are Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Barclays  (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Citi,  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs, HSBC (L:HSBA), JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UBS (S:UBSG).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) on Thursday won the dismissal of an investor lawsuit claiming it concealed food safety risks, causing its stock to drop after widely publicized outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in 2014 and 2015.
U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in Manhattan said that while the outbreaks were cause for concern, the lawsuit failed to support its claim that Chipotle defrauded investors.
The judge wrote that she was ""as concerned as the parties about foodborne illness outbreaks,"" but that ""not all adverse events are the product of corporate misfeasance or nonfeasance.""
Failla dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again. She had dismissed an earlier version of the case last March.
A lawyer for the investors, which include the Construction Laborers Pension Trust of Greater St. Louis and Germany’s Metzler Investment GmbH, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for Chipotle also could not immediately be reached.
Chipotle was linked to a series of outbreaks of salmonella, E. coli and norovirus in 2014 and 2015, causing sales to plummet. Chipotle's share price fell 47 percent in just over five months from its August 2015 peak above $758.
In their 2016 lawsuit, the investors claimed that in statements made to investors in 2015 and early 2016 the Denver-based company failed to disclose changes in its food handling practices, recorded cases of customer illness and details about its plans for dealing with the widely publicized outbreaks. 
The investors had also brought claims against Chipotle's founder and Executive Chairman Steve Ells, former Co-Chief Executive Monty Moran and Chief Financial Officer John Hartung individually.

The judge said that although the newer version added more details, it failed to point to any specific instances of Chipotle or the executives knowingly making statements or failing to disclose information that would be material to investors.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico reaches deal to access U.S. disaster loans,"By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department and storm-ravaged Puerto Rico say they have reached a deal to let the bankrupt U.S. territory access billions of dollars in long-disputed federal loans to help it recover from last year's Hurricane Maria.
In a joint news conference on Thursday in San Juan, broadcast on the internet, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the island can access the so-called community disaster loans (CDLs) as needed until March 2020, once its cash balance dwindles below $1.1 billion. 
The agreement still needs approval by the federally-appointed board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances, as well as the judge presiding over its $120 billion bankruptcy.
Spokesmen for the board had no immediate comment on Thursday.
The dispute over the loan had ratcheted up tensions between Puerto Rico and Washington, as the island battles the aftermath of its biggest natural disaster in 90 years, while navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history. It also raised questions about the reliability of Puerto Rico's financial record-keeping. 
The U.S. Congress in October appropriated $4.9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but while the Virgin Islands were allowed access to the funds - and have drawn down around $200 million so far - Puerto Rico was not. 
The island's leadership warned that devastation from September's Hurricane Maria could cause it to run out of cash, but the U.S. Treasury, along with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, found that Puerto Rico had $1.7 billion in its coffers.
Last month, the Treasury said it would consider allowing access to around $2 billion, but only under conditions that Rossello called ""extremely difficult"" in a Feb. 26 letter to U.S. lawmakers. He complained, in the same letter, of Treasury's ""arbitrary conduct"" in denying access.
Under Thursday's accord, Puerto Rico can begin accessing money on an as-needed basis, once its cash reserves dip below $1.1 billion. It remains unclear how much Puerto Rico may initially draw down, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told Reuters on Thursday. 
Rossello thanked Mnuchin at the news conference, saying, ""When there are issues to be resolved, the best way to do it is principal to principal, face to face."" 
Mnuchin, who stopped on the island on his way back from the G20 meetings in Argentina, said it ""was very important"" to meet with Rossello to ""make sure we resolve whatever issues we had.""
Puerto Rico was already in bankruptcy, battling near-insolvent health and pension systems and a decade-long recession, when Maria hit on Sept. 20.

The storm killed dozens and decimated the island's already substandard housing stock and electric grid. Thousands remain without power six months later.

Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi resigned, as expected, after having accepted a position at a company earlier this year. Other seven directors stepped down, effective April 24, to allow shareholders to vote a fully new board. 
Those directors hope ""this move would help to clarify and provide certainty to the governance of the company, passing the responsibility of appointing the new board to the shareholders' meeting"", the company said in a statement.

Earlier this month Elliott Advisors said it had taken a stake in TIM and proposed to replace six board members in a bid to improve strategy, value and governance and shake up the way top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) runs the company.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Boeing loyalist Ryanair to fly first Airbus with Austria deal,"By Conor Humphries and Victoria Bryan
DUBLIN/BERLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair's (I:RYA) plan to buy Laudamotion will add Airbus (PA:AIR) planes to the Irish low-cost carrier's fleet for the first time and could herald an improvement in relations with the European planemaker.
The acquisition by one of the world's biggest airlines, which now operates 430 Boeing (N:BA) 737s, marks an unusual step in the low-cost business, where carriers tend to stick to a single aircraft type to keep costs down and operations simple.
The move to buy 75 percent of Vienna-based Laudamotion could also signal a shift to form a multi-airline group in the low-cost business, mirroring traditional operators such as IAG (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) that each run several carriers.
But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary is starting small with Airbus, although he said he had harbored aspirations to develop an Airbus fleet at Ryanair for ""some years"".
The Laudamotion deal gives Ryanair 15 Airbus A320, with plans to double that in three years. By comparison, Ryanair aims to have 570 Boeing 737s in five years, ensuring it stays one of the biggest clients for the Seattle-based firm even as it forms a new link with the European manufacturer.
""This obviously gives them more bargaining power,"" said Mark Simpson, an analyst at broker Goodbody, which has a ""buy"" rating for Ryanair. ""If they are going to 600 aircraft, do you have 400 Boeing and 200 Airbus? It gives them flexibility.""
To keep costs down, Ryanair could choose to operate either Boeing or Airbus out of each base but not mix them, he said.
Ryanair's ties with Airbus have been strained over the years. Former Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retired at the end of 2017, was furious at O'Leary for giving the impression he was about to sign a deal for 100 aircraft in 2002 before squeezing a better deal from Boeing.
O'Leary has always declined to comment on the issue.
But the departure of Leahy, who refused to pitch to O'Leary for a big 200-plane order in 2009, might change the dynamics.
""Airbus never wanted to play ball with Ryanair, but it could be a new start with changes to the Airbus sales team and top management,"" aviation consultant John Strickland said.
""VALUED CUSTOMER"" 
Ryanair has ordered 40 737s and 200 737 Max aircraft, part of plans to carry 200 million passengers a year by 2024. 
A Boeing spokesman did not comment on O'Leary's remark that he had long aspired to an Airbus fleet, saying: ""We look forward to continuing to meet the requirements of a valued customer.""
O'Leary, who has donned a Seattle Seahawks American football shirt and delivered rousing speeches to Boeing workers, is credited for saving hundreds of jobs at the U.S. planemaker when he put in the order for 100 aircraft in 2002.
Airbus may yet balk at trying to win O'Leary into a big order, in a bid to avoid a price war that might anger its own top buyers, like easyJet (L:EZJ), if they believed a rival low-cost carrier was securing a better deal for aircraft.
But the growing size and clout of low-cost carriers means Ryanair is not alone in building bridges beyond traditional suppliers. Industry sources say a top easyJet executive was the guest speaker at a recent internal Boeing event.
""It's not about today, but it is about keeping networks intact,"" one industry official told Reuters.
Building broader relationships in the industry would make sense if Ryanair or easyJet ever moved to add wide-body jets to their fleet. Ryanair has previously said it would launch long-haul routes if it secured the right aircraft at the right price. 
O'Leary said on Tuesday that Laudamotion would operate as a separate entity in the Ryanair group, a move he also proposed when trying to acquire former Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, another Airbus operator. The airline eventually went to IAG. 
An investment banker who has advised Ryanair and IAG at different times said he expected O'Leary to build up a group of several airlines, starting with Ryanair, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, which is a charter carrier based in Poland with five planes. 
""You create a group of airlines to compete with each other intensely - a kind of an IAG for low-cost carriers,"" he said. 
Ryanair is not alone in facing more complexity with an acquisition. All-Boeing operator Alaska Airlines bought Airbus operator Virgin America in 2016 for $2.6 billion. 
Still, some industry experts expect Alaska to switch back to Boeing, albeit when the Virgin America leases for Airbus planes expire in about 2022-2024. Similarly, they say O'Leary is unlikely to shift to Airbus with a big deal soon.
""But it serves as a reminder to Boeing,"" Strickland said, ""never to become complacent.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has pushed for a budget increase to fund its job of overseeing the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market, said on Thursday it was ""absolutely astounded"" that the U.S. Congress is preparing to cut its funding.
The CFTC would receive $249 million in a recently released government funding bill that Congress is trying to pass before midnight Friday. That is $1 million less than the CFTC's current budget, driving the regulator and its chairman, Christopher Giancarlo, to directly criticize Congress.
""We are absolutely astounded by the decrease in the CFTC’s budget,"" said Erica Elliott Richardson, the CFTC's director of public affairs. ""Chairman Giancarlo takes this budget decrease incredibly personally, and is currently meeting with our finance team to figure out a path forward for the agency.”
When the funding bill was unveiled late Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee said the funding level would ""ensure robust swaps, futures, and options markets while prioritizing resources.""
For years, the CFTC has argued its budget is insufficient, given its expanded responsibilities monitoring derivatives following the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Its budget has been flat for four years.
The agency actually went so far as to split with the White House in 2017, asking for $31.5 million more in funding than the Trump administration requested.
The CFTC had requested the same amount, $281.5 million, in its most recent budget request in February. The new White House budget proposed levying $31.5 million in fees on derivatives users to grow the agency's budget.

Giancarlo told lawmakers in March it represented ""the level of funding necessary to fulfill our statutory mission.""

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 01:19PM ET</span>",Bank regulators to revise capital rules for trading risk,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators plan to revise rules determining the minimum amount of capital banks must set aside to cover risk from trading stocks, bonds, derivatives and currencies.
The alterations are expected to make it easier for banks to apply the rules when they come into effect in January 2022, the Basel Committee, made up of banking regulators from the world's main financial centers, said on Thursday.
The changes are expected to slightly lower the capital hit on banks. Market risks account for a small percentage of a bank's total capital buffer, though it can be far higher for some of the world's biggest trading banks.
The rules from 2016, known as the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, form part of the Basel III accord agreed by the Group of 20 Economies in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis that left taxpayers bailing out banks which were found to be dramatically undercapitalised. 
""The requirements as they stood would have had a negative impact on banks' trading book activities, and their ability to provide financing and hedging solutions to end users,"" Mark Gheerbrant, head of risk and capital at global derivatives industry body ISDA, said.
A key revision is to the ""Profit and Loss Attribution"" test that determines whether a bank can use its own internal model to tot up trading risks and determine how much capital to hold.
If it fails, it would have to use the typically more conservative ""standard"" calculation set out by regulators.
ISDA said the proposal to add an amber warning to the pass or fail in the original rules should smooth a trading desk’s transition to the standard approach if it fails the test, avoiding a ""cliff effect"" or sudden increase in capital requirements.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 06:59PM ET</span>",Citi sets restrictions on gun sales by retail clients,"By Ross Kerber and David Henry
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) added restrictions on firearms sales for new retail-sector clients, the Wall Street bank said on Thursday, the strongest move to date by a major U.S. lender following last month's high school shooting in Florida. 
In an emailed statement Citi said it will require those clients only sell firearms to customers who have passed a background check, restrict firearms sales for buyers under 21, and not sell so-called ""bump stocks"" or high-capacity magazines.
The new rules could be seen as somewhat symbolic since they are unlikely to directly affect a large share of business at the bank, which had total assets of $1.8 trillion at Dec. 31. They come weeks after a shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people, the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history.
Major retailers and at least one online lender have taken similar steps since the shooting brought new calls for gun safety measures and tighter restrictions. 
So far other major banks and financial services firms have focused more on their communications or talks with the weapons industry, including outreach by Bank of America (N:BAC) and asset manager BlackRock Inc. (N:BLK)
Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a Washington, D.C. group seeking weapons restrictions, said Citi's steps demonstrate changes other financial firms could make.
She praised Citi's stance on requiring completion of background checks, since current law allows dealers to sell weapons if a background check does not come back in three days. Citi's move, she said, ""is a next big step.""
Lawrence G. Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the firearms industry, said in a statement, ""These policies do nothing to add to public safety and, in fact, may put vulnerable Americans at greater risk to be victims of crime."" He called Citi's action ""virtue signaling.""
Citi said that in addition to the policy for new clients, it is starting talks with current clients on their practices and if they do not adopt changes the bank will help ""transition their business away from Citi.""
In the e-mailed statement, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said its new policy ""was designed to respect the rights of responsible gun owners while helping to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.""
Corbat, who called himself ""an avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner,"" said Citi also will start talks with other finance companies on possible additional steps to improve gun safety. It will also speak with clients that make guns, though the bank has few such relationships, he said.
By most measures the weapons industry represents a small slice of Citi's overall business. It was not among bank groups that arranged loans or bonds for gunmakers Vista Outdoor, Remington or American Outdoor Brands (O:AOBC) in recent years, according to a review by Thomson Reuters' IFR unit.
Citi was however the lead bank on a recent $550 million bond issue by  Olin Corp  (N:OLN), and since 2012 has participated in three other debt sales for the chemical company that owns ammunition maker Winchester, according to IFR data.
Ed Skyler, executive vice president for global public affairs, said in an interview that Citigroup realizes its tighter rules on guns could cost some business from customers who disagree.
""Our eyes are wide open about what some of the impacts could be,"" he said.
Some gun-control advocates have suggested banks and companies involved in payments could restrict sales at certain specialized gun dealers tagged as ""bad apples"" for loose compliance with gun laws.
Citigroup declined to comment on the idea though it noted in a blog that current payment systems do not allow it to see exactly what items customers are buying at the checkout aisle. 

Citi provides store-branded credit cards to various retailers. None currently sell guns but if Citi were in talks with such a retailer, Skyler said, ""we would want to see these best practices used at their point-of-sale.""

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: China to respond to U.S. tariffs, resist protectionism - WTO envoy","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - China is preparing a range of responses to planned U.S. tariffs and will stand up to protectionism, but still hopes for dialogue, Beijing's ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Thursday.
Zhang Xiangchen said China was considering a WTO complaint against the package of tariffs that President Donald Trump was expected to announce later on Thursday.
""This is a legitimate right for China to do that. But I would not exclude other options because, if the flood approaches, you have to bank up to keep it out,"" he told Reuters. 
Zhang spoke before a senior White House official said Trump would sign a memorandum later on Thursday to potentially slap tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports over forced transfer of intellectual property.
The announcement is the first in a string of U.S. trade restrictions to be aimed squarely at China.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the tariffs would target China's high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States.
Trump's protectionist trade policies have already caused a global outcry this year. 
In January, he slapped steep import tariffs on solar panels and washing machines and this month worldwide steel and aluminum tariffs have followed, justified by a claim to ""national security"" under a Cold War-era law. 
The European Union, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil and South Korea won exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs, Canada and Mexico, Lighthizer said on Thursday.
Asked about the exemptions, Zhang said that ""appeasement of protectionism"" would not work. ""If you surrender to protectionism, you will lose your credibility.""
The United States hopes that the national security claim will make the steel and aluminum tariffs immune to a challenge, but Zhang said they failed to pass the WTO test of being ""essential"" for national security. 
""No one has seen the essential national security rationale behind the U.S. measures,"" he said. ""Even the senior officials of the United States fail to hide the real reasons.""
'A FLAVOR OF TRADE WAR'
Thursday's tariffs, under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, would be even more difficult to defend, Zhang said, because in a previous ruling Washington promised to deploy them only with authorization from the WTO.
""The U.S. commitment is still there. But it seems that today they would like to ignore it. This issue can be brought back to the WTO and it will be challenged again.""
China and other WTO members might also retaliate against the solar tariffs with their own tariffs on U.S. goods, Zhang said.
""My colleagues in the capital have been preparing those options and this response. We still cherish the multilateral trading system very much, although there’s a flavor of trade war in the air.""
Asked about a possible U.S. WTO complaint about currency manipulation, Zhang said China had been prepared for such an argument since Trump mentioned it during his election campaign. 
China is already under U.S. pressure at the WTO for its industrial overcapacity and its cyber security law. 
Asked if China would invoke national security to avoid a WTO dispute over cyber security, Zhang said China would exercise self-restraint.
As well as deploying tariffs, the United States has undermined the WTO's ability to cope with disputes by vetoing the appointment of new appeals judges. 
""If the United States has the intention to paralyze the system no one can stop this,"" he said, adding that China would keep trying to persuade Trump to unblock the system, although some in Geneva were talking about a plan B for the dispute settlement mechanism. 

Zhang said he hoped for good relations with new U.S. ambassador Dennis Shea, who he said had promised to discuss the issue, and he did not want to consider a scenario of the WTO without the United States.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Secret buyers of luxury properties in Britain face jail in new crackdown,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Frontmen who help wealthy investors from Russia and other states use foreign shell companies to hide the ownership of luxury London properties face up to two years in jail and unlimited fines, Britain's government said on Thursday.
The punishments will be included in draft laws to be passed in the summer that will compel foreign companies which own or buy property to disclose their ultimate owners in a bid to crack down on money-laundering.
Investors from Russia, China and the Middle East have poured billions into London, buying everything from luxury properties to entire companies, but the origin of some of those funds has been questioned by transparency campaigners.
London property especially has attracted foreign buyers thanks to its mix of top-end apartments, luxury penthouses and gleaming skyscrapers alongside corporations who use the city as global hub.
Although the new laws are not specifically directed at Russia, the British capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"" due to the large amounts of Russian money that have poured in since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Some British lawmakers have urged Prime Minister Theresa May to freeze the private assets of senior members in Russian President Vladimir Putin's circle in retaliation for the poisoning of a former double agent in England two weeks ago.
""The UK is taking a leading role in the global fight against corruption, including cracking down on the use of shell companies to launder dirty money by buying up some of London's prime real estate,"" Andrew Griffiths, a junior business minister said in a statement.
""Our public register will ensure we know who owns UK property wherever they are from and will help authorities come down hard on frontmen seeking to conceal their paymasters' true identities.""
More than 180 million pounds($254 million) worth of property in Britain has been brought under criminal investigation as the suspected proceeds of corruption since 2004, and more than 75 percent of properties currently under investigation use off-shore corporate secrecy, the statement said.
It is unclear how much money is laundered through Britain, but the National Crime Agency has said calculations of between 36 billion pounds and 90 billion pounds are ""a significant underestimate"".

1639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Trump's Plan to Impose Stiff Tariffs on China Rattles Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is set to announce about $50 billion of tariffs against China over intellectual-property violations on Thursday, opening a new front in an escalating global trade skirmish that is shaking financial markets.
The president is considering targeting more than 100 different types of Chinese goods from shoes to electronics, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The value of the tariffs was based on U.S. estimates of economic damage caused by intellectual-property theft by China, the person said.
Stocks fell sharply in Europe and the U.S. on Thursday on concerns the American tariffs may provoke a stern Chinese response, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 300 points before recovering.
It will be Trump’s first trade action directly aimed at China, which he has blamed for the hollowing out of the American manufacturing sector and the loss of U.S. jobs. The decision comes as policy makers including IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde warn of a global trade conflict that could undermine the broadest world recovery in years.
On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce cautioned against the U.S. taking measures ""detrimental to both sides"". The nation strongly opposes such unilateral and protectionist action, and will take ""all necessary measures"" to firmly defend its interests, the ministry said in a statement on its website.
Declaration of ‘War’
""If Trump really signs the order, that is a declaration of trade war with China,” said Wei Jianguo, former vice commerce minister and now an executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-linked think tank.
""China is not afraid, nor will it dodge a trade war,"" Wei said. ""We have plenty of measures to fight back, in areas of automobile imports, soybean, aircraft and chips. On the other hand, Trump should know that this is a very bad idea, and there will be no winner, and there will be no good outcome for both nations.""
U.S. Business Council Says Tariffs on China Do More Harm Than Good
Trump instructed Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last year to probe allegations that China violates U.S. intellectual property. After seven months of investigation, U.S. officials found strong evidence that China uses foreign-ownership restrictions to compel U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms, said an official with the U.S. Trade Representative’s office who spoke to reporters Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. also suspects Beijing directs firms to invest in the U.S. with the purpose of engineering large-scale transfers of technologies that the Chinese government views as strategic, said the USTR official. The investigation also found strong evidence China supports and conducts cyberattacks on U.S. companies to access trade secrets, according to the official.
American officials have been raising their concerns about China’s IP practices since Bill Clinton was president, and Beijing has repeatedly failed to deliver on promises to reform, said the official, adding the administration is still open to discussing the issue with the government of President Xi Jinping. The official declined to comment on the remedies planned, emphasizing it’s Trump’s decision.
""Can Trump tell China what he really wants?"" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. ""What’s his ask? China could make concessions to improve intellectual protection but that won’t solve the trade imbalance problem if that’s something Trump wants. There is a gap here.""
Lighthizer confirmed Wednesday the administration is considering both tariffs and curbs on Chinese investment, among other options. U.S. companies from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). have warned that sweeping sanctions against China could raise consumer prices and hit the stock market.
Did Trump’s Steel Tariffs Start a Global Trade War?: QuickTake
China is preparing to hit back at Trump’s planned sweeping tariffs with levies aimed at industries and states which tend to employ his supporters, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
IP Views
“Our view is that we have a very serious problem of losing our intellectual property, which is really the biggest single advantage of the American economy,” Lighthizer told lawmakers. ""We are losing that to China” in a way that doesn’t reflect economic fundamentals, he said.
Sweeping U.S. tariffs will test the resolve of Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose government has so far reacted in a measured fashion to Trump’s repeated complaints about the U.S.’s record $375 billion deficit with China. The country’s foreign minister said earlier this month, in response to Trump’s decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs, that China would have a “justified and necessary response” to any efforts to incite a trade war.
U.S. Planning Action Against China Over IP in ‘Very Near Future’
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that the nation will further open its economy, including the manufacturing sector, and pledged to lower import tariffs and cut taxes. In opening manufacturing further, China won’t force foreign companies to transfer technology to domestic ones and will protect intellectual property, he said.
A simulation by Oxford Economics suggests a 25 percent U.S. tariff on $60 billion worth of Chinese exports, with comparable retaliation, would reduce China’s growth by about 0.1 percentage point this year and a little less next year, chief Asia economist Louis Kuijs in Hong Kong said in a recent note. There would be a slightly smaller impact on the U.S. economy, he said.
“The key risk is that it does not end with this modest baseline scenario,” said Kuijs, who formerly worked for the World Bank in Beijing. “More measures may follow, and tit-for-tat responses could lead to escalation. Collateral damage in other economies will be significant and could further complicate the trade friction.”
Bloomberg Economics estimates a global trade conflagration could wipe $470 billion off the world economy by 2020.
The Chinese exports most at risk of protectionist measures by the U.S. are ones that compete with U.S.-based production and are produced via Chinese or Asian supply chains with little involvement of U.S. firms and products. Items that fit these criteria include portions of China-made furniture, textiles, shoes, toys, as well as China-branded information technology, electronics and telecom products, said Kuijs
Lighthizer has been probing China’s IP practices under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The law allows Lighthizer, at the president’s discretion, to take broad steps, including tariffs, to correct against any harm against U.S. businesses.
The USTR has argued that China uses a range of practices to force companies to transfer IP, and Chinese entities engage in widespread theft of U.S. trade secrets, as it seeks to become a leader in advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence. U.S. businesses in China have long complained about being forced to hand over technology as the price of gaining access to the market.
Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady on Wednesday cautioned against the U.S. imposing “indiscriminate” tariffs against China and he encouraged a wider public discussion before the U.S. takes new trade measures. It’s “not about backing down, it’s about hitting the target,” said Brady.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Little sign of trade war panic in European equities,"By Tom Pfeiffer 
LONDON (Reuters) - As Donald Trump's 'America First' trade agenda turns from steel imports to Asian technology and intellectual property, a global trade war is now seen as the most serious risk for global investors, according to a recent survey.
The growing protectionist rhetoric has helped push Europe's Stoxx 600 index (STOXX) down more than 2 percent this week. Tech stocks have fallen furthest, not helped by the scandal over misuse of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users' personal data.
For now, though, the reaction of European industrial stocks that could suffer most in a real trade war does not convey a sense of panic.
An index of the region's industrial companies <.MIEU0IN00GEU> fell sharply in early March when the U.S. President proposed import tariffs on steel and aluminum. Since then they have recovered and performed largely in line with their U.S. peers <.MIUS0IN00PUS>. (U.S. MSCI industrials sector index is shown here in orange, European industrials in purple) 
(For a graphic of U.S. vs European industrials since March 1 click http://reut.rs/2G2z9Nu)
The next test comes later on Thursday, when Washington is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on China targeting technology, telecoms and intellectual property. 
Edmund Shing, head of equity derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), notes that U.S. investors have been investing a lot more in foreign equities and emerging markets recently. 
""If you were really worried about trade issues, you wouldn’t necessarily put as much money into EM equities because that will include Mexico but more importantly, China,"" he said. 
This, said Shing, is because investors think Trump's tariff moves are a negotiating tactic to secure better terms with the European Union, China and NAFTA partners ""as opposed to a particular desire to ratchet up on actual tariffs per se"". 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said we are ""probably approaching peak trade risk in the near-term"", while Citi analysts reckon the recent growth in world trade will overcome the impact of tariffs. 
They point to figures showing strong growth in global goods trade volumes in 2017, and note that trade growth has now surpassed global GDP growth once again.
""For now, our base case is for moderate increases in global protectionism and for these to mostly remain targeted at specific sectors,"" they wrote.
Shares in European industries in the firing line of a potential trade war took a hit on March 2 after Trump proposed the steel and aluminum tariffs, and steelmakers have continued to weaken.
(For a graphic of European steelmakers since March 1 click http://reut.rs/2FYZL28) 
But U.S. aerospace companies have underperformed Europe's - possibly reflecting the higher risk of trade retaliation damaging U.S. defense exports. Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets have often been cited as a potential target by China, which has been developing the C919 as part of its civil aerospace ambitions. 
Automakers - big consumers of steel - have had a mixed run, but two of the European manufacturers most exposed to the United States - BMW and Fiat Chrysler - are trading back where they were before Trump's tariff announcement.
The chart below shows European aerospace and autos stocks (purple and blue) have recovered from sharp losses after the Trump announcement to slightly outperform their U.S. counterparts (orange and green).
(For a graphic of U.S. vs Europe aerospace/autos since March 1 click http://reut.rs/2G0xHeA)
""Risks (for the auto industry) are mitigated somewhat by high use of locally produced (c80%) and recycled (c40%) steel,"" Citi analysts said in a note on trade war risk. 
The relative resilience of European industrial stocks can't be explained by an improving economic picture. Euro area PMI data - a key indicator of industrial sentiment - saw their sharpest monthly fall in six years at the end of February, while comparable U.S. indicators are on the up. 
Economists see only a small impact on the global economy of the higher U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. But a full-blown trade war would be something else. 
The OECD projects that a permanent 10 percent rise in trade costs would lower global gross domestic product by 1-1.5 pct in the medium term, in figures cited by Citi analysts. 
European drinks maker shares dropped when Trump’s steel move prompted the European Union to threaten higher tariffs on imported American whiskey. 
Simon Hales, Citi's EMEA beverages analyst, said any EU retaliation around imported American whisky could prompt U.S. retaliation targeting imported EU spirits. 
But for now investors appear to be taking that in their stride.

LONDON (Reuters) - Paris will overtake London as a center for LCH's clearing of a core euro-denominated market after Brexit, the UK-based firm said as it seeks to head off French political demands for Britain to be frozen out.
Euro clearing has become a political battleground since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the bloc next March.
LCH, part of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), dominates clearing in euro-denominated instruments such as debt repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps from its base in Britain and increasingly from its French subsidiary.
France, however, believes that such a crucial role in bulk euro trades should not be handled by a clearing house outside the bloc, as LCH's London unit will be from next March when Britain leaves the European Union.
In what Britain sees as a grab for a core part of the City of London financial district, the EU proposed that ""systemic"" foreign clearing houses processing euro-denominated assets for EU customers must be open to EU supervision.
As a last resort, they should relocate to the bloc.
LCH Chief Executive Daniel Maguire said under a strategy began before Britain voted for Brexit, more euro clearing would move from London to its Paris LCH SA subsidiary.
""In 2018, we are aiming to offer clearing for as many euro-denominated debt repo products in Paris, as in London,"" Maguire told Reuters.
It now offers clearing in Paris in German and Belgian debt, in addition to the existing service for French, Spanish and Italian repo.
""This is about offering a choice to customers, rather than forcing a change. For example, some volume in Belgian debt has moved from London to Paris,"" Maguire said.
""Clearing in euro-denominated repos and debt is currently split equally between London and Paris but we anticipate gradual momentum of these products into LCH SA over time.""
LCH cleared a record 175 trillion euros of repos across its London and Paris units in 2017, helped by expansion in the French capital.
Clearing involves passing stock, bond, derivative and repo trades through a third party backed by a default fund to ensure completion of the transaction even if one side of the deal goes bust.
DISTINCTIONS
France also wants a significant amount of the $873 trillion euro-denominated interest rate swaps (IRS) clearing done out of London last year to move to the single currency area.
But Maguire said policymakers and central bankers such as ECB President Mario Draghi were coming round to see a distinction between products.
Euro bonds and repos play a regional role in directly ""transmitting"" central bank monetary policy, while interest rate swaps are a global market and do not, Maguire said.
""If you make that distinction, then perhaps you can have different approaches to oversight and supervision,"" Maguire said.
 LCH has no plans to voluntarily split its multi-currency IRS pool by enabling IRS clearing in Paris.
Rival Eurex, owned by Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) is stepping up attempts to attract euro IRS clearing and Maguire said he would continue to monitor such competition.
He sought to reassure EU policymakers that LCH would comply with the bloc's derivatives rules after Brexit.
""Our goal is to continue to provide the markets with a range of services, at our very high standards,"" Maguire said.
Since the financial crisis, clearers must show they could collapse without causing a market meltdown, but Maguire said this requirement does not fully reflect steps taken by users of clearers, such as banks to make themselves safer.
Such regulatory overlaps should be simplified to help focus clearers on fire prevention rather than fire fighting, he said.
""Yes, we should have the right degree of enhanced supervision and regulatory oversight, but it needs to be proportionate and service and product specific in order to be both appropriate and effective – in all scenarios,"" Maguire said.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:34AM ET</span>",Four senior UK politicians urge regulator to block Murdoch-Sky deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Four high-profile British lawmakers have called for Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) to be blocked from buying Sky (L:SKYB), saying the mogul will be able to influence its news output despite promises to the contrary. 
Murdoch is locked in a battle with U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) to buy Europe's biggest pay-TV group, with the Australian-born tycoon hampered by his ownership of other assets in Britain including two leading national newspapers. 
In order to gain regulatory approval Fox has offered to guarantee the independence of the Sky News operation by funding it for 10 years and creating a fully independent board to oversee it, a move that led analysts and competition lawyers to say the deal would likely be cleared. 
But four lawmakers who have previously criticized Murdoch's influence in Britain, including the former leader of the opposition Labour party Ed Miliband, said in a letter to the regulator that the offers did not go far enough.
They noted that the chief executive of Sky would still appoint the head of Sky News. ""This is a significant statement because other statements made have tended to imply that the Editorial board will somehow be in charge of the process, not the Sky CEO,"" they said. 
Fox agreed a deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 but it has been repeatedly delayed by the government and regulators. It is likely to learn whether it can take over Sky in the middle of June. 
Fox has said it does not agree with the regulator's objections but has offered to protect Sky News to help secure approval. Fox has agreed to sell a string of assets on to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), including Sky. 
Comcast has offered 12.50 pounds per share or 22.1 billion pounds for Sky compared with Fox's offer of 10.75 pounds per share, but it has not yet made a formal bid and is trying to secure its own regulatory approval. 
The four lawmakers are Miliband; Vince Cable, the leader of the small opposition Liberal Democrats party; Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Conservative Party and Charles Falconer, a former Labour justice minister. 

""We would urge the panel to come to a clear finding in favor of prohibition, consistent with its powerful provisional findings,"" the letter said.

But even then, everyone seemed to agree on one aspect of it: the shorting of volatility made everything worse.
The evidence was largely indisputable, and everyone carried on as price swings normalized once again, much wiser about the exacerbating effect of such volatility strategies.
Keith Parker, the chief US equity strategist at UBS, has a unique view on the debate. He argues the much-maligned volatility-targeting strategies fulfilled their role as ""natural rebalancing mechanisms,"" even though the resulting selling pressure was jarring. As an extension of that, he views the 10% correction as a healthy reset for the market, and he sees greener pastures ahead for stocks.
Parker forecasts that the benchmark S&P 500 will finish the year at 3,150, making him the most bullish strategist on Wall Street, according to a Bloomberg survey of 24 firms.
In an interview with Business Insider, Parker broke down the main catalysts for his bullish 2018 forecast, opined on President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs and the prospect of a trade war, outlined his biggest fear for the market, and broke down his sector picks.
This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Joe Ciolli: Your recent research suggests that you view the stock meltdown in early February as healthy for the overall market. Why is that?
Keith Parker: Getting these bouts of worry as fundamentals remain solid helps to lengthen the cycle for equities. We would still get later-cycle-type behavior from investors, but February is a reminder that a lot of volatility-targeting products are natural rebalancing mechanisms to keep the market from really moving into that overexuberant stage. They're keeping the market from a level that could spell a more menacing correction.
Ciolli: So the correction wasn't that big of a deal?
Parker: In terms of order of magnitude, 10% down in 10 days is extreme, historically speaking. You saw net US equity fund outflows of $43 billion, and a record unwind in futures and options, and we saw ETF short interest go up $30 billion. When you add that up, it's tremendous, and the order of magnitude was even bigger. But it wasn't as bad as it could've been.
Ciolli: On a broader basis, you're on the record as constructive on US equities. What's been helping the equity recovery, and what will drive stocks higher in the future?
Parker: There's pent-up demand on the M&A front, because deal activity fell off a bit going into the tax debate, around policy uncertainty. Now there's something like a $2 trillion annual pace for announced deals on US public targets — about 7% of total market cap — and that's just mind-boggling.
Meanwhile, buybacks are a form of return of cash flow of earnings. To the extent that we have earnings growth of 15%-plus this year, that should mean buybacks and corporate bid activities remain pretty solid.
Also, the ability of companies to bring back cash and profit that was previously trapped abroad is a big deal. When you take down the wall that is the US tax code for bringing back profits, that's an incremental positive to the return-of-capital story.
Ciolli: So which one is most likely to lead the charge higher?
Parker: We have five pillars: consumer, corporate spending, margin upside, corporate bid, and the ability for rates to normalize and equity multiples to sustain high levels. The biggest driver, given the market cap of tech and industrials, would be the corporate spending theme. Higher profit growth and weaker productivity — that really necessitates corporates having to spend to generate that incremental growth.
Ciolli: What's your take on the tariff/trade-war scenario? Is it truly a force to be reckoned with?
Parker: At first steel and aluminum tariffs were broad, and then there were some carve-outs for Mexico and Canada, which was a positive.
After steel and aluminum, the next incremental risk is around China action, following the intellectual-property investigation. We do see rising risk of trade actions. And when you have US imports of China products at $500 billion, the headline risk is considerable. That includes cellphones, computers, apparel, and other consumer goods.
The other risk is around retaliation. Those companies with high revenue exposure to China could be at risk, and the market typically discounts speculation like that before anything happens. I see multinationals at risk over the next few months.
Ciolli: What are your thoughts on the economic landscape? It seems like there have been some mixed signals lately.
Parker: With inflation, you're reaching a point in the cycle where it becomes more difficult to generate noninflationary growth.
In terms of the crosscurrents, there are two points. Number one, you're going from low inflation back towards target, which is possibly reflective of solid demand. Second, the wage inflation seen in early February really triggered part of the equity sell-off and rise in rates. When you have that risk, investors remain worried.
The fact that after-tax paychecks, given the tax cut for the consumer, are going up 2, 4%, should see consumption growth remain solid in the months going ahead. That should be an important offset.
Ciolli: Is there an economic sweet spot, and are we in it?
Parker: For markets, we are. The speed limit is such that people aren't going too fast, and traffic is reasonable. Accidents happen when people are driving too fast and there are lots of cars on the road. Later-cycle behavior tends to happen when you get things moving in a positive direction all at once — also known as overexuberance.
Ciolli: There's been speculation that hedges haven't been working as well lately, on a cross-asset basis. Do you buy that?
Parker: Typically, in the later cycle, when inflation and cash rates are rising, the correlation between bonds and equities turns less negative. That's because cash starts to become more attractive, so investors move out of those areas.
Inflation becomes a key driver of why some of those hedges — whether it's fixed-income, utilities, REITs, or staples — may be underperforming during a volatility spike. Those rate proxies don't work as well in a sell-off that's driven by inflation and rate worries.
Ciolli: So what can investors expect going forward?
Parker: When you have an environment where the correlation between bonds and equities makes it so there's no natural hedge, it moves portfolio-wide volatility up. Fed rate uncertainty also creates volatility that affects every asset class. The combination of that drives some portfolio de-risking, like we've been seeing.
Ciolli: Are there any sectors you favor? Ones you don't like?
Parker: We're long consumer discretionary over staples, on the view that this consumption boost from the tax plan will start taking effect, and lead to higher top-line growth over the coming months. Discretionary is relatively cheap versus the market, relative to history.
In terms of the corporate spending theme, we like tech and industrials over bond proxies like REITs and utilities. As rates move up, companies need to invest to make labor more productive.
As for our defensive preference, we like healthcare shares at this point in the cycle. We're still cautious on the yield proxies. We do like the banks within financials as rates move higher, and as the Fed's path of hikes gets a bit steeper.
Ciolli: What's your biggest fear for the market right now?
Parker: For better or worse, we're in a backdrop that's shifted to worrying about inflation and rates. In an environment where growth expectations are still solid, to the extent you have a weakening consumer that persists, that can keep markets afloat. Changing the narrative to higher rates, higher inflation, and weakening growth — that would be the biggest risk to the market. The consumer is key.
Ciolli: What's the best advice you can give to a young investor, or someone starting out in investment management?
Parker: Save when you're young. The benefits of annual compounding interest when you don't need the money now is tremendous.
Investing early, and investing in growth assets like equities, is recommended. Diversify exposure as well, possibly looking outside the US into something like emerging markets. Equity valuations aren't cheap, but over the long run you have corporate in a strong growth backdrop, and you have a government doing pro-business policies.
Stay with secular themes. Over the long run, certain sectors and industries have defensible business positions — in technology, healthcare, and industrials — will outperform during this.
For better or worse, we're all functions of our own experiences and biases. The younger millennial generation has witnessed a financial crisis, housing collapse, and stock market collapse — all very recently. There's temptation to believe that could continue happening again. It's getting over that inherent cognitive dissonance with investing that allows you to put money to work. And over the long run, it does pan out."

ANKARA/DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates NBD could agree to buy Turkey's  Denizbank  within weeks, sources said, after intense lobbying by the Turkish bank to convince President Tayyip Erdogan of the benefits of the potential $5.3 billion deal despite a diplomatic rift.
Dubai's biggest bank, Emirates NBD (DU:ENBD) said it was in preliminary talks to buy Denizbank (IS:DENIZ) from Russia's Sberbank (MM:SBER) in January, but the plan has met resistance from Erdogan, four sources told Reuters.
While Erdogan does not have direct control over Turkey's banks, the president could potentially block any deal by telling the country's BDDK banking watchdog not to approve it. 
Repeated efforts by Denizbank's chief executive to persuade Erdogan of the case for the takeover illustrate the president's important role in sealing major deals in Turkey.
Although it still requires approval, the deal is expected to be agreed in ""the next few weeks"", one of the sources said.
The BDDK did not respond to a request for comment.
Turkish relations with the Gulf states have been strained since Ankara stood by Qatar after the UAE, Saudi Arabia and others accused Doha of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies.
The United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, also regards Erdogan's AK Party as a friend of Islamist forces it opposes across the Arab world and last week the UAE's foreign minister said it faced challenges from Iran, Israel and Turkey.
And earlier this month the Arab world's largest private broadcaster stopped showing Turkish television programs.
""I'm not saying this deal will fall through, but it wouldn't be realistic to say these developments are supportive of the negotiations,"" one senior official in Ankara said.
Emirates NBD, Sberbank and Denizbank all declined to comment, as did Erdogan's office.
POSITIVE IMPACT
Denizbank Chief Executive Hakan Ates has met Erdogan and other senior officials in Ankara over the past month in an attempt to convince them that the deal would be positive for Turkey's banking system, several sources said. 
It was not clear how successful Ates, who declined to comment, had been, but one source said there was an acknowledgement in Ankara that Turkey's tensions were with Abu Dhabi, not Dubai - meaning with the UAE's policy makers, not the region's main commercial and financial hub. 
The cities are run by two close, but separate, families.
""There is a lot of scepticism about the Emiratis but investment is something else,"" said the source.
Denizbank is Turkey's ninth-largest lender by assets, making it a relatively small player in a fast-growing market. Sberbank, which is selling Denizbank as part of a broader regional strategy shift, paid around $3.5 billion for it in 2012. 
Shares in Denizbank have risen around 70 percent this year, helped by news of the talks, giving it a $5.3 billion market value.

Emirates NBD, which previously acquired BNP Paribas' Egyptian business, has been scouting for opportunities in the Turkish banking sector for several years as part of its international expansion.

1656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",PetroChina Pays Out Full Profit as Oil Rally Counters Writedowns,"(Bloomberg) -- PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest oil and gas company, once again rewarded shareholders by paying out its entire net income as dividends.
After a surprise payout from its half-year results in August, the Beijing-based company said Thursday it will send investors dividends that amount to slightly more than its 22.8 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in 2017 net income.
“Shareholders should be happy that PetroChina once again paid out all of its profit as dividend,” said Anna Yu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at ICBC International Research Ltd. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. holds almost 83 percent of the company.
PetroChina is recovering from its worst-ever performance the previous year as a rally in oil prices bolstered its exploration and production segment. Global benchmark Brent crude averaged 21 percent higher in 2017 than a year ago as OPEC and its allies cut output. And while the state-owned giant took a 23.9 billion yuan hit from reselling imported gas domestically below cost, those losses are seen having peaked.
As the country’s biggest natural gas producer and importer, PetroChina is key to President Xi Jinping’s campaign to replace coal with the cleaner-burning fuel. The nation’s gas use surged 15 percent last year, with imports satisfying around 40 percent of that demand, pushing up global prices this winter while leaving some parts of the country short of supply.
PetroChina will hand out dividends totaling 0.06074 yuan per share, including special payments. Given that free cash flow hit a record $24 billion, the dividend payout was “uninspiring,” Aditya Suresh, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in research note.
Profit in 2017, which almost tripled, compares with the 23.1 billion yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts and the company’s forecast of as much as 23.9 billion yuan in January.
Impairments more than doubled as the company wrote down the value of petrochemical and pipeline assets. Spending, which rose for the first time in five years, overshot its target by 13 percent.
“Profit could have been very impressive if not for the large asset writedowns,” said Laban Yu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies Group LLC. “Efficiency still looks to be an issue, as total production has fallen even as spending exceeded the budget it set at the beginning of last year.”

Steve Wynn sold 4.1 million shares of Wynn Resorts at $180 per share, the filing showed, which now makes him the third-biggest shareholder in the company, behind his former wife Elaine Wynn and The Vanguard Group Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Wynn Resorts' shares dipped 0.8 percent to $177.50 in trading ahead of the opening bell.
The casino mogul's share sale comes a week after Wynn Resorts said Steve and Elaine Wynn, who has a 9.26 percent stake, had scrapped a shareholder agreement that prevented them from selling their stakes.
Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of the Las Vegas-based company last month, following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. He has denied the accusations.
Analysts have said Wynn Resorts may become a takeover target following the departure of Steve Wynn, who was a strategic visionary and the chief diplomat for the company.

Elaine Wynn said in a regulatory filing earlier this week that she may hold talks with Wynn Resorts shareholders and management regarding the company's strategy, capital structure and allocation, and board composition, among others.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Bank creditors of detained Saudi Arabian tycoon, Maan al-Sanea, have asked his advisers for more details on a proposed settlement covering 16 billion riyals ($4.3 billion) in claims before they agree to move forward with the process, sources close to the matter said.
Banks met in Dubai on Wednesday as they seek to resolve the debt crisis that has rumbled on since al-Sanea's company Saad Group defaulted on its debt in 2009.
The meeting, the first major gathering of the debtors and creditors since 2009, took place as auctions were underway to sell around 900 vehicles owned by al-Sanea and Saad.
More than 30 banks, some of whom were represented by lawyers, attended the meeting, said one source close to the matter. Another said around 12 banks attended themselves included Emirates NBD, Dubai's largest bank, Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia's second largest bank by assets, and Germany's Portigon.
In a case separate from the dozens of Saudi businessmen and officials who were held up in a corruption crackdown, al-Sanea was detained by authorities late last year for unpaid debt.
Since then a tribunal in charge of resolving Saad's debt dispute appointed a consortium late last year to liquidate assets owned by the billionaire.
In an effort to halt that process and get al-Sanea released from detention, his family and their advisers are striving to reach a consensual settlement with bank creditors.
As well as properties and shares in companies including National Commercial Bank, Kingdom Holding, Samba Financial Group and Riyad Bank, proposed terms set out a framework for a deal that include “top-up assets” to be contributed by relatives of Maan al-Sanea.
In response to a request by Reemas, a financial consultancy advising al-Sanea, to form a steering committee to coordinate negotiations between lenders and al-Sanea and Saad, the banks asked for more details about the ""top-up assets"" before deciding on whether to move forward with a potential settlement, the sources said.
Reemas is expected to give banks details of those assets in the coming days, the sources said.
Banks, most of which have long written off the debt, have been told they would get better returns under the Reemas process than via the liquidation process, the sources said, who added that the process would also be faster.
They were also told there was potential for other banks to join the process once they have claims approved by the tribunal.

Conagra's shares were up 1.2 percent at $35.75 before the bell on Thursday.
The company's frozen foods business has been boosted by the acquisition of Sandwich Bros, which makes frozen breakfasts, and by refreshing brands such as Banquet's frozen meals to offer protein-rich products with fewer artificial ingredients.
Net sales in Conagra's frozen food business rose 3 percent to $689 million in the quarter. But, total sales inched up to $1.99 billion from $1.98 billion, due to declines in the Chicago, Illinois-based company's grocery and snacks business.
A near 6 percent drop in selling and general expenses and a $236.7 million benefit related to U.S. tax reforms helped the company's profit more than double.
Net income attributable rose to $362.8 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 25, from $179.7 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Conagra's profit of 61 cents per share topped analysts average estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company raised its full-year forecast for adjusted profit from continuing operations to $2.03 to $2.05 per share from $1.95 to $2.02.

Conagra had raised its profit forecast last month to account for a boost from the U.S. tax reforms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Thursday as President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports drove fears about the impact on the global economy, fueling the biggest percentage declines in Wall Street's three major indexes since they entered correction territory six weeks ago.
Trump signed a presidential memorandum that will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period. China will have space to respond, reducing the risk of immediate retaliation from Beijing.
But after equities recovered somewhat from earlier lows, selling pressure resumed on Wall Street heading into the close as investors fretted over the potential scale of U.S tariffs and possible impact on global trade.
""There’s too much negative sentiment right now,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""It's possible that it will be rough sledding for a while. I don’t see anything on the horizon that will reassure people that things are just great."" 
Major industrials slumped. Plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co lost 5.2 percent,  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) dropped 5.7 and 3M Co lost 4.7. The three were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P industrials sector plunged 3.28 percent. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 724.42 points, or 2.93 percent, to 23,957.89, the S&P 500 lost 68.24 points, or 2.52 percent, to 2,643.69, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 178.61 points, or 2.43 percent, to 7,166.68.
The losses marked the biggest daily percentage drop for each of the major indexes since Feb. 8, when the Dow and S&P confirmed a market correction from their Jan. 26 highs. 
Selling was broad, with only the defensive utilities 0.44on the plus side, up 0.44 percent, out of 11 major S&P sectors. 
The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&P 500, finished up 5.48 points at 23.34, its highest close since Feb. 13.23.34
U.S. treasury prices gained as investors sought out safe havens. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 23/32 in price to yield 2.8244 percent, from 2.907 percent late on Wednesday.
The drop in yields weighed on financial stocks, which were down 3.70 percent, making them the worst performing of the major sectors.
Another decline in shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), down 2.7 percent, continued to weigh on the broader market and the tech sector, the best performing S&P group for this year. The S&P technology index fell 2.69 percent on fears of greater regulation in the wake of the Facebook data leak.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he was open to additional government regulation and happy to testify before the U.S. Congress.
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) tumbled 12.8 percent after the drugmaker said it would not seek accelerated approval for its experimental lung cancer treatment based on results from a mid-stage study.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 59 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.77 billion shares, compared to the 7.17 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) came under further pressure from lawmakers, investors, advertisers and users on Thursday, the day after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted the social media network made mistakes in letting 50 million users' data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. 
U.S. lawmakers demanded Zuckerberg personally testify in Washington to explain his company's actions. 
Meanwhile, advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online, although it was hard to tell how many users are abandoning Facebook. 
In light of those concerns, investors continued to sell off Facebook shares, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. They closed on Thursday at $164.89, down 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 Index was down 2.5 percent on the day. Facebook shares closed at $185.09 on Friday. 
The company has lost more than $50 billion in market value since allegations this week that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election. 
Five days after the scandal broke, Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for mistakes his company made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.
On Thursday, Facebook executives were still saying sorry. 
""We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company, for the service we provide,"" Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview broadcast on CNBC. 
Zuckerberg's apology and promises were not enough to ease political pressure on the world's largest social media company.
""It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament,"" British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio. 
Zuckerberg's media rounds did little to satisfy Washington lawmakers in either political party who have demanded this week that the 33-year-old billionaire testify before Congress.
The Republican chairman and top Democrat of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said they will in coming days formally ask Zuckerberg to testify.
The request came a day after company executives briefed committee aides for nearly two hours and left with a list of at least 60 questions they were unable to answer, two aides said.
Zuckerberg said in media interviews on Thursday he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers. 
""My message to Mark Zuckerberg is you are right person. There's no question you are the right person,"" Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after Facebook executives briefed Senate staff on Thursday.
Facebook said it had no comment beyond what Zuckerberg had already said.
Executives also briefed another House committee on Thursday, and while they answered questions about Cambridge Analytica they were unprepared to address broader questions about Facebook's privacy policies, according to a staffer who was present.
REPUTATIONAL COSTS
Wall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs so far of a fundamental shift in the company's advertising-driven revenue model, but some said there would be costs to shore up its reputation. 
Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising. 
Sandberg said Facebook's priority was restoring users' trust, even if that meant accepting regulation of the data that is central to its ad business, and she said the company was ""massively ramping hiring."" 
Several analysts cut price targets. Technology stocks have fallen along with Facebook this week as investors worried about tighter scrutiny of global platforms like Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Snapchat. 
Analysts said Zuckerberg's promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers' ability to use Facebook data - the company's lifeblood.
Nevertheless, open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said it was ""pressing pause"" on its Facebook advertising after the revelations prompted it to take a closer look at the site's default privacy settings.
""We found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps,"" Mozilla said in a blog post.
British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of brands, threatened to withdraw ads if investigations show data has been misused.
""We think this issue is more likely to snowball than recede and that advertisers are reaching a tipping point at which spending on not only Facebook and other online platforms, is re-evaluated,"" brokerage Liberum said in a note.
But Sharon Rowlands, president of USA Today Network Marketing Solutions, said it was unlikely a flood of brands would stop advertising on Facebook because of its powerful targeting tools.

""The challenge is that the platform performs,"" Rowlands said.

The stock has lost around 9% so far this week, wiping around $60 billion off its market value, after investors learned data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica had collected and used without permission data from the accounts of millions of users.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday night for the Cambridge Analytica data controversy during an interview with CNN, and said he’d be willing to testify before Congress.
He added that his company made mistakes in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.



Many analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially eating into its clout with advertisers.
That has prompted a series of rare downgrades and cuts in price targets for Facebook shares, adding to signs that Wall Street analysts are waking up to the risks to the company.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) plans to add 80 jobs in Paris after Britain's exit from the European Union, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday, on top of around 200 the U.S. bank is set to transfer to its Frankfurt hub.
The potential transfer or creation of roles by the U.S. bank in France was first reported by French newspaper Les Echos, without giving a timeline for when they might be completed.
Morgan Stanley already employs around 120 bankers in Paris, and Reuters reported last July the bank has chosen Frankfurt to be its main base for its EU operations after Brexit. 
Its move to transfer some staff there follows a similar pattern to other banks which have picked one EU center to be their main regional subsidiary in the bloc, but then locating other parts of their businesses in several countries.
Swiss bank UBS earlier this month said it would pursue a decentralized approach, with staff mainly moving to Frankfurt and other locations where their clients are based.

U.S. and European banks are starting to execute contingency plans, after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.

(Reuters) - Consulting services firm Accenture Plc (N:ACN) trimmed its yearly forecast for profit margins, driving its stock down 6 percent on Thursday and overshadowing quarterly results that comfortably topped Wall Street targets.
Accenture now expects fiscal 2018 operating margin — profit as a proportion of revenue — of 14.8 percent, a level consistent with results in fiscal 2017, but lower than the 10- to 30-basis-point expansion originally expected by the company.
Dublin-based Accenture flagged lower profits from services for healthcare and public service clients as well as higher spending as reasons for the revised forecast.
The company also said it expects operating margin to expand in the second half of the year.
""Operating margin was light of (Wall Street) expectations ... operating profit in the Health & Public Service sector has declined significantly,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Chris Hickey said.
Accenture has spent more than $3 billion over the last three years — nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 — on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant (O:CTSH) and  IBM  (N:IBM).
Those services helped Accenture grow net revenue by 15.2 percent to $9.59 billion in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, the biggest increase in at least five years.
Net revenue also soared past analysts' average expectation of $9.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The digital and cloud services, which Accenture calls ""the New,"" also made up more than 55 percent of revenue, reaching a record level.
""'The New' is really impacting across the board,"" Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on a call with analysts.
Accenture began investing in businesses such as digital marketing and cybersecurity about five years ago, compared with its peers that began a similar effort only one or two years back, said Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Khatri.
The company forecast current-quarter revenue between $9.90 billion and $10.15 billion, well ahead of analysts' average estimate of $9.68 billion.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $863.7 million in the second quarter, from $838.8 million a year earlier. Accenture reported earnings of $1.37 per share in the latest quarter.
Results included a $137 million charge related to the new U.S. tax code.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.58 per share, topping market estimates of $1.49 per share.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",Justice Department urges judge to block AT&T-Time Warner merger,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration urged a federal judge on Thursday to block AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's proposed $85 billion merger with  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), saying the deal would hand the company a ""weapon"" to harm competition and raise consumer prices.
During opening statements in one of the most closely watched U.S. antitrust trials in years, Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the deal would hike prices by more than $400 million annually, or an average of $0.45 a month for pay TV subscribers.
Conrath said AT&T would be able to use content from movie and TV show maker Time Warner including its Turner unit to prevent innovation. The merger will hurt 90 million U.S. pay TV subscribers, Conrath added.
""This is a weapon to harm competition,"" Conrath told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who will decide the case.
The Justice Department filed suit in November to stop AT&T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the deal. AT&T says a merger would benefit consumers by creating efficiencies. AT&T is the biggest pay-TV provider via subsidiary DirecTV.
Opening statements were delayed one day by bad weather in Washington. 
Conrath suggested that AT&T would be able to hike fees that Turner charges for its content by about 10 percent if the merger were approved and that the company could withhold content from rival distributors. He referenced an internal email from Turner executives that Dish Network Corp's Sling service would be ""crap"" without Turner content, as he paraphrased the stronger language in the email.
Trump publicly criticized the deal as a candidate and as president, and the Republican president often has excoriated Time Warner's CNN news network.
If the administration loses, that could open up the field for similar tie-ups between distributors and content providers. But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers. 
AT&T and Time Warner are not direct competitors, making the deal a so-called vertical merger between companies on the same supply chain. The vast majority of challenged mergers involve one rival buying another.
The merger would hand AT&T, if it becomes the new owner of Time Warner, the motive and opportunity to refuse to license March Madness NCAA basketball tournament games, along with premium cable channel HBO and other content, to pay-TV rivals and online distributors, the Justice Department has said. 
AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli had asked for access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the deal, but the judge denied the request.
If the government loses,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) could strike deals to buy movie or television makers and squeeze smaller pay-TV providers.
AT&T has said the merger would result in more than $2.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2020. It argues that the deal is crucial to compete with companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The internet companies pose two challenges to pay TV. They either compete with cable and satellite television for ad dollars or provide cheaper online video that has hurt pricey pay-TV. Some do both.

""There has been a very euphoric start to the year,"" Ermotti said at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Financials Conference in London. ""The rest, as I said before, is more of the same as we have seen in the last few years.""
He declined to give any further guidance about the Swiss bank's first-quarter business.
After uncharacteristically steady markets in 2017 which continued with buoyant growth in January, a market downturn --presaged by sharp equity declines in February -- was bound to come, the head of Switzerland's biggest bank said.
""We are at the end of a long run of a bull market and economic expansion, which may still be there for awhile. But it's not reasonable to expect that this is going to go on forever,"" Ermotti said.
""We are very geared towards equities as a business, and in our wealth management businesses there is a correlation between how financial markets and equity markets go with our profitability.""
However, changing dynamics could boost the bank's investment banking activities and help offset any impact to wealth management, he added.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Wednesday cautioned over a 450 million euro first-quarter impact from a strong euro and higher funding costs, while the CEO of Swiss rival  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) said the bank was seeing a ""very confused"" quarter.

In an opinion piece on French website Numerama, Bruno Le Maire wrote that he had asked former central bank official Jean-Pierre Landau to draft a proposal for a legislative framework for digital currencies. 
""France has every interest in becoming the first major financial center to propose an ad-hoc legislative framework for companies making an Initial Coin Offering,"" Le Maire wrote.
An ICO involves a company raising funds by offering investors tokens in return for their cash or cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, as opposed to obtaining shares in the company from a traditional offering.
Le Maire said that an action plan to be presented to the French government in a few weeks will propose giving French market regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) the option to authorize companies to issue ""tokens"" to raise funds, as long as they respect certain criteria to protect investors. 
""This 'white list' will provide a precious reference for investors who want to finance serious projects,"" he wrote. 
Le Maire said that blockchain will offer unprecedented opportunities for French startups to raise funds by issuing tokens in Initial Coin Offerings. 
""This promises to create a network of confidence without intermediaries, offers increased traceability and will boost economic efficiency,"" Le Maire wrote. 
Le Maire said France has a tradition of financial innovation and had created a legal framework for crowdfunding in 2014, had become a leader in green finance and had legalized the use of blockchain for the transfer of securities in December last year. 
""Our target is simple: enter into the world of finance of the 21st century by guaranteeing all players the necessary security for their development ... we should not miss out on the blockchain revolution,"" Le Maire wrote. 

Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 20 largest economies meeting in Buenos Aires this week asked regulators to monitor cryptocurrencies but stopped short of proposing any specific action.

The company, which just started producing branded content last year, said it has signed several seven-figure deals. 
It has also signed deals with brands including Procter & Gamble Co and Samsung (KS:005930). Terms of those deals were not disclosed. The company declined to provide revenue numbers.
""We have shown that not only can we get global athletes but we can tell their stories,"" said Levick, the former chief revenue officer of Spotify who joined Players' Tribune last year as its first CEO. 
Players' Tribune in April will open offices in Barcelona and London and will launch in Europe this spring to coincide the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Given the popularity of athletes, particularly soccer players in Europe, expanding abroad makes sense, Levick said.
Unlike the U.S. site which has primarily focused on text, the European site will feature more video, Levick said.
Players' Tribune is working with Spanish soccer player Gerard Pique and his investment group Kosmos, to grow the business in Europe and bring athletes' stories to the platform, Pique said.
Players' Tribune is also doing shows, including a talk show that will be hosted by Pique.
Jeter started Players' Tribune to allow his fellow athletes to tell their stories. For example, last year, National Basketball Association point guard Isaiah Thomas wrote a first-person essay about the difficulties he experienced when the Boston Celtics traded him to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers later traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers.
Players' Tribune is expanding into Europe and looking to grow revenue at a time when more advertisers are looking for ""brand safe"" environments where their messages will not be in danger of being juxtaposed to untoward content nearby, Levick said.
Players' Tribune has about 3 million unique users a month, a fraction of those at sports sites like ESPN, which averages 85-95 million unique visitors per month.
But the audience is engaged, Levick said. Players' Tribune averages 150 million content views a month and a viewer spends on average eight minutes on the site.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","China's banks eye capital raising, earnings lift as they shed bad loans","By Shu Zhang and Engen Tham
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese banks are set to quicken the pace of bad loan disposals this year, likely raising more capital and taking advantage of relaxed provisioning rules as they look to lift what is expected to be a modest year of earnings growth in 2017.
Among those due to report annual earnings next week are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (SS:601939) (HK:0939), Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) (SS:601288) (HK:1288), and Bank of China (BoC) (SS:601988) (HK:3988). 
Annual profits for the 12-months to Dec. 31 are expected to have risen between 2.4 percent to 4.9 percent for China's biggest four banks, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, helped by steadying interest margins. In 2016, net profit at four of China's top five banks grew by less than two percent. 
A broad crackdown on financial risks, including past policy tightening, and a nationwide deleveraging campaign have prompted many banks to focus on improving asset quality. And as the cost of funds ease, the outlook for banks appears more promising. 
""In general profit growth for the banking sector in 2017 was modest, but the pace of growth is expected to accelerate on falling cost of loans and widening interest margins,"" said Jaclyn Wang, an analyst with BOCOM International. 
China's total new loans hit a record 13.53 trillion yuan ($2.14 trillion) in 2017, and expectations are for another solid year of lending growth despite a slight slowdown forecast for the economy. The credit boom has been fueled by strong economic growth, while a clampdown on riskier shadow lending has forced banks to shift some loans back onto their balance sheets. 
Net interest margins (NIM) already appear ""to be bottoming out for large banks"" Nomura analysts said in a recent note, forecasting NIM to expand by 5 basis points year-on-year to 2.18 percent in 2018, contributing to 9 percent growth in pre-provision operating profit. 
Beijing's drive to boost domestic consumption is seen keeping household loan demand strong. Commercial banks' non-performing loan ratio has steadied to 1.74 percent by end-2017, from around 1.76 percent in the third quarter of 2016. 
CAPITAL RAISING 
Capital raising and the continued clean-up of bad loans will be a key focus for investors. 
Many of the banks will need the fresh capital to keep their capital buffers within regulatory limits as they bring off-balance sheet lending onto their books, as part of Beijing's extended crackdown on financial risks and shadow banking activity. 
So far this year mainland listed Chinese banks have announced around 400 billion yuan ($63.34 billion) worth of private and public fundraising plans, according to Reuters analysis of company filings. 
Fourteen banks - mostly city and rural commercial banks - are queuing for initial public offerings in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, a Reuters analysis of regulatory disclosure shows. 
AgBank, the country's third largest lender, kicked off banks' recapitalization this year by announcing a 100 billion yuan fundraising plan - the largest A-share private placement by a Chinese bank. 
While AgBank's capital cushion lagged that of its Big Four rivals, all currently hold capital that exceeds the regulatory minimum levels. 
One factor likely to ease pressure on banks is the recent relaxation of bad-loan buffer rules. 
Earlier this month, regulators cut the reserves commercial banks must hold against bad loans from 150 percent to as low as 120 percent - the exact rate will be partly dependent on how quickly banks shed their bad loans. 
Soured debt in the commercial banking sector totaled 1.7 trillion yuan ($268.5 billion) by end-2017, the highest in 12 years, official data show. 
Should provisions be cut to 120 percent, banks' collective net profit could increase by 1 trillion yuan, or 57 percent from 2017 levels, according to estimates by analysts at Guotai Junan Securities. ""Loan re-pricing and stabilized impairment charges will help ease pressure on profitability for big banks this year,"" said Yulia Wan, an analyst at Moody's.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings lost almost $20 billion from its market value on Thursday after the Chinese internet giant missed quarterly revenue estimates and warned that planned investments may hurt margins.
By noon Tencent shares were down 3.29 percent against a 0.63 percent dip in the benchmark Hang Seng Index, wiping $18.4 billion off the company's market capitalization. They had dropped as much as 4.6 percent earlier in the morning.
Tencent posted a 98 percent jump in quarterly net profit on Wednesday, beating estimates, though revenue grew slower than expected at 51 percent.
With a market capitalization of about $542 billion, Tencent is Asia's most-valuable listed company and the world's No.5 behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Company President Martin Lau warned at a briefing on Wednesday that the company plans to invest ""aggressively"" in areas including video and payment, which may hurt margins.
Tencent's gaming revenue in the last quarter was disappointing, as average revenue per user declined quarter-on-quarter, Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said. 
But she said the outstanding performance of Tencent's new mobile games this year boded well for growth, and that rapid adoption of WeChat in-app services may lead to more monetization potential. 
""We expect FY18 to be another year of investment but view it necessary to further expand its market leadership in video and offline payment,"" she said in a note accompanying a target price raise by 1 percent to HK$530.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 01:57AM ET</span>",Best Buy cuts ties with China's Huawei: source,"By Nandita Bose and Sijia Jiang
LAS VEGAS/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY), the largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer, will cut ties with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a person familiar with the matter said, amid heightened scrutiny on Chinese tech firms in the United States.
Best Buy will stop selling Huawei's devices over the next few weeks, according to the person with knowledge of the matter, a setback for the Chinese telecommunications giant as it looks to expand in the U.S. market.
The move, after similar actions from U.S. carriers including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), comes as U.S. scrutiny of Chinese tech firms grows amid simmering tensions over U.S.-China trade and concerns of security.
A Best Buy spokesman told Reuters the firm could not comment on specific contracts with vendors. ""We make decisions to change what we sell for a variety of reasons,"" he said.
Huawei said in emailed comments on Thursday that it valued its relationship with Best Buy but could not discuss details of its partnership with the U.S. firm.
""Huawei currently sells its products through a range of leading consumer electronics retailers in the U.S.,"" the firm said, adding its products met the ""highest security, privacy and engineering standards in the industry"".
Earlier this year, AT&T was forced to scrap a plan to offer Huawei handsets after some members of Congress lobbied against the idea with federal regulators, sources told Reuters.  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) also ended its plans to sell Huawei phones last year, according to media reports.
Last month two Republican Senators introduced legislation that would block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from Huawei or Chinese peer ZTE Corp, citing concern the firms would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.
The tougher climate in the United States has forced Huawei to sell its flagship smartphone Mate 10 Pro - its challenger to the iPhone - in the United States only through open channels.

U.S tech and electronics website CNET.com first reported the termination of the agreement on Wednesday.
