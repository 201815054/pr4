SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) said on Monday its CEO will take about two months leave around the scheduled release of a major report into the country's finance sector, prompting a rebuke from a shareholder group.
A spokesman for Australia's fourth-largest lender said its CEO Andrew Thorburn would take a holiday after its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, where investors are likely to cast a protest vote against the pay packages of its top executives.
Thorburn would ""return to work for the release of the Royal Commission's final report, and to consider and lead NAB's response,"" a spokesman said in an email.
""He will then take a month's long service leave to refresh, recharge and spend time with his family before returning to lead NAB through the next stage of our transformation.""
Billions of dollars have been wiped off the value of NAB and its three larger rivals this year as the Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector exposed a greed-driven culture in which staff were incentivized to mislead customers. 
The inquiry is due to release its final report by Feb. 1, 2019. Analysts expect the report will recommend substantial structural and regulatory changes in the banking, financial advice and fund management sectors. The lawyers running the inquiry have said they may recommend referring some cases to criminal prosecutors. 
The CEOs of NAB's three larger rivals - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) - will take about three weeks off from next week and return to work in mid-January, as is common practice in Australia. NAB Chief Financial Officer Gary Lennon will act as CEO in Thorburn's absence. 
Thorburn's holiday is scheduled to start after NAB's annual shareholders' meeting where investors are expected to vote down the bank's executive pay plans, reflecting widespread anger against the sector as a result of the inquiry. ""It's hard to think that investors could be more disappointed than they already are, but this probably won't be helpful,"" Dennis Shore, a representative of the Australian Shareholders' Association, referring to Thorburn's long holiday. 

""There's a lot of work to be done so this does seems unusual, but on the other hand you can see the need for the leader of the bank to be in good shape to tackle the task ahead over the next year or two.""

On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 500 points to close at its lowest level since early May. The S&P 500 fell 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite pulled back 2.26%. Weaker-than-expected economic data out of China were said to be catalysts for the selling.
Retail sales grew 8.1% year on year, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, compared with the median forecast of 8.8%. The growth was the weakest pace since 2003, according to Reuters’ records.
Meanwhile, growth in industrial output also dipped half a percentage point to notch a year-on-year rise of 5.4%, lower than the 5.9% that markets projected.
On the other hand, fixed-asset investment grew 5.9% from January to November, marginally higher than the previous expected 5.8%.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%, but the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.6% by 9:34 PM ET (02:34 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed at 26,090.0.
The People’s Bank of China said in a statement on Monday that anti-globalisation and trade protectionism created more uncertainties and challenges for China’s economy, but the central bank will “guide reasonable growth of credit and social financing.”

4,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2018 08:16PM ET</span>",Japanese electronics firms look to re-engineer their design mojo,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Akihiro Adachi, a 31-year-old audiovisual equipment designer at Panasonic Corp, longed for some personal space during his lengthy train rides from Osaka to Tokyo. So when his company set out to encourage innovation, he joined with some colleagues and came up with ""Wear Space,"" a headset that limits noise and peripheral vision.
Many at Panasonic were puzzled.
""Someone said the office full of people wearing this would look weird,"" said Kang Hwayoung, another member of the 10-person design team. 
But the prototype unexpectedly won a global design award and received positive feedback from unexpected quarters, such as sake tasters who wanted to limit sensory input. 
The project is among a range of efforts in the Japanese electronics industry to reinvigorate industrial design. After years of losing ground to design-first rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Dyson, Japanese companies are now trying to recover the processes and creative flair that produced iconic products such as the Walkman.
Panasonic, Sony and Mitsubishi Electric are among those implementing practices that have been routine at many U.S. and European companies, such as engaging designers at every step and treating packaging as part of the product.
""We used to have designers involved only in final stages of our product development process, just for an aesthetic fix,"" Yoshiyuki Miyabe, Panasonic's technology and manufacturing chief, told reporters. ""We are revamping the process so that designers can join us from the planning phase.""
The Japanese government is promoting the efforts: a report in May urged corporate executives to pursue ""design-driven management, whereby a company leverages design as a primary driver of competitiveness.""
It also called for tax incentives for design-related investments and new laws to better protect intellectual property. The government is set to revise such laws next year. 
""Of course, we had an argument over how much the government can do and should do with private-sector issues like this,"" said Daisuke Kubota, director at the government's design registration system planning office, who was involved in the panel. 
""But a lot of design experts asked us for government initiatives, saying that this is really the last chance and Japan would never be able to catch up with global rivals if this opportunity is missed.""
Another member of the panel, Kinya Tagawa, visiting professor at the Royal College of Art and co-founder of design firm Takram, says there has been a sharp increase in major companies' requesting design lectures for their executives. 
""I'm seeing a sign of change,"" he said. 
THE ROAD AHEAD
All agree there is a long way to go. C-suite designers remain a rarity at most electronics companies while technologists reign supreme, company officials and industrial designers say.
Japan last year received 31,961 applications for design registrations, only a fraction of China's 628,658 and half of South Korea's 67,374. In the heyday of the Japanese electronics industry in the early 1980s, Japan had nearly 60,000 applications every year.
Tagawa said the root of today's problems was the failure of Japanese firms to absorb lessons from the software revolution, which showed the importance of user-centered design principles and easy-to-use products such as Apple's iPhone. Instead, they remained fixated on engineering. 
Ryuichi Oya, who retired as design chief of Sharp Corp last month, says he saw that attitude up close when he moved to Sharp four years ago after a long stint at automaker Mazda Motor. 
""Designers at home electronics companies have little say compared to engineers,"" he said. ""When engineers dismiss design proposals as too costly or difficult from an engineering point of view, designers easily succumb.""
Oya said he found it particularly hard to convince management of the need for a design vision.
""It's not about whether you like this color or that shape,"" he said. ""There have to be design principles unique to Sharp and consistent across its product line.""
COMPETITION
Japanese designers cite the contrast with South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) Group, where its patriarch, Lee Kun-hee, said in 1996 that design was a core management resource ""imperative for a company's survival in the 21st century."" He sharply boosted both the number and status of designers. 
At Sony, insiders say design began its return to the forefront after chairman Kaz Hirai took over in 2012. Change has been slow as the company went through a painful restructuring, but the results can be seen its approach to the revival of Aibo, a robot dog.
Designers worked to craft a holistic user experience, starting from the moment a customer opened the box, tapping into a community of Aibo owners, Sony design chief Yutaka Hasegawa said. 
""We had intense discussions over how Aibo should be packaged, to make it look closer to a living creature. It's important because opening the container box marks the customer's first encounter with the dog."" 
They decided to lay Aibo sideways with its head tilting to the left, a more expensive option than placing it face down because the interior packaging must be asymmetrical.
The result was a buzz among Aibo owners, with some posting on the Internet videos showing a ""ceremony for opening the Aibo container.""

5,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",EQT's board to seek talks with Rice brothers: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and David French
(Reuters) - EQT Corp's board of directors will ask to meet Toby and Derek Rice for talks, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday, after the two brothers threatened the largest producer of natural gas in the United States with a board challenge.
The Rice family sold its company Rice Energy Inc to EQT for $6.7 billion in cash and stock last year. It now owns about 2.75 percent of EQT, and Toby and Derek Rice wrote a letter last week to EQT's board asking for a ""course correction"". 
The brothers have also warned EQT that they will nominate their own directors to its board at its next annual shareholder meeting in 2019 if a ""mutually agreeable outcome"" is not reached.
EQT Chairman Jim Rohr and Chief Executive Rob McNally plan to write to the Rice brothers to ask them to discuss their plans for the company in more detail with the board, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
EQT declined to comment, while a spokesman for the Rice brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Rice brothers said in their letter last week that they had previously engaged in private discussions with Rohr and McNally to discuss their proposals, which included ""inserting Toby Rice into the organization with proper authority and support to oversee operations.""
They said they were going public with their demands because of what they called EQT's lack of reciprocal engagement, as well as its pushing forward with establishing its 2019 operational plan.
It is not clear how the Rice brothers will respond to EQT's offer, and what outcome any new talks may produce.
EQT shares have lost more than 45 percent of their value since the company's acquisition of Rice Energy in November 2017, much worse than the 8 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Energy index in the same period.
The Rice brothers have said they have a ""proven, detailed business plan"" to generate an incremental $400 million to $600 million of pre-tax free cash flow per year above EQT's current plans, resulting in more than $1 billion of free cash flow annually.

EQT, which has a market capitalization of $4.9 billion, is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin. It has operations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.

Thierry Bollore, the French group's deputy CEO, issued the demand in a Dec. 14 letter to Nissan, the source said on Sunday, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
""We respectfully ask that the board consider calling an extraordinary general meeting of Nissan shareholders as promptly as practicable,"" Bollore wrote in the letter.
A Renault spokesman declined to comment.
Ghosn's arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken Renault's control.
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding.
The call for a shareholder meeting will likely be seen as an attempted show of force by Renault's interim management, led by Bollore and Mouna Sepehri, Ghosn's long-standing chief of staff who also heads legal affairs and communications.
The letter made no mention of using the shareholder meeting to hire or fire Nissan board members but remained vague about its purpose, saying only that it would ""allow for appropriate disclosure and discussion of governance and other matters"".
It added that the indictment of Nissan ""creates significant risks to Renault, as Nissan's largest shareholder, and to the stability of our industrial alliance"".
At a Dec. 13 Renault board meeting, directors were briefed on the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn's arrest. He was charged alongside Nissan this week over the company's failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive. He and alleged accomplice Greg Kelly remain in custody.
While Nissan ousted Ghosn days after his arrest, the Renault board reiterated its earlier decision to keep him in office. Directors have yet to be given access to the Nissan findings, which are being closely held by Renault lawyers.
Bollore's demand for a Nissan shareholder meeting was a ""management decision"" that was not raised at the previous day's board session, the company source said, adding that it had been discussed subsequently with ""all of the directors"".
Senior director Philippe Lagayette is standing in as chairman. The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, is backing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard to replace Ghosn permanently as chairman, Le Figaro reported.

The call, led by the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF) and the Church Commissioners of England (CCE), comes in the wake of shareholder moves at other major energy firms seeking to make them more responsive to climate change and its impact on the business.
The statement released on Sunday by the CCE asked Exxon to disclose, for the first time, short, medium and long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both its operations and the use of its products.
""We want to see ExxonMobil develop a clear strategy for long-term sustainability, in line with international commitments for a safer climate,"" Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the CCE, said in the statement.
Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, added: ""The world is transitioning to a lower carbon future and Exxon needs to demonstrate its ability to adapt or risk its bottom line along with investors' confidence.""
Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pair have previously teamed up to pressure Exxon on environmental issues, including on a shareholder resolution in 2017 which asked the company to disclose the impact of measures to combat climate change on its business.
The NYSCRF and CCE are joined in the latest initiative, which will be filed for a potential vote at Exxon's shareholder meeting in the spring of 2019, by other funds including the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), and HSBC Global Asset Management, the statement added.
Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) set out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets that were linked to executive pay in 2020, following pressure from its investors.
 BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) have also set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but these are limited to their own operations.

The government is the carmaker's biggest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake and two board seats.
""He ticks all the boxes. He is available, he is an industry person, an expert in the sector, he is highly regarded by the government, and he has an international stature,"" Le Figaro quoted one of the sources as saying of Senard.
A Renault spokesman declined to comment. Officials at Michelin were not immediately available.
Reuters reported exclusively on Dec. 14 that the French government was seeking candidates to replace Ghosn.
Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 and has been formally charged with understating his compensation by about half of the 10 billion yen ($88 million) he was awarded over five years from 2010 as chairman of Japan's Nissan (T:7201).
While Renault has until now kept Ghosn as CEO, Nissan ousted him on Nov. 22. 
Nissan is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding alliance with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy minister said he believed the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline can go ahead while preserving Ukraine's vital interests, but that Berlin is also in talks to diversify its energy supply with liquefied natural gas.
U.S. President Donald Trump in July accused Germany of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion, Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is to be built in the Baltic Sea. 
Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route from next year.
Washington is concerned the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenues and says Moscow is using the project to divide Europe.
""Personally, I believe that this project can be justified if Ukraine's vital interests are preserved at the same time,"" German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters in an interview conducted on Friday for publication on Sunday.
""And one of these vital interests is that even after 2019, substantial gas transit through Ukraine will take place from Russia. There are discussions about this at the moment,"" he said, adding that the detail of the talks was ""very difficult"".
Ukraine derives up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) from transit charges.
""We will not reduce dependence on Russia by torpedoing a pipeline such as Nord Stream 2 and then sourcing gas from Russia from other pipelines,"" Altmaier said.
""Greater independence is only conceivable if, in addition to the long-term supply of gas, we also create an LNG infrastructure in Germany.""
Washington has touted liquefied natural gas (LNG), delivered by U.S. companies, as an alternative to Russian gas.
Altmaier said German government members were agreed they wanted to build the infrastructure to import LNG soon, and ""we are currently in the process of clarifying the location issue with private investors.""
Turning to Britain's departure from the European Union, Altmaier said an EU summit last week showed a deal on Britain's withdrawal from the bloc could not be renegotiated but ""on the other hand, that the European Union is ready to provide clarification"".
""Between these two poles ... there is a certain amount of tension that can only be overcome by Britain putting proposals on the table that, as far as I can see, are not yet available,"" he added.
On German domestic politics, he said Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was not divided following a robust leadership contest this month.

""It is now clear that we have a stable government with a chancellor for the next few years,"" he added.

Unlike power prices, which typically move once a year, gas prices move every month in France and are set using a formula that takes into account production costs. 
Many French governments have postponed tariff increases to protect consumers and their own approval ratings in the past, but legally the government has no authority to set prices.
Earlier this month, the government suspended increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent public protests against President Emmanuel Macron's policies and said it would keep gas and power prices unchanged this winter.
The environment ministry said on Sunday it wanted to ensure Engie's gas prices do not change until June 2019 but gave no explanation on the new timeframe of the requested price freeze.
Officials at the environment ministry were not immediately available to comment.
""Engie has taken notice of the government's request and will realize the necessary operations in order to guarantee the stability of the regulated tariffs of natural gas until the end of June,"" Engie said in an emailed statement.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) on Friday named the Time's Up anti-sexual harassment group and 17 other organizations that will share a $20 million donation stemming from the exit of its chief executive Les Moonves following allegations of sexual misconduct.
Time's Up and the body representing Hollywood producers swiftly announced that they will spend their share of the funds on programs to increase diversity in the entertainment industry, and provide anti-sexual harassment training.
CBS said in a statement that the $20 million grant was part of the company's separation agreement with Moonves and ""was deducted from any severance benefits that may be due to him.""
Moonves, a major figure at the CBS broadcast network for more than two decades, was forced out in September after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.
Moonves has acknowledged three of the encounters but said they were consensual, and denied others. He was the most powerful U.S. figure to have been brought down in the #MeToo scandal that has roiled Hollywood, politics and boardrooms since October 2017.
The organizations receiving the CBS funds, including the #MeToo social media movement and the anti-sexual violence group RAINN, said the money would ""drive real progress"" in ending sexual harassment.
But they added in a joint statement: ""We also recognize that these funds are not a panacea, nor do they erase or absolve decades of bad behavior.""
The entertainment unit of Time's Up said it would use its $500,000 grant on a mentoring program aimed at increasing the numbers of women and people of color rising through the producer and executive ranks of the entertainment industry. The program will also offer financial support to low-paid juniors and assistants.
""There is nothing short of an urgent need to have the people who buy, create and promote entertainment content be more representative of the people we serve,"" film producer Jenno Topping said in a statement.
The Producers Guild of America Foundation said it would use its $2 million grant from CBS to provide free anti-sexual harassment training and legal consultation on smaller, independent film and television sets.
RAINN, which also received $2 million, said it will support its national sexual assault hotline, which has seen a huge surge in calls.
RAINN said that by the end of December, more than 270,000 people will have received help from RAINN’s victim services programs in 2018, up more than 60,000 from the prior year.

The decision follows years of mounting concern at the risk posed to the German economy by cash-rich Chinese investors buying stakes in strategically important companies, gaining access to valuable know-how and inside knowledge.
The takeover of robotics firm Kuka by China's Midea in 2016 spooked Germany, as did the surprise purchase earlier this year of a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler by Chinese carmaker Geely [GEELY.UL].
Ministers agreed the trigger threshold for probes of stakes in companies in areas relevant to national security should be cut from the current 25 percent, Handelsblatt said, citing the draft legislation, which it had seen.
In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said rule changes were due.
The move comes amid mounting Western concern at the security implications of investments by an increasingly assertive China.

The United States has been urging European countries not to buy advanced telecommunications infrastructure from China's Huawei, for fear it could plant technology accessible to the Chinese state. Huawei has denied it would ever do this.

ZHOUSHAN, China (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) opened its first 737 completion plant in China on Saturday, a strategic investment aimed at building a sales lead over arch-rival Airbus (PA:AIR) in one of the world's top travel markets that has been overshadowed by the U.S-China trade war.
The world's largest planemaker also delivered the first of its top-selling 737s completed at the facility in Zhoushan, about 290 km (180 miles) southeast of Shanghai, to state carrier  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) during a ceremony on Saturday with top executives from both companies.
The executives, alongside representatives from China's state planner and aviation regulator, unveiled the plane at an event attended by hundreds of people.
Boeing and Airbus have been expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the fast-growing aviation market, which is expected to overtake the United States as the world's largest in the next decade. 
Boeing invested $33 million last year to take a majority stake in a joint venture with state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) to build the completion center, which installs interiors and paints liveries. 
Chicago-based Boeing calls itself the top U.S. exporter and delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, where it forecasts demand for 7,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years valued at $1.2 trillion.
However, the plant's inaugural ceremony was overshadowed by tensions between the United States and China as they engage in a bruising tit-for-tat tariff war. The world's two largest economies are in a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. 
""Am I nervous about the situation? Yeah, of course. It's a challenging environment,"" John Bruns, President of Boeing China, told reporters on a conference call earlier on Saturday.
""We have to keep our eye on the long game in China. Long term, I'm optimistic we will work our way through this,"" he said.
While the trade frictions have hurt businesses such as U.S. soy bean farmers and Chinese manufacturers, their impact on Boeing has been unclear. U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs.
Bruns said he remained optimistic about the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China and described aviation as a ""bright spot"" amid tensions between the two countries. 
Asked about the possibility of technology transfer agreements between Boeing and COMAC, Bruns stressed that the purpose of the plant was for installing seats, painting vehicles, and completing the planes' final delivery. 
""That's only a part of what we do in the production of airplanes,"" he said.
Officials and executives made no direct reference to the trade tensions in public remarks at the planemaker's Zhoushan facility.
Boeing aims eventually to hit a delivery target of 100 planes a year at Zhoushan, although Bruns deflected a question on how quickly it would reach that level and said Boeing had no plans to expand work to other aircraft types.

Boeing also hopes the plant will relieve pressure at the Seattle-area facility where it plans to boost production next year of its best-selling 737 narrowbody aircraft but has struggled with production delays.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico aims to lift oil and gas production by almost 50 percent in the next six years and in January will award infrastructure and drilling contracts to develop 20 fields, state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos said on Saturday.
Octavio Romero, chief executive officer of the company generally known as Pemex, said the new government would increase exploration investment by around 10 percent annually to reverse dwindling output as he presented a new plan for the industry.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, wants to revive Pemex, which has become heavily indebted as crude output fell from a peak of nearly 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004 to less than 1.8 million in October.
""It's a new Pemex rescue,"" Lopez Obrador said alongside Romero in the port of Ciudad del Carmen in the southern Gulf of Mexico shortly before his government was due to present its first budget with Pemex's finances under close scrutiny.
Under the plan, Mexican crude output is due to climb to some 2.624 million barrels bpd by the end of 2024, while gas production will also rise by about 50 percent.
Output will stabilize in the coming months and start to pick up toward the end of next year, the Pemex CEO said. However, projections presented in the government's first budget later on Saturday suggested output would continue falling until 2020. 
Mexico's previous government sought to increase production by opening up production and exploration to private capital. But the decline has yet to bottom out.
Lopez Obrador, an admirer of Lazaro Cardenas, the president who nationalized Mexico's oil industry 80 years ago, was opposed to the 2013-14 constitutional overhaul of the industry carried out by his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto.
The veteran leftist says he will respect 110 private oil contracts awarded under Pena Nieto, but this month challenged oil majors to start pumping oil quickly, offering them a three-year ""truce,"" without giving further details.
In the meantime, Mexico will speed up exploitation of 20 mostly offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Romero said.
To this end, contracts for the necessary infrastructure will be awarded on Jan. 15 and to drill wells on Jan. 31, he added.
Most of the fields are offshore and the government plans to issue ""integrated"" infrastructure contracts, Romero said. The drilling of the wells would be ""turnkey"" contracts that made the companies or consortiums responsible for delivery.
Pemex will be responsible for the engineering and supervision of the services. By December 2019, the 20 fields should yield 73,000 bpd of output, Romero said.
Energy Secretary Rocio Nahle told reporters in the city that priority would be given to Mexican firms in the contracting process, based on a restricted list of invitees.

Romero said nine companies had expressed interest in drilling the offshore wells, and five others had done so for the four onshore fields. All are majority Mexican-owned, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are eager for a touch of Christmas cheer from the U.S. Federal Reserve next week, hoping for signs the central bank may ease up on interest rate hikes next year and spark a Santa Claus rally.
U.S. stocks are having their worst December performance in 16 years with the S&P 500 (SPX) notching a 5 percent drop so far this month. The Fed's ongoing reversal of easy-money policy is a major overhang, and it is expected to raise rates more at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
That would mark a fourth consecutive December increase since 2015 when it started gradually lifting them. The question on investors' minds is whether it could be the last.
""It's imperative (the Fed releases) a dovish statement and an accommodative Q&A session,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""If not, that would put stocks at risk again.""
""The Fed's the key to a strong December, and it's getting late in the year.""
Recent comments from policymakers have fueled expectations for a timeout signal when the rate-setting committee's statement is released along with officials' individual projections for how much further they will rise in 2019 and beyond.
""The market's been under incredible pressure, concerned that the Fed is just going to go charging ahead,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""The Fed understands that and from their latest commentary they're starting to walk it back a little bit.""
U.S. markets have been highly sensitive to any hint that the Fed is ready to slow down or even take a pause. The central bank has lifted rates eight times since December 2015 in a bid to restore them to normal after having slashed borrowing costs to near zero to combat the financial crisis a decade ago.
Last month, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said rates were near the range of policymakers' estimates of ""neutral"" - the level at which they neither stimulate nor impede the economy - the S&P jumped by the most in eight months.
""There's no doubt there's been a shift in sentiment towards a more dovish Fed,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. 
Other FOMC members have recently weighed in. 
Earlier this month, Fed Governor Lael Brainard nodded to growing risks to growth overseas and in corporate debt markets at home. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard chimed in that investors were nervous that the Fed had gone too far. [nL1N1YC1E1]
According to their latest projections in September, the median view among policymakers was for three rate hikes in 2019. Interest rate futures used to gauge the probability of further hikes now reflect almost no chance of that happening.
""If you look back at even as late as September, there were probably three rate hikes priced in to 2019, where now there's right around one,"" Ripley said.
Some recent U.S. economic data, including an underwhelming jobs report and tepid inflation numbers, along with pressures such as the ongoing U.S.-China trade skirmish, also appear to support an argument for a pause in Fed tightening in 2019.
It is a mixed picture, though, as robust retail sales data for November showed consumer spending remained on solid ground, which could suggest no need for the Fed to let up. [nL1N1YJ0MA]
How the rest of December plays out likely comes down to how Fed officials communicate their view of a complex economic picture, said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.

""If you get a dovish-sounding (Fed) statement that stresses the fact that the economy is good, but given that there's no inflation to worry about we can take a pause, that could lead to a 7 to 8 percent rally into year-end.""

27,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 10:36PM ET</span>","China should free Canadians held after Huawei arrest, U.S.'s Pompeo says","By Lesley Wroughton and David Ljunggren
WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday China should free two Canadian citizens who were detained this week after authorities in Canada arrested a senior Chinese technology executive on a U.S. extradition warrant.
Pompeo's comments were the first by a senior U.S. official on the arrests, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said could escalate a growing trade conflict between China and the United States.
""The unlawful detention of two Canadian citizens is unacceptable,"" Pompeo told reporters after talks in Washington with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. ""They ought to be returned ... We ask all nations of the world to treat other citizens properly.""
Canadian officials were granted consular access on Friday to one of the two detainees in China and were still trying to contact the second, the Foreign Ministry said.
China detained the two - businessman Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) - after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1.
ICG President Robert Malley also called for Kovrig's release on Saturday.
""Michael's arrest is unjust. He should be freed immediately,"" Malley said in a statement.
""Far from being secretive, Michael's work was open for all to see, Chinese officials first and foremost,"" he said. Kovrig did not do anything to endanger China's national security, either as a diplomat or at the ICG, Malley said.
U.S. prosecutors accuse Meng of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, has said she is innocent.
Potentially complicating the case, U.S. President Donald Trump made comments this week that legal experts say may have undermined the U.S. basis for extradition.
Asked about the remarks, Freeland said: ""We all agree that the most important thing we can do is to uphold the rule of law, ensure that Ms. Meng's right to due process is respected and that the current judicial process in Canada remains apolitical.""
Trudeau, in his strongest comments on the matter to date, said China's detention of the two men was ""not acceptable.""
China rejects Trudeau's insistence that the government cannot interfere with the judiciary. Meng was released on bail this week but has to remain in Canada.
""This is one of the situations you get in when the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States, start picking a fight with each other,"" Trudeau told City TV in Toronto.
""The escalating trade war between them is going to have all sorts of unintended consequences on Canada, potentially on the entire global economy. We're very worried about that,"" he said.

Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, told a university conference on Friday that the prospects for deeper business ties were good despite the dispute. He declined to comment when pressed by reporters about Trudeau's remarks.

The state regulator of utilities found PG&E lacked sufficient staffing to locate and mark natural gas pipelines in compliance with law, leading staff to falsify data from 2012 to 2017.
""Utility falsification of safety related records is a serious violation of law and diminishes our trust in the utility's reports on their progress,"" commission President Michael Picker said in a statement. ""These findings are another example of why we are investigating PG&E's safety culture.""
""We're committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn't live up to that commitment in this case,"" PG&E said in response to a Reuters request for comment. 
PG&E said it continues to take additional actions to meet the regulatory standards. 
""We are aware of and cooperating with the CPUC's investigation,"" PG&E said.
The move by the California Public Utilities Commission comes as it investigates the cause of the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, in the state's deadliest-ever wildfire.
The recommendations, which were made following an investigation on the utility after the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion, include development of a comprehensive safety strategy, resource requirements and budgets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) defended on Friday an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department which allowed it to purchase health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) for $69 billion, a settlement that a federal judge is still assessing.
The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (N:WCG). That sale was completed in November.
Now, the Justice Department and companies have found themselves in the unusual position of defending their antitrust settlement to a skeptical federal judge. Most judges approve consent decrees aimed at resolving competition concerns with no fanfare, and deals normally close before the judge rules.
But Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in an order that he was ""less convinced"" than the government that the agreement would resolve antitrust concerns. He also has seemed annoyed that CVS closed its purchase of Aetna in October before his ruling.
In its brief, filed on Friday, CVS said that the deal had been extensively reviewed and urged the judge to allow the companies to continue integrating while he examines the settlement reached with the government.
CVS also noted that Aetna would be run separately from CVS, including decisions pricing and product offerings, during the court process. 
In its filing, the government urged the judge to allow the companies to press on with integration, saying he did not have the power to stop the merger, only to reject the settlement.
""The United States remains mindful of the court's responsibility to independently determine whether the proposed settlement is in the public interest and looks forward to discussing why the settlement meets that standard,"" the government said.
While CVS and Aetna operate in largely separate business segments, the deal attracted opposition from groups including the American Medical Association and independent pharmacists, represented by the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York and Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency.
The two pharmacist groups asked Leon to allow them to argue against the deal.

""We are asking the court to stop the consolidation so that the concerns of patients, providers and consumers can be heard,"" said Debbi Barber, president of New York pharmacists.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks have been rocked by trade tensions and monetary policy worries, shares of small-cap companies, by one measure, have now confirmed that they are in their first bear market in three years.
On Friday, the small-cap S&P 600 Index (SPCY) fell 1.6 percent to mark a 20.05 percent decline from its Aug. 31 closing high. A drop of 20 percent or more from a record or long-standing high closing level is the typical definition of a bear market.
Meanwhile, a more widely tracked gauge of small-cap performance, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT), is close on its heels with a 19 percent fall from its record high.
Small caps have endured the brunt of the selling in the latest market decline, largely due to their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. 
Earlier in the year, however, when the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell into correction with a 10.2 percent decline, small caps had outperformed, falling only around 9 percent, and they recovered more quickly. This time, large caps have fallen on average only about half as much as small caps, and the S&P 500 by contrast is down 11.3 percent.
Because they derive more of their revenue domestically than do large-cap companies, small caps were initially considered a relative refuge from the trade tensions that have roiled the markets for much of the year. The strength in the U.S. dollar, which makes products from large U.S. exporters more expensive for foreign customers, also provided a relative boost to small caps.
But in recent months, other issues, including worries over the Federal Reserve's course of interest-rate hikes and its potential impact on economic growth, have caused investors to retreat from small-cap stocks, which are generally considered riskier assets than large-cap equities.
""The smaller-cap companies back in the summer (were) considered a refuge,"" said George Dai, co-chief investment officer at Weatherbie Capital, a subsidiary of Alger. ""That part of the halo has been taken off.""
Concerns over the Fed's monetary policy have brought into focus another potential vulnerability for this group: Small-cap companies are more likely to raise debt funding via bank loans with adjustable rates than through fixed-rate bonds sold through capital markets, said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. 
As the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, the interest expenses for many small caps have risen, as has the possibility of them defaulting on their loans, especially as the pace of corporate earnings growth is expected to slow.
""It's the main reason we're seeing underperformance in small caps,"" Phipps said. ""There's no doubt small caps are much more interest-rate sensitive than large caps are.""
In contrast to large caps, small caps are generally more volatile and prone to more frequent bear market drops. Whereas the S&P 500 has been in an uninterrupted bull market since March 2009, the S&P 600 has endured two bear markets in the same period.

Small caps last fell into a bear market between June 2015 and February 2016, when they fell 20.7 percent. Before that they suffered a decline of nearly 27 percent between July and October 2011.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.02%, and is down 1.2% for the week. The S&P 500 dropped 1.91%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.26%.
A sea of red washed over Wall Street, as weak industrial output and retail sales from China and subdued eurozone growth data flagged concerns about global growth, prompting traders to abandon stocks.
The selloff was led by health care on the back of slump in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
Johnson & Johnson fell more than 10% after Reuters reported the company knew for decades that its talcum baby powder contained asbestos, something the company denied.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, weighed on tech as analysts continued to warn about weaker iPhone sales, sending its share price more than 3% lower.
TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cut his estimate for first quarter 2019 by 20% to a range of 38 million to 42 million units.
Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week, investors continued to abandon bank stocks, pressuring financials, which have fallen about 10% so far this month.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down on the day.
The corporate earnings front offered little solace for investors as Costco's (NASDAQ:COST) mixed results were punished, adding to concerns that retailers are set for a tough holiday period.
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets downplayed the results, citing store traffic growth that remained ""healthy.""
Autos, however, managed to weather the selloff storm somewhat after China said it will temporarily reduce tariffs on imports of American-made cars.
The Chinese Finance Ministry said in a statement that it will cut tariffs on car imports from the United States to 15% from 40% for three months starting Jan. 1.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) closed roughly flat for the day.
Strong retail sales data, meanwhile, were largely cast aside in the midst of the selloff, even as analysts said the data pointed to strong consumer spending and underlying strength in the broader economy.
""The strength of this number will surely force Q4 growth estimates higher. As for us, we went into this number looking for Q4 consumption of 3.2% and we will now take that to 3.5%. That takes Q4 GDP to 3.1% from 2.9%,"" RBC said in a note to clients.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Friday as weak data from China and Europe stoked fears of a global economic slowdown, while Johnson & Johnson slid after Reuters reported the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder.
Investors worried about global growth after China reported weak monthly retail sales growth and industrial output numbers, as disappointing economic data was released from Euro zone.
The Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) report, which the company has disputed, sent its shares tumbling 10.2 percent in heavy volume, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Industrials.
The pharma major also pulled down the S&P healthcare index (SPXHC) 3.6 percent, making it the biggest decliner among the 11 major sectors. The technology index (SPLRCT), which includes a number of companies with global operations, especially China, dropped 2.4 percent. 
Strong U.S. retail sales data appeared to have little impact on markets, with the S&P retail sector <.SPXRT> falling 2 percent.
""Solid fundamental data that gets to the core of the U.S. economy is overshadowed by the potential for a global slowdown washing up on our shores,"" said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.
But Blancato said he does not buy the thesis that slowing growth outside of the United States will hurt the U.S. economy and that the decline was a buying opportunity.
At 2:57 p.m. EST (1947 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 472.77 points, or 1.92 percent, to 24,124.61, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 47.63 points, or 1.80 percent, to 2,602.91 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 140.11 points, or 1.98 percent, to 6,930.22.
The market has struggled this week with choppy trading and has failed to hold on to opening levels in magnitude or direction on concerns ranging from U.S.-China trade talks, interest rates and a flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve to uncertainty over the shape of Brexit.
But investors appeared to shrug off Beijing's announcement it would suspend additional tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles and auto parts for three months starting Jan. 1. 
The S&P healthcare sector was last down 3.5 percent followed by a 2.7 percent decline in the energy index (SPNY) and technology stocks, which were down 2.4 percent.
Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) dropped 9 percent after reporting a fall in quarterly gross margin and was the biggest laggard in consumer staples.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) was another healthcare stock that declined, down 4.5 percent, after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the drugstore owner's shares.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell 2.8 percent, with some reports citing a top analyst slashing an iPhone sales estimate for the decline.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.96-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and 84 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded six new highs and 367 new lows.

50,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Pompeo Joins Trudeau in Decrying China’s Arrest of Canadians,"(Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China’s seizure of two Canadian citizens “unlawful,” language likely to further inflame tensions already running high over a trade dispute and the detention in Vancouver of a senior Chinese technology executive.
The comments from Donald Trump’s top diplomat come on the heels of similar remarks Friday from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the Chinese capture this week of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. The men, a Canadian diplomat on leave from his post in Hong Kong and an entrepreneur running cultural exchanges with North Korea respectively, are being held by Beijing on national security grounds.
“I can say this: The unlawful detention of two Canadian citizens is unacceptable, they ought to be returned,” Pompeo said. “The United States has stood for that whether they’re our citizens or citizens of other countries. We ask all nations of the world to treat other citizens properly and the detention of these two Canadian citizens in China ought to end.”
Canadian officials were allowed to visit Kovrig in Beijing Friday, but still haven’t haven’t been given access to Spavor four days after his arrest. Tensions between Trudeau’s government and China have been rising since the Dec. 1 detention of Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition request. The two countries jointly agreed to postpone a visit by Canada’s tourism minister next week.
‘Not Acceptable’
“China is reacting to the arrest of one of their citizens but we are being absolutely clear on standing up for our citizens who’ve been detained, trying to figure out why, trying to work with China to demonstrate this is not acceptable,” Trudeau told CityTV in a television interview aired Friday morning.
Trudeau reiterated that Canada’s courts are independent and that he cannot interfere in Meng’s case, despite Chinese outrage and demands for her release. She is free on bail in Vancouver pending extradition proceedings -- a process that could take years to play out. Chinese officials were able to meet with her on the day of her seizure, according to the Canadian government.
“This is one of the situations you get in when the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States, start picking a fight with each other,” the prime minister said.“The escalating trade war between them is going to have all sorts of unintended consequences on Canada, potentially on the entire global economy. We’re very worried about that.”
Subtle Rebuke
Freeland, speaking alongside Pompeo in Washington, reiterated Canada’s position that it can’t simply intervene in a legal proceeding, pushing back against Trump’s suggestion this week that he might free the Chinese executive if he got a good trade deal with the Asian nation.
“We all agreed that the most important thing we can do is to uphold the rule of law, ensure that Ms. Meng’s right to due process is respected, and that the current judicial process remains apolitical,” Freeland said, echoing comments she made after the U.S. president’s remarks earlier in the week.
Officials in Beijing, meanwhile, vented more frustration over Canada’s role in the Huawei executive’s case. “This action has aroused public anger in China,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a briefing Friday.
China arrested Kovrig and Spavor on Monday, but information was slow to trickle out. As of Wednesday, Canadian authorities had been notified, by fax, only of Kovrig’s arrest. Spavor’s status wasn’t confirmed until Thursday.
Kovrig took leave from his job with Canada’s foreign service to work with the International Crisis Group. Spavor is a North Korean fixer who has met with Kim Jong Un, and has brought clients including U.S. basketball icon Dennis Rodman to see the North Korean Leader.
Canada said its ambassador to China, John McCallum, met with Kovrig Friday, according to a statement by the foreign department. Asked about his condition at her Washington press conference, Freeland declined to comment citing concerns for his privacy but said “we’ve shared with his family details of the meeting.”
Tourism Minister Melanie Joly, meanwhile, had been scheduled to travel to China from Dec. 17 to 20. Her office announced Friday the trip has been postponed by mutual agreement. “Both governments agreed this would allow us to better achieve our shared objectives,” according to a separate Canadian government statement.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 02:29PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nissan probe into Ghosn trains lens on 'CEO Reserve' fund, Dutch unit","By Norihiko Shirouzu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd investigators are examining former Chairman Carlos Ghosn's use of an internal 'CEO Reserve' fund and the role of subsidiaries in the Netherlands and other countries as part of a probe into alleged financial misconduct, two people with knowledge of the inquiry told Reuters.
Ghosn and close associates spent money from a fund that some insiders dubbed 'the CEO Reserve' to help pay for residences used by the Ghosn family as well as for other personal expenses, the people said.
Investigators are separately checking whether capital from some subsidiaries was also used to pay for Ghosn family residences and whether such payments were split into small chunks to escape checks by internal financial staff and auditors, they added.
The existence of the fund and the investigators' scrutiny of how the subsidiaries' capital was used is being reported by Reuters for the first time.
The two sources with knowledge of the inquiry declined to be identified as Nissan has not publicly disclosed details of the probe.
Nissan spokesman Nick Maxfield said the Japanese automaker was still looking into the nature and extent of what it calls the misconduct by Ghosn. ""We are unable to comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigation at this time,"" he said.
Ghosn has denied wrongdoing, according to media reports. His lawyer in Tokyo, Motonari Otsuru, was unavailable for comment on this article, according to a person who answered the phone at his law office. 
In response to questions from Reuters about the CEO Reserve fund and other issues, two Ghosn representatives in the United States said they were unable to comment because they were not sufficiently familiar with the details.
Nissan fired Ghosn as chairman on Nov. 26, a week after he was arrested by Japanese prosecutors, accused of conspiring to understate his compensation by about half of the 10 billion yen ($88 million) awarded over five years from 2010. He was indicted this week and remains in detention.
Until recently one of the auto industry's most celebrated executives, Ghosn was seen as the anchor of Nissan's alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He has since been fired as chairman of Mitsubishi although Renault has stopped short of dismissing him from its helm.
SPLIT PAYMENTS
One focus of the probe is whether payments for the multi-million dollar residences were split by associates close to Ghosn into one million dollar chunks and then processed through a Nissan unit in the Netherlands called Zi-A Capital BV and its subsidiaries, which had been set up to invest in tech startups, one of the people said.
Reuters was not able to verify who was in charge of making the payments.
Done that way, the transactions may have escaped the attention of finance people within Nissan, Nissan's auditors and employees affiliated with the Nissan-Renault alliance, the people said.
""Why would (internal financial staff) go in and check one-million-dollar transactions in a subsidiary five, six levels or layers down and away from the global headquarters? They wouldn't do that,"" one individual familiar with the inquiry said. 
""Especially when amounts are less than one million dollars,"" the individual said. 
Ghosn's legal defense partly rests on the assertion that his compensation arrangements were vetted internally and by outside consultants, people familiar with the matter said. They did not identify the Nissan staff and external consultants who were in charge of the vetting.
The former Nissan chairman is prepared to argue that properties spanning cities across the globe were purchased by Nissan as corporate housing, these people said.
His co-defendant, former representative director Greg Kelly, who has been accused by prosecutors of conspiring with Ghosn about his compensation, has denied the allegations. Kelly's lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he was unaware of the content of Nissan's internal probe and was confident his client will be cleared of the charges brought against him.
Zi-A Capital BV was registered in the Netherlands as a company by Nissan Motor on Dec. 10 2010 with Kelly and Ghosn named as two of four directors at the time. Ghosn, who was also CEO, left as a director on Nov. 2, 2011, according to a company profile available with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.
The role of two of Zi-A Capital BV's subsidiaries, Zi-A Capital Ltd in Dubai and Hamsa Holdings Ltd in the British Virgin Islands, are also being checked by investigators, one of the people with knowledge of the probe said. 
Zi-A Capital BV is currently wholly owned by Nissan Motor Parts Center BV in the Netherlands, which is a unit of Nissan Automotive Europe SAS in France, which in turn is a wholly owned unit of Yokohama-based Nissan Motor.
Since investments in technology startups are generally considered confidential, the subsidiaries did not attract much attention from internal financial staff, the sources with knowledge of the probe said.
Nissan's auditor, Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, questioned the automaker's management several times, chiefly around 2013, about purchases of overseas luxury homes for Ghosn’s personal use and of stock-appreciation rights that were conferred on him, a person with direct knowledge of the matter has said. 
But the Japanese automaker said the transactions and financial reporting were appropriate, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Nissan declined to comment. A representative for Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC could not immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for the auditor has previously said he could not comment on specific cases when asked about the matter.

The CEO Reserve was set up to pay for unplanned business needs and could at times contain 'a few hundred million dollars', one of the people with knowledge of the inquiry said. 
""For example, if you have an autonomous drive company you'd want to buy right now, you'd use that budget,"" the second person with knowledge of the matter said.
According to one of the people, the team is reviewing ""a mountain"" of receipts and other financial records to see if purchases of residences in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut and Paris as well as expenses such as a yacht club membership and a donation to a college had been approved and paid for properly.
One of the apartments in Rio de Janeiro has been the subject of a heated legal dispute between Nissan and Ghosn, with Nissan losing a battle to block Ghosn and his family from accessing the apartment. Nissan had argued that access could result in the destruction of evidence of crimes.
Ghosn used the CEO Reserve to also pay for family vacation trips, utilities and even potato chips, one of the people with knowledge of the probe said.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>",2018: The year volatility came home to roost,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are down only slightly for 2018, but that masks a volatile year for investors.
Trade-related tensions between the United States and China, weakness in the tech sector, concerns about slowing global growth and jitters about the Federal Reserve marching toward higher interest rates have kept investors on their toes.
Daily gyrations for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) spiked sharply this year and remain near a one-year high.
One-month historical volatility - a measure of how much stocks have swung on a daily basis over the course of a month - has risen to 21 percent, up from about 7 percent a year ago. 
(Graphic: Daily gyrations for the S&P 500 Index - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SJjOaH)
That jump has fueled option traders' expectations for future stock swings. The Cboe Volatility Index, a widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, has logged an average daily close of 15.8 so far in 2018, up from 11.2 last year.
(Graphic: Wall Street fear gauge - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PC6nHx)
And option traders expect stock gyrations to persist beyond just the near term. The VIX futures curve, which depicts prices of contracts of different expiration dates, is very flat, indicating traders expect the VIX will hang around current levels for the foreseeable future.

Speculators' positions in VIX futures have also undergone a sea change. Asset managers, leveraged funds and other reporting classes that make up the so-called buy side are net long VIX futures. A year ago, they were significantly net short.
(Graphic: Buy side positions in VIX futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PCm0P8)
U.S. equity investors, who spent 2017 cocooned in one of the most tranquil periods in history, were jolted by the return of volatility. The resurgence was so extreme it derailed several products that employed VIX futures.
Some VIX-linked products that thrived in the calm of 2017 went belly up, and the number of VIX futures open contracts logged its largest percentage decline in a decade.

The turmoil in equity markets has meanwhile spurred a rush of options trading and boosted U.S. equity options trading volume to a record high year.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 02:03PM ET</span>",J&J shares nosedive on report it knew of asbestos in Baby Powder,"By Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) - Shares of Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) fell 10 percent on Friday and were on track to post their biggest percentage drop in more than 16 years, after Reuters reported that the pharma major knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder.
The decline in shares erased about $40 billion from the company's market capitalization, with investors worrying about the impact of the report as it faces thousands of talc-related lawsuits.
The stock was the biggest drag on the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) indexes and was among the most traded on U.S. exchanges. About 28 million shares exchanged hands by 1830 GMT, more than three times its 25-day moving average.
J&J was found to have known about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed.
The report also said the company had commissioned and paid for studies conducted on its Baby Powder franchise and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.
In response to the report, the company said ""any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""
""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to the report.
The company also said Baby Powder was asbestos-free and added it would continue to defend the safety of its product.
At least two Wall Street analysts said the stock appeared to be oversold on the news.
""In our opinion litigation overhangs are real, and we do not minimize the situation, but the stock pull back does seem over done to us,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said.
J&J, in 1976, had assured the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 when at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc.
The company has been battling more than 10,000 cases claiming its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The products have also been linked with mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities. 
""We believe it is highly unlikely the company's exposure to this talc issue will even come close to the $40 billion in lost market cap today,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.
They added that talc was not an issue that would resolve quickly for J&J and expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company’s exposure to the issue.
While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed to a mere 0.5 percent of its revenue of $76.5 billion last year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against the company.
However, Baby Powder is considered essential to J&J's image as a caring company – a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.
CFRA Research analyst Colin Sarcola said, ""We see today's news potentially impacting sales of everything from baby shampoo to prosthetic hips.""
""Given these elevated risks, we no longer feel JNJ shares are attractive at recent prices,"" Sarcola added.

Shares were last down 8 percent at $135.85, also pulling down the broader S&P 500 healthcare index (SPXHC).

Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) reported mixed results for its fiscal first quarter. Sales beat, but earnings fell short of expectations, which sent the retailer's shares spiralling more than 8%.
But RBC Capital Markets recommending buying the stock on pullback, citing ""healthy"" growth in store traffic.
Costco has been ramping up spending to compete against rivals like Amazon’s Whole Foods and Walmart’s Sam’s Club., pressuring gross margins, which fell about 50 basis points to 10.75% during the quarter.
“The company said fulfillment costs are also pressuring core gross margin, and we believe price investments continue to be a headwind,” Stifel said in a note.
E-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) tapped the equity market to raise cash to fund its growth strategies, offering 2.6 million Class A subordinate voting shares. Its shares fell more than 9%.
The duo's sharp losses offset data showing overall retail sales rose 0.2% in November, topping forecasts, according to the Commerce Department.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Cloud hangs over Italy's Stefanel and OVS after autumn warnings,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian clothing groups Stefanel and OVS face an urgent quest to convince investors that they can overhaul their business models after trading disappointments.
Stefanel, the higher-end brand, has to present an Italian court with a restructuring plan to gain protection from its creditors, while OVS is in talks with its banks in an effort to gain more flexibility on its debt repayments.
Both companies, which have been fighting for years to establish their position on the high-street where they have to compete with larger and faster group including Zara's  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M, have promised a business revamp.
Fashion companies as a whole are having to adapt their collections, moving away from the traditional two season a year pace, as younger clients demand new items more often, social media requests higher innovation and weather patterns change.
An exceptionally mild autumn in Europe has hit many fashion retailers, including low-cost clothing group OVS, whose shares dropped by more than a third on Thursday after it issued a profit warning on Wednesday. 
Stefanel shares fell by five percent after it said on Thursday it had filed for a credit protection scheme, adding that it would launch a corporate restructuring.
OVS, which was listed in 2015 after being spun off from retailer Coin, had reported on Wednesday a 11 percent fall in like-for-like sales in the period between August and October.
This echoed a profit warning issued by British fashion retailer Superdry, which blamed unusually warm weather for hitting sales of winter jackets and sweaters.
OVS said it would not be able to recover the performance lost in the third quarter by the end of the year and CEO Stefano Beraldo told analysts that it would continue to suffer in 2019 as it cut prices to get rid of excess stock.
""(We must) shorten the lead time, to buy later and to buy better ... because the market is very difficult to predict,"" Beraldo told analysts at a conference call after the results.
Analysts were cautious on the OVS saying that it would take time to regain investors' confidence.
""A stock re-rating is strongly tied to a good delivery, while to restore investors' confidence which was dented once again with this reporting season will take time,"" brokerage Banca IMI (LON:IMI) said in a report for clients.
Meanwhile, Stefanel said it wanted to switch from a seasonal business model based on two collections a year to one that would allow it to refresh items for sale much more frequently.
OVS had net debt of 440 million euros at the end of October, more than four times its core earnings. At the same date Stefanel reported net debt of 62.5 million euros and net equity of 7.5 million euros.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>","Ousted Nissan boss' daughter takes documents, cash from apartment","By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO/TOKYO (Reuters) - The daughter of ousted Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn early on Friday retrieved documents and cash from a corporate apartment in Rio de Janeiro, capping a legal battle over the items, which the carmaker maintains may contain evidence of wrongdoing.
The midnight visit by Ghosn's daughter Caroline, accompanied by two court officers and multiple Nissan lawyers, came after a week-long legal brawl over the apartment, especially the contents of three safes. An appelate judge on Thursday granted her access to the beachfront apartment over the objections of Nissan.
Brazilian-born Ghosn was arrested last month and indicted this week in Japan for allegedly under-reporting his income. Nissan also accuses him of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses.
Nissan has said the contents of the safes would include documents detailing irregularities and cried foul because its lawyers were not allowed to see safes being opened last night. A spokeswoman for Ghosn said there were no documents in them. 
Both parties agree that documents were found in the apartment but outside the safe. Nissan representatives unsuccessfully tried to review the papers, a company spokesman said. 
""Nissan's representatives observed Mr. Ghosn's representatives removing two plastic folders containing documents,"" Nissan spokesman Nick Maxfield said in a statement. ""We believe that these documents cannot possibly have been of a personal nature.""
Devon Spurgeon, the spokesperson for Ghosn, said the documents were old agendas from a previous business trip to Brazil. Nissan pointed to a folder entitled ""Resende plant,"" which Spurgeon said was an agenda.
Resende, the site of Nissan's newest plant in Brazil, was the main pretext for Nissan to buy the apartment, located in the famed Copacabana neighborhood. 
CASH AND A BACKGAMMON SET
Two judicial officers witnessed the opening of the safes, Spurgeon said, acknowledging that Nissan's lawyers, who were present for the rest of the proceedings, were not allowed to see their contents. 
She added that what was in the safes were the equivalent of $20,000 in cash in Brazilian currency and a gifted wallet that Ghosn disliked. She said the third safe was not really a safe, but just a small lockbox with keys.
When the documents were found, both parties agree, Nissan asked a judge to be allowed to see the documents but the request was denied, which the carmaker says was ""irregular"" on the part of the courts.
Ghosn family denies that.
""At every point the family followed judicial protocol,"" Spurgeon said, adding there was nothing to the documents. ""Nissan called the judge, and the judge made the decision to side with the [Ghosn] family.""
Spurgeon said the daughter also took clothing, a backgammon set and other personal items they had purchased.

Ghosn, who brought Nissan back from the brink of bankruptcy and become one of the most powerful car executives in the world, has been in a Japan prison since his arrest. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing, according to media reports, and has appealed unsuccessfully for his detention to be overturned.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Germany's Altmaier sees no disorderly Brexit, hopeful on U.S. trade ties","By Gernot Heller and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy minister does not expect a disorderly Brexit and believes the danger of a major trade conflict between the European Union and the United States is not yet over but has also not grown, he told Reuters on Friday.
In a wide-ranging interview, Peter Altmaier said Germany was on track for orderly growth in its 10th year of expansion next year - so long as it avoided a significant trade dispute.
""The danger of a major trade conflict between the U.S. and Europe is not yet over but it has not grown,"" he said. ""We are in good and constructive talks but we are not out of the woods yet.""
He expected economic growth this year in Germany, Europe's largest economy, ""of or above 1.5 percent.""
On Brexit, Altmaier said: ""I don't think there will be a disorderly Brexit. I think there are sufficient responsible politicians across the political spectrum in Britain who want to and will avoid a chaotic Brexit.""
Altmaier has been leading a review of the rules for foreign companies to invest in German firms, and said: ""I expect that very soon we can agree on the necessary amendments.""
The takeover of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333) in 2016 spooked Germany, as did the surprise purchase earlier this year of a 9.7 percent stake in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) by Chinese carmaker Geely. [GEELY.UL]
Altmaier said his proposed amendments were ""aimed foremost at the question of national security and critical infrastructure, and then in my view it is not a matter of whether a foreign company takes 25 percent of a company or less.""
HUAWEI NOT BLACKLISTED
Pressed on whether Berlin was concerned about the prospect of Chinese firm Huawei  building out Germany's fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, Altmaier said: ""There are no concerns about individual companies.""
""But each product, each device must be secure if it is going to be used in Germany,"" he added.
U.S. officials have briefed allies that Huawei is ultimately at the beck and call of the Chinese state, while warning that its network equipment may contain ""back doors"" that could open them up to cyber espionage.
""Independent of Huawei, we must set ourselves the challenge that the German security services know whether a particular product may be used in Germany or not,"" Altmaier said, adding that countries could only win a leading position in the digital era if they deliver ""a high degree of data protection"".
Europe has fallen behind big U.S. tech giants such as Google (O:GOOGL), Uber , Amazon (O:AMZN) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) on artificial intelligence, he said, adding: ""We need an industrial actor (in Europe) that it is in a position to compete with these companies.""
""That, in turn, will only work when industry, the economy and the state meet this challenge together,"" Altmaier said, adding that this could possibly involve a state equity holding ""at the outset"".
Europe should also produce 20 to 30 percent of global battery cells, crucial components in the dawning age of electric cars, Altmaier said. He again held out the prospect of the state playing a supporting role, though not by taking an equity stake.
""That will only happen with private companies that we could support with state means in the start-up phase,"" Altmaier said.

He expected ""one or two consortia at least"" would be ready to embark on battery production next year, adding that he was meeting France's economy minister next Monday and would discuss how they could offer state support.

PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods maker LVMH (PA:LVMH) has agreed to buy Belmond (N:BEL), the owner of hotels including Venice's landmark Cipriani, for a total of $3.2 billion to raise its profile in upmarket hospitality. 
LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already has hotels including the Cheval Blanc in the prestigious Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvlgari hotels.
The Belmond deal is LVMH's largest since it spent 4.3 billion euros in 2011 to buy Bvlgari and 6.5 billion euros in 2017 to gain full control of Christian Dior.
It will have a limited impact of its debt and boost 2018 earnings per share, before synergies by just 0.1 percent.
LVMH will ""reach critical mass in the ultimate luxury hotel world with one single acquisition,"" finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a call.
""The priority is to develop and improve the profitability of these exceptional brands and nurture complementarity with the LVMH group brands,"" he added
The acquisition will give it properties including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in southern Peru, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, moving LVMH further into the fast-growing ""experiential"" high-end travel and hospitality sector.
The transaction follows a wave of deals in the luxury hotels sector, including AccorHotels' (PA:ACCP) purchase of FRHI Holdings, the parent of the Fairmont and Raffles hotels.
""While some investors may question the acquisition, which appears to lie outside LVMH group's core operations, we believe it is consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience,"" Berenberg analysts said in a research note. 
""LUXURY EXPERIENCES""
Guiony said the deal reflected LVMH's belief that ""the future of luxury is in luxury goods and in luxury experiences"".
It also pushes LVMH further into new luxury services at a time of growing concern that Chinese demand for high-end fashion and handbags will start waning amid worries about the health of the world's second-largest economy and potential damage from Washington's protracted trade spat with Beijing.
LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday's closing price. 
The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, values Belmond's equity at $2.6 billion, and the group, including debt, at $3.2 billion.
Belmond posted earnings of $140 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on revenue of $572 million in the 12 months to Sept. 30. Half of revenue comes from Europe and 20 percent from North America.
At 1520 GMT, LVMH shares were down 0.9 percent at 253.45 euros in a weak European stock market (FTEU3) while Belmond shares jumped 40 percent in New York to $24.74.
RBC Capital Markets analysts said the price of the deal - at 5.6 times recent sales and 22.9 times recent EBITDA - looked ""optically high"", but added: ""Belmond owns a unique portfolio of trophy real estate assets, that will allow LVMH to increase its exposure to experiential luxury"".
LVMH ended up paying a multiple of 19 times Belmond’s expected EBITDA for next year, according to Refinitiv data. Bigger hotel chains like Hilton and Marriott International (O:MAR) trade on forward multiples of just over 12 times.

Belmond owns, partly owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants and train and river-cruise properties located in exotic and distinctive destinations worldwide.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors cashed out of equity funds at a record pace over the past week, with redemptions hitting $39 billion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) said on Friday.
Investment grade bond fund outflows also touched a record high of $8.4 billion up to Wednesday, in what was a ""capitulation out of stocks, investment grade (and) financials,"" according to BAML. 
U.S. stocks had a similarly torrid week, with U.S. equity funds recording their second-largest ever week of redemptions at $27.6 billion, the bank said in a note after analyzing EPFR flow data. 
This meant that year-to-date outflows from U.S. equity funds is also around of $27.6 billion, with the number being essentially flat the week before last. 
With Britain's Brexit political drama intensifying, investors have now pulled $9.8 billion out of UK equity funds so far in 2018, more than in any previous year. 
But year-to-date inflows into Japanese equities at $63.57 billion and emerging market stocks at $50.92 billion helped keep the overall equity flows overwhelmingly positive for 2018 at $74 billion. 
It has been a different story for high-yield and investment grade bond fund this year so far, with record redemptions of $63 billion. 
Investors retreated to the safety of government bonds, with those funds recording $3.2 billion of inflows over the past week, $20 billion over the past 10 weeks, and $46 billion year-to-date. 

""Investors have no satisfactory answers to the existential questions of 'If not stocks, what?', 'If not tech, what?' (and) 'If not the U.S. dollar, what?'"" BAML researchers said in the note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Friday said it is beginning to send formal notices to U.S. government agencies of its plan to end production at auto plants and cut thousands of jobs as it shrinks passenger car production in North America.
The largest U.S. automaker said 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at four American plants that will end production next year are eligible for new jobs at other plants.
GM said it currently has 2,700 current open positions at seven plants in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee and Texas, with about 1,000 of those open jobs at an assembly plant in Flint, Michigan.
GM said more than 1,100 U.S. employees at plants losing production have already volunteered to transfer to other GM U.S. plants, while 1,200 are eligible to retire. 
With normal attrition rates, a GM spokesman said the company is confident that all affected hourly workers will be eligible for another job if willing to move to another plant.
GM said many salaried employees at plants losing production ""will have opportunities at other GM locations.""
The formal layoff notices will begin going to government agencies on Friday and will continue into 2019, GM said.
GM Chairman and Chief Executive Mary Barra, who came under fire from lawmakers for how the automaker disclosed the job cuts last month, said in a statement Friday that GM's ""focus remains on providing interested employees options to transition including job opportunities at other GM plants.""
GM shares rose 1.3 percent in trading Friday.
GM said in November it will cease production at five North American plants next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs. GM is ending production of a half dozen cars, citing slow-selling sedans as one reason for the need to restructure.
A big chunk of the job cuts include plans to trim 15 percent of GM's North American salaried workforce by early next year.
GM said salaried workers who are losing their jobs are receiving ""out-placement services including job search assistance, career counseling, resume writing and interview skills.""
GM, which announced in November it is ending production at its Oshawa assembly plant in Canada, said it is working with ""dealers, local colleges and other employers to train and help secure jobs for impacted workers from the Oshawa Assembly Plant who are interested.""

Two U.S. senators earlier asked GM other questions on the layoff impacts, including how many jobs will be cut at suppliers as a result.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Special Report: J&J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder,"By Lisa Girion
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.
She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.
Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? “She wanted answers,” her daughter Cady Evans said.
Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson’s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), alleging that “poisonous talc” in the company’s beloved product was her killer.
J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.
Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. “When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,” he said. “We didn’t have it.”
That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company’s talc caused their cancers — including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.
A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.
The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.
A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.
""RATHER HIGH""
The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J’s Italian supplier as fibrous and “acicular,” or needle-like, tremolite. That’s one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.
At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J’s supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as “fiberform” and “rods.”
In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was “detected in any sample” of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn’t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc – in one case at levels reported as “rather high.”
Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J’s testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected – and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.
The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.
The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J’s testing documentation.
What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs’ lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn’t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.
In two cases earlier this year – in New Jersey and California – juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.
A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J’s potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.
At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.
""JUNK"" SCIENCE
J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, “junk” science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.
""Plaintiffs’ attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,” Ernie Knewitz, J&J’s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters’ findings. “This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.”
J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.
The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters’ findings as “false and misleading.” “The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,” Bicks wrote. “This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos.” He dismissed tests cited in this article as “outlier” results.
In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up “background” asbestos – stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.
The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades – in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J’s corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users “would have, more likely than not, been exposed,” the plaintiffs’ lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.
Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: “I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,” Sanchez told the jury.
Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.
Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys SA, a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Both companies said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the Paris-based company’s tests “consistently show no asbestos. Talc’s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.”
J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J’s $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker’s carefully tended image as a caring company – a “sacred cow,” as one 2003 internal email put it.
“When people really understand what’s going on, I think it increases J&J’s exposure a thousand-fold,” said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.
The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn’t shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company’s Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had “strong grounds on appeal.”
J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: “We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.”
Gorsky’s comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure – 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.
""SAFETY FIRST""
In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the “Safety First” motto. Johnson’s Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.
Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants’ diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson’s Baby Powder.
In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That’s one of six minerals – along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite – that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable “non-asbestiform” rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.
J&J’s worry at the time was that contaminants made the company’s powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much “grit” as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained “from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,” described as mostly fibrous and “acicular” tremolite.
Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company’s talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was “cleavage fragments” from non-asbestiform tremolite.
J&J’s original records don’t always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, “makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,” agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.
And as the product safety director for J&J’s talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: “(I)f a deposit contains ‘non-asbestiform’ tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.”
""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""
In 1964, J&J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.
Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J’s talc supply for decades.
J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was “normal” to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. “Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,” Ashton wrote. “How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?”
Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, “it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite … to an absolute minimum,” came the reply from another physician executive days later.
The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder’s son and then-retired CEO, had expressed “concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,” he wrote.
“We have replied,” the doctor wrote, that “we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard.” Such assurances would be impossible, he added, “if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.”
The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because “it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.”
NEVER ""100% CLEAN""
By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.
Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon’s newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.
By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.
They shared their preliminary findings with New York City’s environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.
The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: “Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.”
Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a “relatively small” amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.
Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of “antagonistic personalities” in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an “attack on talc.”
“I suppose I was antagonistic,” Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn’t find asbestos – a result that Mount Sinai announced.
Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.
Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. “I said to myself, ‘How come it took so long?’ ” he said.
In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared “evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.”
Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company’s public relations department that J&J’s talc contained trace amounts of “fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).”
""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""
As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount “insignificant” and the samples “substantially free of asbestiform material.” J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the “results clearly show” the samples tested “contain no chrysotile asbestos.” J&J’s lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.
But J&J’s FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson’s finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample – “incontrovertible asbestos,” as he described it in a lab note.
The FDA’s own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: “I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.”
By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J’s Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.
“It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,” Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the “process may well be valuable property to us.”
At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: “We will want to carefully consider the … patents re asbestos in talc. It’s quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.”
J&J did not obtain the patents.
While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company’s Vermont mining operation. “Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,” he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. “And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.”
J&J should “protect our powder franchise” by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborne talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that “no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles.” Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, “is obviously another answer.”
Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.
Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative “for defensive reasons” because “the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.”
""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""
A few months after Petterson’s recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency’s cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.
At the time, J&J’s Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for “an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos.” That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA’s proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.
The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, “we may have problems.”
The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company’s own researchers had earlier used to identify a “tremolite-type” asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: “It may be too sensitive.”
In his email to Reuters, J&J’s lawyer said the lab supervisor’s concern was that the test would result in “false positives,” showing asbestos where there was none.
J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA’s new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.
“It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,” the minutes state.
In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since “a substantial safety factor can be expected” with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, “methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.”
Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it “foolish,” adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: “No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.”
PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION
Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.
“The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,” the cover letter said. “We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.”
In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected “in any sample.”
J&J didn’t tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J – “fiberform” actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as “asbestos fibers” in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. “Some of them seem rather high,” the private lab wrote in its cover letter.
Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab’s results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found “was not asbestiform,” based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.
Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, “fibrous anthophyllite” and other types of asbestos had been “found in association with the Hammondsville ore body” – the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.
Zeitz’s May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc “strongly urged” the adoption of ways to protect “against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.”
Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.
The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, “it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.”
""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""
J&J’s selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge’s decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. “Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,” Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.
“J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge’s comments,” Bicks said. “J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.”
The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.
Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.
Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.
The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.
X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J’s lawyer said the company’s tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J’s X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.
But the company never adopted the Colorado lab’s 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn’t guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.
As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J’s longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, “will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims.” He described this sort of testing as both “sophisticated” and “disturbing.”
""FREE OF HAZARD""
By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J’s “Defense of Talc Safety” campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be “free of hazard.” It attributed “this growing opinion” to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of “favorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.”
In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency’s investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. “So in subsequent analyses,” he told the paper, “we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.”
Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.
In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder – to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.
The persistence of the industry’s view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It’s also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don’t apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc – even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.
Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry’s position, saying on its website: “All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.”
After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry’s standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States “should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.”
The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as “carcinogenic to humans.”
Despite the success of J&J’s efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company’s test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: “The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.”
Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on “important environmental issues” in its talc reserves that there was “past tremolite” in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.
Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, “were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.”
Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.
In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded – a finding deemed “BDL” – below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as “background asbestos” that did not come from any talc source.
In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. “I recognize the concern,” he told Reuters. He said the agency’s policing of cosmetics in general – fewer than 30 people regulating a “vast” industry – was “a place where we think we can be doing more.”
Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to “look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk.” An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining “scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.”
""FISHING EXPEDITION""
Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn’t exceed OSHA limits.
That’s why he zeroed in on Johnson’s Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.
Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.
J&J objected. Hobson’s “fishing expedition” would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson’s request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company’s Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite “asbestos” needles.
Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker’s lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had “no evidence” Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.
Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker’s lung tissue contained tens of thousands of “long fibers” of four different types of asbestos. The findings were “consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,” the report concluded.
“The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,” Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J’s dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.
Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.
Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: “They knew what the problems were, and they hid it.” J&J’s records would have made a “100% difference” in Coker’s case.
Had the information about asbestos in J&J’s talc come out earlier, he said, “maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure” for other people.
Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because “the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff’s disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.”
Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.
Coker’s daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.
“When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,” Deckard said. “I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?”

(Reuters) - Merck and Co (N:MRK) said on Friday it will buy privately held French company Antelliq Group, which makes digital identification products for livestock, for about 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion) to bolster its fast-growing animal health business.
The move affirms the drugmaker's commitment to the business, which Wall Street analysts have long seen value in separating just as rival drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) did. 
Pfizer's Zoetis (N:ZTS) raised $2.2 billion in a 2013 IPO, while Elanco (N:ELAN), the former animal health business at Lilly, raised $1.51 billion from an IPO in September.
Merck's Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier had said in October that the company was a ""good owner"" of its animal health unit.
""We believe that we run this business very well inside the company compared to our competitors,"" he had said.
Merck's unit has been a big player in the animal health segment, bringing in sales of $3.88 billion in 2017. Zoetis recorded $5.31 billion in revenue, while Elanco brought Lilly $3.09 billion in sales the same year. 
Merck said Antelliq will be a wholly owned and separately operated subsidiary within its animal health division.
Antelliq's products, which brought in 360 million euros ($406.51 million) in sales in the year ended Sept. 30, provide veterinarians, farmers and pet owners with digital technology that monitors animals and predicts disease in them.
These products allow access to real-time, actionable information to help improve livestock management and health outcomes, Merck said in a statement.
Merck will assume Antelliq's debt of 1.15 billion euros ($1.30 billion), which it intends to repay shortly after the closing of the deal, expected in the second quarter of 2019. 
Private equity firm BC Partners currently owns a majority stake in Antelliq.
Merck's shares fell nearly 1 percent to $77.70 before the bell.

Etihad Airways' decision to withdraw funding for Air Berlin had sent the formerly second-largest airline in Germany into insolvency. The administrator had said that Etihad did not meet its financial obligations towards Air Berlin.
""The claims are for payment of 500 million and the establishment that the defendant is obliged to pay further damages. The Chamber has provisionally set the amount in dispute at up to 2 billion euros,"" the court said in a statement.
Etihad was not immediately available for comment. The airline has until the end of January to respond to the suit, according to the court.
Etihad owned a 29 percent stake in Air Berlin and had been providing funding since becoming a shareholder in early 2012. In April 2017, Etihad sent a letter of support to Air Berlin, saying it would provide funding for the next 18 months.
But just months later, Etihad said it would no longer provide funding, saying Air Berlin's business had deteriorated at an unprecedented pace. 
The administrator said this doomed Air Berlin, whose assets have since been carved up and sold off.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks worldwide tumbled on Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe fanned concerns of a global economic slowdown and left investors fretting over the wider impact of a still-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. 
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was down over half a percent by afternoon in Europe. Futures indicated a weak open on Wall Street. 
Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed.
Another survey showed French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years in the face of violent anti-government protests.
Germany's private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low, meanwhile, suggesting growth in Europe's largest economy may be weak in the final quarter.
The data out of Europe added to weak readings from China, where November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States.
Stock markets in Europe fell sharply, with Germany's DAX index falling by as much as 1-1/2 percent. It was last down 0.8 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.8 percent, after falling over 1 percent earlier. (EU)
""The data this morning out of France really hasn't helped the mood. You look at China data, you look at the flash PMIs out of France and Germany and they've really sort of reinforced concerns that the global economy is slowing down,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
""Ultimately, I think it rather questions the wisdom of the ECB ending its asset purchase program at the end of this month. You've got Mario Draghi basically tightening into a downturn.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei, also dragged down by the country's weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent.
China's benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent.
A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing.
""The market's softer after Chinese retail sales. They're still quite stellar growth, they were lower than expected and enough to concern the market,"" said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.
The Chinese yuan weakened 0.4 percent to 6.9020 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. 
Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. 
U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added.
In the currency market, the euro was down 0.7 percent after the weak PMIs, last changing hands at $1.1293.[FRX/]
Sterling fell more than half a percent to below $1.26 after Prime Minister Theresa May returned from a visit to Brussels, where she failed to win assurances from European Union leaders over her Brexit withdrawal agreement.[GBP/]
The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish ""backstop"" is never triggered.
The dollar stood at 113.61 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day but above this week's low of 112.245 set on Monday.
Oil prices fell after China reported slower economic growth, pointing to lower fuel demand in the world's biggest oil importer, although market sentiment was supported by supply cuts agreed last week by major crude producers. [O/R]
U.S. crude futures fell 0.7 percent to $52.22 per barrel and Brent crude slid 0.8 percent to $60.94, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China Development Bank supervising HNA asset sales - sources,"By Kane Wu, Shu Zhang and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB) is leading a team to supervise HNA Group's asset disposals as the heavily indebted conglomerate scales back operations to a point that will leave it holding only core assets, people familiar with the situation said.
The finance-to-aviation group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the group stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets.
Faced with soaring debts and China's crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, HNA has pushed ahead with asset sales that have so far included real estate, stakes in hotels groups and discussions on key overseas units such as Ingram Micro and its luxury $300-million-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"".
A work group, led by China's largest policy bank CDB as HNA's biggest creditor, moved into HNA headquarters in Haikou in the southern province of Hainan in the second half of the year and is closely monitoring its asset sales, the people said. 
The bank is not involved in individual sale negotiations but any deal would need its nod, according to two of the people.
Last month, Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), HNA's main domestic carrier, said it was seeking a 7.5 billion yuan ($1.09 billion) loan from a group led by CDB, to help cover operating expenses. 
Earlier this month, financing from CDB was instrumental in Airbus (PA:AIR) resuming stalled delivery of planes to HNA-affiliated airlines.
CDB is pushing HNA to get its house in order by the middle of next year, said two of the people, who could not be named as the information is confidential. 
""It looks like the regulators have gone beyond simply cutting back HNA's assets and maybe moving toward complete dissolution of the company but they have yet to declare that as the official policy,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, which focuses on China.
An HNA spokesman said the group was refocusing its strategy around its core aviation-related assets to improve operations and strengthen its balance sheet. 
""The company has remained disciplined and thoughtful as it takes decisive actions to streamline its portfolio and organizational structure,"" he said.
CDB declined to comment. 
BACK TO CORE
HNA is planning to shed assets and retain only Hainan Airlines and its logistics business, three of the people said.
It has been engaged with potential investors for its stakes in two Hong Kong-based carriers, Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express Airways, two of them said. 
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings had expressed interest in the airlines but walked away in the end, according to one of them. 
HNA is also in talks to bring in new investors as controlling shareholders in its smaller regional airlines in China, the people said. 
On Wednesday, HNA signed an agreement with state-owned Beijing Tourism Group to transfer shares in Beijing Capital Airlines.
""Overseas airlines and domestic regional airlines are not part of the core businesses and will likely go off its books,"" said a Hong Kong-based hedge fund analyst, who has been following HNA's unwinding of assets. 
Last month, Hainan Airlines agreed a restructuring of its Urumqi Air unit which involved ceding majority control to the Urumqi government and leaving it with 30 percent.
Founded in 1989 as an airlines operator in China's Hainan island, HNA had been aggressively buying overseas assets and expanding its businesses since 2015, aiming to build a global empire with trophy holdings such as stakes in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Hilton Hotels Worldwide Holdings (N:HLT).
Less than three years later, HNA has found itself reversing track. It has sold over $12 billion in overseas assets this year and has at least $23 billion more to offload, according to Reuters calculations based on filings and media reports.
The conglomerate has disposed nearly 300 billion yuan ($43.6 billion) worth of assets in 2018, its chairman Chen Feng told local magazine Caijing in November.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Domestic investors have sought nearly double the number of shares offered by SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) soon-to-list wireless unit, two sources from a lead IPO underwriter said, underscoring strong demand for Japan's third-largest telco.
Overseas institutional investors have sought more than three times the number of available shares, the sources said on Friday on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to disclose the figures publicly. Domestic investors will buy more than 80 percent of the offering.
Strong retail demand for the float was further underscored by Japan's SBI Holdings (T:8473), which earlier in the day said it had sold all its allotted shares in SoftBank's telecoms unit.
SBI is one of the lead underwriters for the domestic portion of what is set to be Japan's largest-ever IPO. An error with its allocation of shares to investors had earlier led to rumors of lower-than-expected appetite. 
The telecoms unit, SoftBank Corp <9434.T>, priced its IPO this week at an indicated 1,500 yen ($13.22) per share, and said it would sell an extra 160 million shares to meet the demand, raising about $23.5 billion.
There are, however, some concerns weighing on investors' minds ahead of the unit's trading debut in Tokyo on Dec. 19.
Among those is the scrutiny of SoftBank's relationship with Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] as governments around the world move to shut out the Chinese firm amid worries its gear could facilitate Chinese spying. 
SoftBank plans to replace 4G network equipment from Huawei with hardware from other suppliers, two sources said, a process that is likely to be time-consuming and expensive.
There are also concerns around reliability of alternative suppliers after a software glitch in Ericsson (ST:ERICb) equipment caused widespread network disruption for SoftBank customers last week, said one of the sources who is a senior government official.
The disruption sent SoftBank Corp CEO Ken Miyauchi rushing to the telecoms ministry to apologize. Japan is considering officially reprimanding SoftBank and telling it to ensure the disruption does not reoccur, the source said. 
Shares of SoftBank Group closed down 4.6 percent on Friday, taking this month's decline to about 11 percent. The benchmark index (N225) dropped 2 percent.

103,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 05:34AM ET</span>","Scale of theft at Shell's Singapore refinery much greater, court docs show","By Roslan Khasawneh and Fathin Ungku
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Around $150 millions' worth of oil was stolen from Shell's biggest global refinery over several years, Singapore court documents reviewed by Reuters show, far more than reported when police first revealed the heist earlier this year. 
Almost a year on from raids that led to over a dozen arrests, including of several former employees of the local unit of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), charge sheets state that around 340,000 tonnes of gasoil were stolen from the oil major's Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014. 
Charges filed in the first few months of investigations after police raids in January related to the theft of around $10 million in oil. Further charges levied in May showed a total of $40 million had been stolen. 
A spokeswoman for Shell said the firm is ""disappointed"", adding that it has been working with investigators and taken measures to avoid repeat incidents at the Pulau Bukom facility, which lies just south of Singapore's main island. 
""These include closer monitoring of products moving in and out of Bukom, tightening vessel management procedures, and stepping up ethics and compliance training,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday. 
Southeast Asia is a hot spot for illegal fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell's refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - stand out. 
""Fuel is both ubiquitous and untraceable, making its theft a seemingly low-risk criminal operation compared to something like drug smuggling or arms trafficking, where the concern about being caught is much higher,"" said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the U.N. and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council. 
""That false sense of security leads to some fairly brazen forms of theft."" 
Fuel theft could be worth $133 billion a year globally, according to industry estimates, although Ralby said that figure might be conservative. 
CASE DRAGS
The case in Singapore looks like it could drag on, given the routine addition of new charges and amendments to older charges. The police investigation is still ongoing. 
""We are at the stage that the charges are still being rearranged ... it's quite far from final sentencing,"" said Ho Lifen, a lawyer at Rajah & Tann representing one of the accused former Shell employees, Cai Zhi Zhong. 

Besides the former Shell employees, there have been related charges filed against former employees of one of Singapore's biggest marine fuel suppliers, Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and three Vietnamese nationals who allegedly received stolen property aboard ships.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Jet Airways' survival may rest on founder Goyal leaving the cockpit,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jet Airways Ltd's (NS:JET) 69-year-old founder Naresh Goyal, who started out as an assistant in a travel agency, wove together charm, persistence and consummate dealmaking to build India's biggest full-service carrier.
Now, his penchant for control has emerged as a major obstacle as the indebted airline tries to negotiate a rescue deal, several people who have worked closely with him or known him over the years told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""He was a visionary in his day but those days are behind us,"" said a senior aircraft financier who has done deals with Goyal. ""This is the moment of truth for Naresh Goyal.""
The rising dominance of low-cost carrier IndiGo (NS:INGL) in a price sensitive market as well as high oil prices, hefty fuel taxes and a weak rupee have left Jet strapped for cash and unable to pay employees and lessors on time.
The 25-year-old airline, which Goyal set up with his wife at a time when state-run Air India was the only real formidable opponent, has outstanding dues of about $400 million.
Jet, which has a mainly  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fleet, has delayed pre-delivery payments to the Seattle-based aircraft maker as well as to Airbus SE (PA:AIR), and is overdue on its repair and maintenance contracts, two sources aware of the matter said.
Although the Indian air travel market is the world's fastest growing, at about 20 percent a year, it is also hobbled by cut-throat competition and chronically low fares. To stay afloat, Jet is cutting flights on some non-profitable routes and trying to raise cash by monetizing assets.
It still retains a valuable strategic position as the biggest operator at Mumbai airport, where all of the good slots have been taken and a second airport is years away. It also has lucrative slots at major international airports and code share agreements with more than 20 airlines. 
Jet has survived a near-death experience once before; in 2013, Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways injected $600 million of capital for a 24 percent stake in the airline, three London Heathrow slots and a majority share in Jet's frequent flyer program. The infusion helped Jet pare down debt and fight growing domestic competition.
The airline is in talks with Etihad a second time and with Indian conglomerate Tata Sons for fresh funds or a stake sale, but sources have told Reuters that any rescue would require Goyal to step down, or take a less prominent role.
Goyal has rejected seeking funds from Tata if it meant him having to give up his position, two sources aware of the discussions said. Talks with Etihad are continuing.
Goyal did not directly respond to requests for comment but a Jet spokeswoman said the ""conjectures being implied with regards to the organization's ways of working"" were misleading.
""The airline management is a fully empowered team ... all strategic, operational and tactical decisions are taken by the management under the advice of the company's board of directors,"" she said.
UNFORGIVING BUSINESS
Will Horton, an independent aviation analyst based in Hong Kong, said it was time for Jet to evolve beyond ""one leader or family"".
""A change at the top runs its course down. Freedom to implement a new management plan is critical for strategic and financial partners, existing and potentially new,"" he said.
When Goyal launched Jet Airways in 1993, air travel in India was at a nascent stage. He kickstarted the sector's growth and put the country on the map.
With 124 planes, Jet now flies to places like Hong Kong, Dubai, Paris and London, besides over 45 destinations in India.
Ceding control may not be easy for Goyal. He is Jet's chairman and holds a 51 percent stake in the airline with his wife Anita still on the board.
""It is a very mom-and-pop kind of operation where nothing happens without the two of them,"" said a former Jet employee, who describes the founder as a workaholic.
Goyal is always involved in key decisions and the airline's CEOs often have little executive power and do not survive for long, according to two other current and former employees.
Jet has had seven CEOs in 10 years with its current chief Vinay Dube taking over in August 2017.
""The airline is his life and he built it from nothing, you have to give him respect for that,"" said one of the former employees. ""But ... the airline business can be unforgiving.""
In 2012,  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines, founded by Indian businessman Vijay Mallya, went bust for want of cash, leaving its lessors and creditors with pending dues.
After Kingfisher went down, India ratified the Cape Town convention, an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments. That means Jet's lessors could choose to reclaim planes in case of a default. 
The airline could also be dragged to court by its creditors under India's new insolvency laws.
LIMITED OPTIONS
Jet is committed to turning around its business and creating ""a competitive cost structure that ensures a sustainable future for the airline and its stakeholders"", the spokeswoman said. 
She did not comment on any specific deals but said the airline continues to be in active discussions with various investors to secure ""sustainable financing"".
But Jet's rescue options appear somewhat limited given its poor financial position - it posted losses in the last three quarters and its shares have fallen about 70 percent so far this year, erasing more than $900 million in market value.
Goyal, is knocking on all doors, including that of the government. Jet and Etihad executives also met lenders in India to discuss a rescue deal.
Senior Etihad adviser and former Jet CEO Cramer Ball was in Mumbai last week, just days ahead of a meeting of the Abu Dhabi carrier's board on Dec. 7 where it was expected to discuss its investment in the Indian airline, two sources said. The outcome of the closed-door meeting remains unknown.
Etihad, in an e-mail to Reuters, said it would not comment on speculation.
However, the Abu Dhabi carrier, which owns 24 percent of Jet, is ready to put in more money only if Goyal dilutes his stake, a source aware of the matter told Reuters. 
Even so, Etihad's stake will be capped at 49 percent due to foreign ownership rules in Indian airlines and if it goes past the 25 percent ownership threshold, it would need to adhere to capital markets regulations and make an open offer to shareholders to buy a further 26 percent stake. 
If forced to do this, Etihad would risk breaching the foreign ownership restrictions and so it may have to seek a rare exemption from the markets regulator from making an open offer.
Talks with Tata are on the backburner for now but three people familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said they may be found waiting in the wings if the Etihad deal falls through.

""There is an expectation that there will be a rescue and Goyal will find a way - he always does - but there is no clarity on how much control he will have after a deal is done,"" said one of the people who works with him.

FRANKFURT/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Indian car wiring maker  Motherson Sumi Systems  Ltd (NS:MOSS) is in early talks with German peer  Leoni AG  (DE:LEOGn) over a possible merger of the pair, two people close to the matter said. 
The car industry and its suppliers, facing a regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions and a slump in China, have issued a slew of profit warnings in recent months and companies are shaking up their businesses in order to adapt.
Motherson Sumi has snapped up a number of companies in recent years, adding to its range of automotive interior products including rearview mirrors, wiring harnesses and rubber and plastic components.
The company, a joint venture between India's Samvardhana Motherson Group and Japan's Sumitomo Wiring Systems (T:5802), has been scouting for a sizeable acquisition target in Europe with the help of an investment bank.
Any deal with Leoni could be worth more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) but financing still needs to be worked out, one of the people said. The exact deal structure was still unclear, and deliberations may not succeed, the sources added.
An acquisition of Leoni would add to Motherson Sumi's 180 facilities across 37 countries and bolster overseas sales.
Motherson Sumi, which counts several global automakers including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), as clients, informed the Indian stock exchange on Friday that it keeps ""examining and evaluating"" business opportunities globally and it would make necessary disclosures when needed. 
Leoni declined to comment. 
Shares in Leoni, which has a market cap of $7.1 billion, ended up 18 percent on Thursday in their biggest one-day gain in nearly a decade. The stock has slumped more than 50 percent this year as demand stagnated, with Leoni citing rising global trade tensions and stricter emissions rules for slowing business.
Shares in Motherson Sumi rose as much as 10.8 percent on Friday, and was trading up 2.3 percent by 0844 GMT.
Motherson Sumi most recently acquired Reydel Automotive, which manufactures door panels and cockpit modules, for about $200 million to help meet its target of not having any component, customer or country contribute more than 15 percent to its business by 2020.
Parent company Samvardhana Motherson is one of the world's fastest growing specialized automotive component manufacturers, recording a turnover of $10.5 billion in fiscal 2017/18, according to Motherson Sumi's latest annual report. 
Cable and wiring system specialist Leoni brought in Aldo Kamper as its chief executive in September. After cutting its 2018 targets, the company is undertaking a comprehensive restructuring program.
Analysts at Berenberg said in August that although Leoni had a large order backlog, it needed to improve its cost structure, with additional expenses likely to hurt 2019 earnings.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has promoted 85 executives in the international division that houses its investment bank to the rank of managing director, the British lender said on Friday.
The promotions represent an increase from the 74 elevated last year and 60 in 2016. However, a spokesman for the bank said the net increase in managing directors could be smaller than those figures implied as some executives have also left.
The promotions come as Barclays' investment bank is under scrutiny by investors, amid pressure by activist investor Edward Bramson who sees paring back the trading business as the way to generate better returns for Barclays overall.
Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley has repeatedly rebuffed that notion, saying the investment bank is an important part of Barclays' strategy that provides a counterbalance as trading revenues rise in turbulent times that hurt other parts of the business.
The managing director role is one of the most prestigious in investment banking. Below the chief executive level, most global investment banks are run by just a few hundred 'MDs', from whose ranks the next leader of the bank is typically chosen.
A typical salary for a managing director at Barclays is about 300,000 pounds ($377,520) according to recruitment website Glassdoor.
Of the newly promoted managing directors, 27 percent are women, a spokesman said, up from 23 percent last year and 18 percent in 2016. Barclays said in February it had a mean gender pay gap in its international division of 48 percent, among the highest differentials in financial firms globally.
It means the average hourly wage for a woman was just under half that of a man, with the difference generally caused by fewer women attaining senior ranks such as managing director rather than by women being paid less than men of the same rank.

Germany's DAX, which is particularly sensitive to global trade tensions and the Chinese economy, was the biggest faller amid pressure on retailers, banks and carmakers.  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) was down 2.5 percent, among the biggest fallers. 
Investors shunned equities after data showed China's November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as domestic demand softened further.
The world's second-largest economy has been losing momentum in recent quarters as a multi-year government campaign to curb shadow lending put increasing financial strains on companies in a blow to production and investment.
The data dented European retailers and luxury goods companies which make a significant portion of their revenue in China. 
The sector was also in focus after Hennessey, Moet and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) announced plans to buy luxury hotel group Belmond (N:BEL) in a deal worth $3.2 billion. The shares were down 1.7 percent.
M&A dominated the headlines in general. German online classifieds company Scout24 (DE:G24n) soared 16 percent after the FT reported it's exploring a sale that could see it taken private in one of the country's largest leveraged buyouts in years.
GVC Holdings (L:GVC) hit the jackpot ahead of a UK parliamentary vote on legislation next week that Citi analysts say will remove a risk of a major cash outlay to former  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) shareholders.

Mhun, 56, is currently senior vice-president of services at Airbus - a fiercely competitive marketplace in which both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are targeting increases in revenue as they place after-market activities at the center of future developments.
He began his career in engineering at the now defunct French airline UTA and followed it into Air France when UTA was absorbed into the French national carrier in the early 1990s.
In July, Mhun confirmed plans for Airbus to triple revenue from commercial aircraft services - such as spare parts and predictive maintenance data - to $10 billion in the next decade.
Boeing has said its possible next development, a mid-market jet carrying 220-260 passengers, will allow it to speed up the introduction of digital design methods so that future services revenues are factored in from the earliest planning stage.
Sources said Mhun's appointment will bring a customer perspective and an after-market emphasis to Airbus, which is also investing in digital tools to draw more business from the full life cycle of a jet, from design to retirement.
""It means that services will be driven deeply into programs,"" a person familiar with the company said.
Evrard is credited with the execution of two of Europe's most ambitious aerospace projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, with relatively few delays compared to past programs such as the A380 superjumbo.

He had been due to retire earlier in 2018 but agreed to stay until year end, along with Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams, in order to tackle recent industrial and supplier problems.

The German group is undergoing one of its largest ever restructuring processes via a planned spin-off of its capital goods businesses, capping a tumultuous summer that led the group's CEO and chairman to resign.
Dietsch was CFO at Bayer from October 2014 to May 2018, where he arranged funding for the $63 billion all-cash takeover of U.S. seeds maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), including bond issues and a capital increase.
He also oversaw the separate listing and gradual sale of Bayer's chemicals and plastics division Covestro (DE:1COV), now worth 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion).
""He brings exactly the skills and experience needed to manage the separation process at Thyssenkrupp together with the current members of the Board,"" Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Chairman Bernhard Pellens said in a statement.
Dietsch, 56, will start his new job in February 2019, pending approval from the supervisory board. 
He brings the number of management board members back to four. Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Thyssenkrupp's permanent CEO in September, previously held the position of finance chief.

Growth in Retail sales and industrial output in China slowed more than expected in November, official data showed on Friday.
Retail sales grew 8.1% year on year, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, compared with the median forecast of 8.8%. The growth was the weakest pace since 2003, according to Reuters’ records.
Meanwhile, growth in industrial output also dipped half a percentage point to notch a year-on-year rise of 5.4%, lower than the 5.9% that markets projected.
On the other hand, fixed-asset investment grew 5.9% from January to November, marginally higher than the previous expected 5.8%.
Despite the weak data, China's statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong said China is on track to hit its 2018 GDP growth target of around 6.5%, although the economy would be facing more external uncertainties in 2019.
Weaker industrial output and retail sales growth in November showed that downward pressure on the economy is increasing, he added.
Meanwhile, although not a directional driver, Bloomberg reported that the White House would later in the day officially announce a delay in tariff hike on Chinese imported goods.
The report came after China promised to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. automobiles and postpone some targets of its ambitious plans to dominate high-end technologies, the “Made in China 2025” plan, by 10 years.
“They’ve started to make some very early stage, very preliminary, but very welcome moves,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.

SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues.
Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week ""to address any possible concern about our compliance with the order"", the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Earlier this week, Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would likely take time to enforce.
""Based on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,"" Apple said.
""Early next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.""
The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple's business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.
Qualcomm has said the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.
Apple has filed a request for reconsideration with the court, a copy of which Qualcomm shared with Reuters. 
WHERE'S THE HARM?
Qualcomm and Apple disagree about whether the court order means iPhone sales must be halted. 
The court's preliminary injunction, which the chipmaker also shared with Reuters, orders an immediate block, though lawyers say Apple could take steps to stall the process.
All iPhone models were available for purchase on Apple's China website on Friday.
Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case against Apple in China in late 2017, saying the iPhone maker infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.
Apple argues the injunction should be lifted as continuing to sell iPhones does not constitute ""irreparable harm"" to Qualcomm, a key consideration for a preliminary injunction, the copy of its reconsideration request dated Dec. 10 shows.
""That's one of the reasons why in a very complicated patent litigation case the judge would be reluctant to grant a preliminary injunction,"" said Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels.
HIT LOCAL SUPPLIERS
Apple's reconsideration request also says any ban on iPhone sales would impact its Chinese suppliers and consumers as well as the tax revenue it pays to authorities.
The request adds the injunction could force Apple to settle with Qualcomm. But it was not clear whether this referred to the latest case or their broader legal dispute.
Qualcomm has paid a 300 million yuan ($43.54 million) bond to cover potential damages to Apple from a sales ban and Apple is willing to pay a ""counter security"" of double that to get the ban lifted, the copy of the reconsideration request shows.
Apple did not immediately respond to questions about the reconsideration request and Reuters was not independently able to confirm its authenticity.
Lawyer Li said the case would undoubtedly ramp up pressure on Apple, especially if a ban was enforced.

""I think that Qualcomm and Apple, they always have those IP litigations to try to force the other side to make concessions. They try to get their inch somewhere. That's always the game.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's board is unlikely to select a chairman to succeed Carlos Ghosn as had been expected on Dec. 17 after a panel tasked to choose a candidate did not agree on a nominee in a meeting held Thursday, a source said.
The panel of Nissan's three external directors agreed on Thursday that more time was needed to decide on a candidate, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. 
One of the sources said the external directors were likely to continue their discussions over the weekend but were not expected to recommend a candidate at Monday's board meeting.
The directors agreed on Thursday that they would focus on setting up a third-party committee to make recommendations on improving Nissan's governance, the source said.
The directors ""won't rush to make a decision (on the chairman) before the board meeting,"" the source said, adding that a candidate may be decided in January. 
The sources requested anonymity because the matter was confidential. 
Ghosn has been held in a Tokyo jail since he was arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of conspiring to understate his pay by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million) awarded over five years from 2010. He was charged on Monday.

He was also re-arrested on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018, with the Tokyo District Court extending his detention until Dec. 20.

125,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",Apple Says China iPhone Ban Would Force Settlement With Qualcomm,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). says a Chinese ban on sales of the iPhone will force it to settle a long and bitter licensing battle with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc., an outcome that may end up harming the country’s smartphone industry and consumers around the world.
The U.S. company was responding to a Chinese court that ruled this week Apple infringed two Qualcomm patents and issued injunctions against the sale of six older versions of the iPhone. Apple, which has filed a request for consideration, argues the decision harms China’s interests by potentially raising the royalties and fees that phonemakers pay Qualcomm.
The ruling from a local court -- which came as Washington and Beijing are locked in sensitive trade negotiations -- pivoted the battle over patent fees to the world’s largest mobile arena. Apple’s response underscores the importance of the Chinese market, as well as Qualcomm’s crucial role as a technology provider to the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp.
“Apple will be forced to settle with the Respondent, causing all mobile phone manufacturers to relapse into the previous unreasonable charging mode and pay high licensing fees, resulting in unrecoverable losses in the downstream market of mobile phones,” the iPhone maker said in the Dec. 10 filing to the court. The document was submitted in Mandarin with an English translation that Bloomberg verified. Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The two U.S. companies are locked in a worldwide dispute over licensing fees that Qualcomm charges for use of technology that the chipmaker says underpins all modern phone systems. Apple has argued its former supplier unfairly leverages its position as the biggest supplier of chips for smartphones to force payment. Qualcomm has countered that Apple is using its intellectual property without paying for it, and the legal cases are aimed at forcing it to lower licensing charges.
Like Apple, Chinese smartphone makers had argued for years that Qualcomm -- which owns a swathe of patents essential to modern wireless communications -- is abusing its position and levying punitive fees. Most have since struck an agreement with the U.S. company. Qualcomm successfully argued to the Chinese government its intellectual property coverage would protect those handset makers, allowing them to penetrate overseas markets.
Now, Apple is saying China’s latest ruling could influence a broader global conflict. While iPhones remain on store shelves pending a decision on Apple’s appeal, a negative outcome could affect its sales in the world’s biggest market for smartphones, where the company generates about a fifth of its revenue. And it will come at a time when demand for Apple’s most important product is slowing.
“This legal response back to the Chinese courts highlights the potential seriousness of this ruling for Apple. It’s all a game of high-stakes poker and Apple is going to fight this Qualcomm case with an iron fist,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. “A settlement would be the last resort but losing this appeal would be another gut punch for Apple and potentially force their hand.”
China is also the production base for most iPhones as well as the iPad and Mac. Apple warned that the ban would hurt manufacturers like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. -- known also as Foxconn -- and other suppliers. A ban would cost Apple millions of dollars a day and affect both the Chinese government and consumers, the company added, noting it has created 5 million jobs across the country’s supply chain and third-party software developers.
“Apple and many other companies, consumers, and government will suffer truly irreparable harm,” the company said in the filing. The Chinese government “may suffer hundreds of thousands of tax losses” from the iPhone ban because of lost taxes from sales of the devices, it said, citing estimates of 50 million units sold in the country in 2017.
Qualcomm has also brought patent suits in China and other jurisdictions, seeking bans on the sale of iPhones to force Apple to the negotiating table.
In addition to the Chinese case, it’s filed complaints against Apple in Munich and Mannheim, Germany, and lodged another one with the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington. All three venues offer it the chance -- if successful -- to shut down or limit the sale of the iPhone, a product that generates the majority of Apple’s revenue.
“This is what Qualcomm needed to get some leverage to try to get Apple to finalize a deal,” said Mike Walkley at Canaccord Genuity LLC.

Citing two people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said a notice in the Federal Register is expected to be published later in the day.
The tariff increase was initially planned for Jan. 1.
The report came after China promised to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. automobiles and postpone some targets of its ambitious plans to dominate high-end technologies, the “Made in China 2025” plan, by 10 years.
“They’ve started to make some very early stage, very preliminary, but very welcome moves,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.
However, the reports failed to lift sentiment, as the Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component fell 0.6% and 0.8% respectively by 9:10 PM ET (02:10 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.5%.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.8% even after a preliminary survey compiled by IHS Markit showed the country’s manufacturing activity expanded in December.
The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 52.4 in December, compared with 52.2 in November, the survey showed on Friday.
Separately, the Bank of Japan released the Tankan survey on Friday that showed large Japanese manufacturers’ sentiment stood at plus 19 in December, unchanged from three months ago and beating a median market forecast of plus 17.
The index for non-manufacturers rose to plus 24, exceeding the general consensus of plus 21.
The Tankan survey “is a better indication of the underlying strength of the Japanese economy than the prior GDP figures,” said Robert Carnell, ING’s chief economist and head of research in the Asia Pacific.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) screen supplier  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) jumped as much as 40% in morning trade on reports that the company is in discussion with Chinese businesses and investment funds to get support for its turnaround efforts.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI traded 1.3% lower, while Australia’s ASX 200 was also down 0.9%."

The information involved how stations were performing, which provides insight to rivals about whether they would raise, lower or maintain spot advertising prices, the agency said in a statement.
The settlement, which must be approved by a court, bars direct and indirect sharing of such information and requires Nexstar to cooperate in the ongoing investigation, the statement said.
""Robust competition among broadcast stations allows American businesses to obtain competitive advertising rates. The unlawful sharing of information reduced that competition and harmed businesses and the consumers they serve,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney General Makan Delrahim said. 
Nexstar, which owns or operates 105 television stations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In November, the Justice Department announced it had settled similar antitrust charges with Sinclair Broadcast Group (O:SBGI),  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO), Raycom Media Inc,  Meredith Corp  (N:MDP), Griffin Communications and Dreamcatcher Broadcasting LLC.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Record cash streamed out of U.S.-based stock funds and billions more fled bonds in a week of apparently escalated caution, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
More than $46 billion thundered out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the most ever, while a near-record $13 billion poured from bonds, according to the research service. Relatively low-risk money market funds pulled in $81 billion, also the most recorded, the research service's data showed.
The withdrawals appeared to show investor confidence cracking in the waning days of a wild year of up-and-down trading that has left many people with losses across both stock and bond funds, a rare occurrence.
The end-of-year numbers could also reflect changes related to capital gains distributions and as investors re-evaluate their holdings for tax reasons and other purposes, though in other years the volume has not been this high in a single week.
U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes, high corporate borrowing, rising relative yields on short-term bonds, U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing growth in corporate profits have left investors with much to stew over. The average U.S.-based equity fund is down 6.3 percent in the year through Dec. 11, while its bond counterpart is down 0.9 percent, Lipper said.
More than $45 billion of the withdrawals came from equity mutual funds, heavily used by retail investors during the week. Lipper measures a week as the seven-day period from Thursday to Wednesday, and much of its records date back to 1992.
Individual investors are the most pessimistic about stock performance they have been in more than five years, with 49 percent expecting the market to fall in the next six months, according to a widely-followed survey by the American Association of Individual Investors covering the latest week.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: France plans Renault CEO hunt as board frays over Ghosn - sources,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - The French government is seeking candidates to replace Renault's (PA:RENA) embattled boss Carlos Ghosn, sources told Reuters, as board members began to voice doubts about keeping him in office following his indictment in Japan for suspected misconduct.
At a meeting on Thursday,  Renault  directors were briefed on an investigation by alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) that led to Ghosn's arrest last month. He was charged this week over the company's failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive.
Nissan fired Ghosn as chairman three days after his detention, but Renault has resisted pressure to dismiss him, as the scandal strains their carmaking alliance.
The Renault board on Thursday stuck by its earlier decision to keep him on, with its lead director standing in as interim chairman and deputy CEO Thierry Bollore leading operations.
In a statement issued by Renault after the meeting, the board ""noted that, at this stage, it does not have information concerning Carlos Ghosn's defense.""
During the five-hour session, however, several directors led by Cherie Blair, wife of the British former prime minister Tony Blair, began to express impatience with that position, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
""What she said, in effect, was that we can't remain in this situation forever,"" one source said of Blair. ""At some point you need to move forward and move on.""
A Renault spokesman said he could not comment on board proceedings. Cherie Blair could not immediately be reached for comment.
SHORTLIST
French officials have already begun listing possible candidates to replace Ghosn as CEO, three sources close to the company said. Senior Toyota executive Didier Leroy will be considered, one said.
""There's nothing official yet but the government is working on a lineup,"" he said. ""They're ready to turn the page.""
A finance ministry official declined to comment. The government, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake and two board seats, typically plays a major role in succession planning.
""I have no comment on speculation, and I am 100 percent concentrated on my job at Toyota,"" Leroy told Reuters.
The boardroom crisis has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken the French parent's control.
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding.
Blair's board intervention was echoed during the meeting by two other independent directors as well as Renault staff representatives, two sources said - with some also voicing misgivings over management's handling of the crisis.
BOARD COUNSEL
At the risk of worsening tensions, Bollore instructed Nissan to refrain from contacting Renault directors ahead of the meeting, Reuters reported on Tuesday, as the Japanese carmaker sought to share its findings.
Directors had also clashed with Renault managers over their right to hire independent board counsel with access to Nissan's findings, two other people said. 
Company attorneys answering to Mouna Sepehri - who doubles as board secretary and head of Ghosn's CEO office - have so far declined to share the report with directors or their lawyers, citing the secrecy of the investigation.
Under French government pressure, Ghosn had been exploring a deeper tie-up or even a full merger between the alliance partners, despite strong reservations at Nissan.
Whether or not they broke the law, Ghosn's undisclosed compensation plans - doubling his total Nissan package for the five years to March 2015 - are politically sensitive in France, where President Emmanuel Macron has been battling protests.
Defence arguments advanced by Ghosn's lawyers and supporters have not contested the plans' existence. His Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru said in a media statement that the pay agreements had not been properly ratified.
Nissan has said its whistleblower investigation also uncovered personal use of company funds and other misconduct, detailed in the report shared with Renault lawyers this week.
Renault, which launched an audit into its own payments to Ghosn after his arrest, said on Thursday its ""preliminary conclusion"" was that his compensation had been ""in compliance with applicable law"" and governance guidelines.

Ghosn and an alleged accomplice, Nissan director Greg Kelly, remain in custody and have had limited opportunity to respond to the allegations or defend themselves, particularly in public.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>","Costco margin dip overshadows sales beat, shares slide","(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp's (O:COST) gross margins fell in the first quarter, as the warehouse operator paid higher wages, ramped up investments in its online business and cut prices amid intense competition in the grocery industry.
Costco shares, which have gained 21.7 percent this year, were down 3.2 percent at $219.13 in extended trading on Thursday.
Higher gas prices also pressured gross margins, leading to a 50 basis points drop to 10.75 percent in the first quarter ended Nov. 25. Excluding gas, margins fell 26 basis points.
Costco, which sells everything from personal computers to groceries, has been adding more organic and fresh food products as it takes on Walmart's (N:WMT) Sam's Club, which after shutting some stores last year has amped up competition.
""We've seen a little bit more margin pressure as there's been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam's as well,"" Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said, referring to its grocery business.
Costco also raised hourly minimum wages for about 130,000 store employees by $1 to between $14 and $14.50 in June, as it becomes harder to find workers in a tight job market. 
The wage increase in part drove overall, selling, general and administrative expenses up 11 percent.
Still, total revenue rose 10.2 percent to $35.07 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $34.80, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales at established stores, excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes, rose 7.5 percent, well above estimates of 5.8 percent.
""Costco's Q1 results reflect the company's prudent strategy of short-term investments for long-term benefit,"" said Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. 

Net income attributable to the company rose to $767 million, or $1.73 per share, from $640 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 06:41PM ET</span>",Evidence of Apple switch ruled inadmissible in Qualcomm antitrust case,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ruled that evidence provided by chip supplier  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) that major phone makers like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) have moved to competing suppliers like  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) cannot be used to fight allegations Qualcomm acted to preserve a monopoly on some mobile phone chips.
The Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Qualcomm's patent licensing and chip sale practices were anticompetitive and sought to preserve a monopoly on so-called premium LTE modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data network.
At the hearing in San Jose, California, an attorney for the FTC said there are ""still discussions going on"" with Qualcomm about settling the case, but a Qualcomm attorney said there was ""no news"" about the status of the talks. The two sides disclosed they were in talks in October.
The case, which began in 2017, is headed to trial in January, but the cutoff for the two sides to gather evidence ended in March. 
Since March, Qualcomm has disclosed that Apple completely stopped using its modems in its newest iPhones and switched to chips from Intel Corp. Qualcomm has also broadened its use of a lower-cost licensing model for technology for the next generation of mobile data networks, with several phone makers already signing the deals.
Qualcomm argued in court papers that the new market conditions would likely show that it does not have the monopoly on modem chips that the FTC alleges. 
But Judge Lucy Koh rejected the request in a pre-trial decision, saying that the case was about Qualcomm's business conduct and not its market power.
""Qualcomm does not argue that any post-discovery evidence shows a change in Qualcomm’s own business conduct. All of the proposed evidence relates to alleged shifts in Qualcomm’s market power,"" Koh wrote in her decision.
The decision is the second pre-trial blow Judge Koh has dealt to Qualcomm. Last month, she ruled that Qualcomm must grant patent licenses to its technology to rival chipmakers if they request it.
If the FTC wins its case against Qualcomm, regulators could impose fines and force the company to change some of its business practices around patent licensing, which drive more of the chip supplier's profits than chip sales.
Regulators in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere have reached decisions against Qualcomm and imposed billions of dollars in fines.

However, Qualcomm has appealed many of the decisions and settled some of them, for example by agreeing with Taiwanese regulators to invest $700 million in that country's technology sector.

The proposal does not request funding for potential lawsuits or claims resulting from the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires, the company said in a filing.
The utility faces regulatory curbs on how much it can charge consumers, restricting its ability to make up for losses through rate hikes.
PG&E had previously forecast a 2019 electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.96 billion, up 9.5 percent from 2018.
While the exact extent of PG&E's fire-related liabilities remains unclear, the company had previously said its liability could exceed its insurance coverage if its electrical equipment was found to have caused the Camp Fire. 
The blaze swept through the town of Paradise and killed 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history.

The company also said its estimated undiscounted cost to decommission its nuclear power plants rose by about $700 million due to potential costs related to waste disposal, program oversight and site infrastructure.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The battle between Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and its ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn in Brazil's courts escalated on Thursday after the Japanese carmaker sued his sister alleging ""unjust enrichment"" and his lawyers alleged Nissan could have planted evidence.
In the afternoon, Nissan faced a setback in its battle to secure the contents of a beachfront apartment in Rio that Ghosn used when he ran the company and which it says may contain evidence of wrongdoing. An appellate judge ruled that Ghosn or his daughter must be allowed into the apartment for 24 hours to retrieve personal belongings.
Brazilian-born Ghosn was arrested last month and indicted this week in Japan for allegedly underreporting his income. Nissan also alleges he diverted company funds to pay for personal expenses. He has been held in a Japanese court since his arrest.
The Rio apartment has become the center of a side battle to the case being fought in Japan. Nissan says it has found three safes there that could contain evidence of Ghosn's alleged crimes.
Ghosn and his daughter, however, have sued to retrieve what they say are personal items, such as ""photographs, jewelry, watches and books.""
In court papers, lawyers for Ghosn said that since Nissan had entered the apartment after his arrest, the automaker could have ""inserted objects or documents that could compromise his good reputation.""
A representative for Nissan in Brazil declined to comment. A Ghosn family representative had no comment on the ""unjust enrichment"" lawsuit and did not respond to a request for comment on the apartment decision.
Additional details regarding the unjust enrichment lawsuit were not immediately available and it was unclear how long it might take to resolve the case.
The Japanese press had already reported that Ghosn's elder sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, could be embroiled in the scandal. 
Nissan's internal investigation found that Ghosn had instructed the company since 2002 to pay about $100,000 a year to his sister, according to a November report by the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily by circulation, that cited unnamed sources. The compensation was supposed to be for a role as an adviser.

The paper added that Bichara de Oliveira had in fact been living in and managing the Rio apartment that Nissan had bought for the use of Ghosn and that she had done no advisory work for the carmaker.

Retailers have been struggling lately, with the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF down about 17% in the last three months.
Tomorrow’s retail sales figures will give investors insight into how businesses fared in November, which includes Black Friday but not the following weekend and Cyber Monday.
The Commerce Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:50 GMT).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29% to 24,597, below its session high of 24,740. The S&P 500 fell 0.02%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.39%.
Positive sentiment on trade faded, pressuring the broader market, even as a Chinese ministry spokesman touted progress on U.S.-China talks and reportedly said any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome.
The positive sound bite from Beijing on trade comes a day after reports that China could revamp its economic plans to give foreign companies more access to its domestic market.
Defensive corners of the market like consumer staples, and utilities, were in favor, underscoring the weaker sentiment on risk.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) led consumer staples higher, rising more than 2% after being upgraded to buy from neutral at Merrill Lynch.
Beyond trade, the broader market was hurt by ongoing weakness in financials as bank stocks continued to fall ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week, when the central bank is expected to rein in its outlook on rate hikes.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) ended the day in the red.
Energy, meanwhile, supported the broader market on the back of rise in oil prices on signs tightening crude supply following reports of falling stockpiles at a key delivery hub in Oklahoma.
Losses in industrials, meanwhile, were limited by a rally in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) after a long-time critic JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) upgraded its outlook on the conglomerate, citing an improved balance sheet.
General Electric also announced it will launch a new Industrial Internet of Things software company, which would operate as a wholly-owned and independently-run GE business with $1.2 billion in annual software revenue.
In corporate earnings, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), after the close Thursday, reported earnings that missed on both the top and bottom lines. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares fell in after-hours as the coffee chain's subdued outlook on longer-term growth offset above-forecast earnings.
In political news, meanwhile, federal prosecutors reportedly launched a probe into whether President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration misspent funds it raised and also whether donors funded the campaign in exchanged for access to the incoming Trump administration as well as “policy concessions or to influence official administration positions,” The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>",Trump says GM shift to electric vehicles is 'not going to work',"By David Shepardson and Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday said General Motors Co's (N:GM) decision to shift much of its focus to electric vehicles will not succeed, and he asserted a new trade deal will make it harder for the company to move work to other countries.
GM last year said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023 as it faces rising regulatory requirements for zero-emission vehicles in China and elsewhere.
The largest U.S. automaker has come under enormous criticism in Washington after it announced on Nov. 26 plans to close four plants in the United States and cut up to 15,000 jobs in North America.
Trump questioned GM CEO Mary Barra's business strategy in an interview with Fox News.
""They've changed the whole model of General Motors. They've gone to all-electric. All-electric is not going to work ... It's wonderful to have it as a percentage of your cars, but going into this model that she's doing I think is a mistake,"" Trump said.
Barra was on Capitol Hill for two days of meetings last week to discuss the company's decision with angry lawmakers from states where plants are closing. ""To tell me a couple weeks before Christmas that's she going to close in Ohio and Michigan - not acceptable to me,"" Trump said.
Trump has repeatedly said GM should reverse a decision to close an assembly plant in northeast Ohio, an area potentially crucial in the 2020 presidential election. ""Ohio is going to replace those jobs in like two minutes,"" Trump said. ""She's either going to open fast or somebody else is going to go in.""
GM shares fell 1.4 percent in trading Thursday.
Asked to respond, GM said it timed its job cut announcement so employees could accept open jobs at other plants.
""We continue to produce great vehicles today for our customers while taking steps toward our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,"" GM said.
Trump suggested that a new free trade deal with Mexico and Canada makes it ""very uncomfortable"" for GM to build cars outside the United States.
""I don't like that General Motors does that... General Motors is not going to be treated well,"" he said without elaborating. 
Trump signed a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada on Nov. 30 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, but that deal has not been approved by the U.S. Congress. 
The deal boosts the North American content requirements for vehicles to be traded tariff free and requires a significant percentage of vehicles to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. 
Some Democrats argue the trade deal may need changes to deter GM and other automakers from continuing significant production in Mexico. GM is not backing off its plans to build the new Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico.

148,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Your Favorite Way to Play Volatility Will Be Gone Next Month,"(Bloomberg) -- The largest trading vehicle tracking the VIX is disappearing at the end of January. Were you aware?
VXX, which sees an average $1.5 billion of activity every day, will mature on Jan. 30, 2019, in accordance with its rules. As an exchange-traded note -- its full name is the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN -- VXX is a debt obligation with a fixed lifespan, unlike an exchange-traded fund, which is a portfolio of assets that behaves like an ordinary stock. Anyone who holds the ETN to maturity will receive a cash payout equal to its value.
For now, investors seem unperturbed. As stocks have slumped, bounced, and slumped again, volatility has soared and the doomed note has seen even more activity than usual. The $833 million product, which offers exposure to futures contracts on the Cboe Volatility Index, is often one of the 10 most traded ETPs of the day. Meanwhile, the replacement ETN is one-fifth its size and has 0.1 percent of its volume. That’s a huge difference in liquidity.
“Many traders probably don’t know it is maturing, and the ones that do are just too addicted to VXX’s oceanic liquidity to leave,” said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “This is likely to be a messier and slower move than people assume because you can’t transfer liquidity the same way you can transfer assets.”
Despite accounting for less than 1 percent of the broader $3.5 trillion ETP market, ETNs came sharply into focus earlier this year, when a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG note known by its ticker XIV that bet on low volatility lost 90 percent of its value and was abruptly terminated.
Structure Confusion
ETNs often offer exposure that can’t easily be packaged into a fund. But their structure can muddle investors more accustomed to using ETFs.
It’s a challenge that  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc -- VXX’s issuer -- understands all too well. Investors failed to budge when the bank retired or replaced half of its U.S. lineup in April. While some money has since left the products, more than $600 million remains in 32 notes that the bank delisted and are now harder to trade.
A spokeswoman from Barclays declined to comment.
Volatility fans could opt to buy futures directly until the replacement product’s liquidity grows, Bloomberg’s Balchunas wrote in a note earlier this year. They could also use one or more of the 10 other U.S. ETPs that wager on market turmoil.
However, interest in VXX’s replacement -- known by its ticker VXXB -- appears to be improving. Almost $100 million of trades took place on Dec. 3, a record for the note.
“VXX is very significant to the market,” Balchunas said. “But it’s not the end of the world for its fans since there’s an exact replica from the same issuer, in the same structure, ready to take its place.”

154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Instacart to close Whole Foods delivery operation next year,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Instacart said on Thursday it will stop delivering groceries for Whole Foods next year, ending a partnership that has been under stress since Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) acquired the upmarket grocer last year.
Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods rocked the U.S. grocery space in 2017 and the ecommerce giant has since steadily increased the speed of delivery throughout its system, including by expanding one-day and one-hour delivery.
""Amazon's intent from day one when it first announced its desire to acquire Whole Foods was to integrate Whole Foods with its own grocery-delivery efforts such as Amazon Fresh and Prime Now,"" Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson said. 
The delivery partnership with Whole Foods in 2014 made Instacart popular among young consumers who increasingly wanted milk and eggs delivered straight to their doorsteps. 
In 2016, the companies deepened their relationship, entering into an exclusive, five-year agreement to delivery perishables.
It is still not clear what, if any, penalties Amazon incurred for ending the partnership early. 
For Instacart, Whole Foods was among the more lucrative grocery client, given the relatively high-dollar purchases from its stores which made it a favorite for many delivery drivers of the startup. 
Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Instacart will find it difficult to recover from the separation as the delivery space becomes more crowded.
Instacart clients such as  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) both have started in-house delivery services.
Meanwhile, Instacart has sought to find more ways to earn revenue, building up a business of coupon sales and promotions sponsored by packaged-goods brands such as Nestle (S:NESN),  General Mills  (N:GIS), Coca-Cola (N:KO), which are displayed in the app and target consumers based on shopping habits.
It has also added about 100 retail partners this year. Reuters reported in November Instacart had raised $271 million from investors, including Tiger Global Management, bringing the company's valuation to $7.87 billion.
Instacart Chief Executive Officer Apoorva Mehta said on Thursday about 350 of its 1,415 part-time delivery employees at 76 Whole Foods locations will be laid off once the divorce begins in February 2019 and winds down in the following months. 

All other employees will be transferred to service other retailers, the company said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's biggest banks are tightening their grip over the country's C$1.5 trillion ($1.1 trillion) mortgage market as new rules designed to cut out risky lending make it harder for borrowers to switch lenders, with some analysts betting on more gains for the country's biggest two banks. 
The rules, which stress-test borrowers' ability to make repayments at 200 basis points above their contracted rates, had been expected to hurt profitability at the banks' domestic businesses by resulting in them turning away more customers.
However, the country's biggest five banks, which account for about two-thirds of the Canadian mortgage market, are reporting higher rates of renewals by existing customers concerned they will not qualify for a mortgage with another bank. 
The rules, known as B-20 and introduced in January, do not apply when borrowers are renewing mortgages with their current lender, creating an uneven playing field.
""B-20 has created higher renewal rates for the big banks, driving volumes and goosing their growth rates,"" said Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault. ""It's had the unintended consequence of reducing competition.""
Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) ( RBC ), the country's biggest lender, said last month that mortgage renewal rates ranged between 90 and 92 percent in the second half of its fiscal year compared with 87 to 88 percent before the new regulations were implemented.
RBC said that is due in part to the B-20 regulations and also to improvements it has made to make it easier for customers to renew.
FLAT INDUSTRY GROWTH
DBRS analyst Robert Colangelo said RBC and Toronto Dominion Bank (TO:TD) could exceed their targets for mortgage sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and 4 to 6 percent, respectively, next year, given the high retention rates. 
""We may see a bit of an uptick in mortgage growth above the guidance that the banks have provided,"" he said. ""Borrowers have tended to stay with their institutions and not go looking for a bank that might be offering a flashy rate.""
Ron Butler, owner of Toronto-based brokerage Butler Mortgage, said the changes leave borrowers with less choice.
""Even if they are up-to-date with their repayments, borrowers may find they don't qualify with other lenders so they're stuck with their bank at whatever rate it offers,"" he said.
Senior Canadian bankers such as RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay and TD's CEO, Bharat Masrani, voiced their support for the new rules prior to their introduction, saying rising prices were a threat to Canada's economy. [nL2N1MS0HE]
TD increased its residential mortgage book, including home equity loans, by 6.5 percent during its latest fiscal year to Oct. 31, while RBC expanded its book by 4 percent. The overall market grew by just 1 percent during that time. 
In contrast, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's  mortgage book, including home equity loans, was flat during the year. The bank has reined in lending after a period of aggressive growth, during which it expanded its team of mortgage advisers and outperformed the market.
While analysts say RBC and TD are expected to benefit from higher-than-normal retention rates in 2019, not everyone is sure borrowers will benefit.
""The banks are becoming more sophisticated in targeting borrowers who would fail the stress test and they can charge them higher rates at renewal knowing they can't move elsewhere,"" Butler said.

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig, who was detained in Beijing earlier this week, is a fluent Mandarin speaker with a great love of China who has traveled to some of the most sensitive parts of the Asian country, people who have worked with him said.
Kovrig is one of two Canadians being investigated on suspicion of harming China's security. They were picked up shortly after Canada arrested a senior Chinese executive at the request of the United States.
Stationed at the Canadian embassy in Beijing from 2014 to 2016, Kovrig served under former ambassador Guy Saint-Jacques, who described him as an excellent political officer.
Kovrig has visited the western Xinjiang region, site of mass detentions and strict surveillance of the ethnic Uighur minority and other Muslim groups, and dealt with other sensitive issues, said Saint-Jacques.
""When you meet with dissidents, you get the attention of the Chinese security establishment,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
At the end of his two-year posting, Kovrig told the envoy he wanted to stay on because ""he loves China so much."" He joined the Hong Kong-based International Crisis Group, a think tank focused on conflict resolution.
""He really is passionate about China, its language and its culture,"" said Karim Lebhour, head of ICG's North American communications in Washington, who said he had met Kovrig a few months ago. ""He struck me as very professional, very easy to engage with and a brilliant foreign policy mind.""
One area Kovrig focused on was North Korea, where Michael Spavor - the other detained Canadian - was also active.
Kovrig is still technically employed by the Canadian foreign affairs department but because he took a leave of absence, he does not have diplomatic immunity.
""The fact that Mr. Kovrig is an employee of my department means a lot of us know him and that adds another layer to the concern,"" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Wednesday.
Joanna Chiu, a reporter for the Toronto Star, wrote in the paper on Tuesday that she had met and befriended Kovrig while she was working in Beijing four years ago. 
""Michael is emotionally very open. Many in his social circle knew that he struggled with his decision to take a leave of absence from work as a diplomat in 2016,"" she wrote.
""He chose to do so because he didn't want another posting somewhere else. He wanted to stay in China and keep learning more about the country.""
Kovrig's most recent social media post was on Sunday. His family heard about his detention on Tuesday morning, his cousin Kate Kovrig said in a message on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) on Tuesday. 
Kovrig began his diplomatic career in 2014 as the first secretary and vice-consul at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing, following two years of Mandarin training, his LinkedIn profile showed.

Most of his Twitter posts are China-related, including several on Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer. Retweeting an FT opinion piece last week arguing that Huawei should be kept out of Britain's 5G networks for security reasons, he commented: ""Sensible cautionary advice on Huawei.""

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower in volatile trading on Thursday, as a rally sparked by progress in U.S.-China trade talks faded, with investors preferring defensive sectors such as real estate and utilities. 
Wall Street opened higher after a Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said Washington and Beijing were in close contact over trade, and any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome, adding to the optimism over trade progress between the two economic giants.
Trading, however, has been increasingly choppy and the major stock indexes' strong opening gains have petered out toward the end of the session in the past two days. 
On Thursday, the defensive utilities (SPLRCU) and real estate <.SPLRCR> rose more than 1 percent, while consumer staples (SPLRCS) was up 0.7 percent. 
""Utilities and consumer staples are two key defensive sectors where people go when they are trying to hide from volatility,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
The markets have also been pressured by a slew of headlines ranging from a potential U.S. government shutdown, interest rates to uncertainty around Brexit. 
Concerns over slowing global growth next year have also rattled investors.
""There is a narrative growing that there might be a recession in 2020,"" said Crit Thomas, global market strategist at Touchstone Investments in Cincinnati.
""So it's hard for the market to really get excited when you have that sort of a narrative hanging out there.""
Fueling the fears, a Reuters poll showed the U.S. Treasury yield curve will invert next year, possibly within the next six months, much earlier than forecast just three months ago, with a recession to follow as soon as a year after that.
At 1:03 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 12.09 points, or 0.05 percent, at 24,515.18. The S&P 500 (SPX) was down 7.57 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,643.50 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 45.07 points, or 0.63 percent, at 7,053.24.
Retail stocks dropped, with  Under Armour  (N:UAA) sliding 4.92 percent after the sportswear maker forecast 2019 revenue growth and profit below Wall Street estimates. The S&P retail index <.SPXRT> fell about 0.97 percent, snapping a three-day rally.

It blamed the poor results on lower transactions at Men’s Wearhouse, a trend that continued into November and was expected to hurt full-year adjusted earnings per share, which were lowered to a range of $2.30 to $2.35.
Clothing company Oxford Industries; (NYSE:OXM) third-quarter revenue and earnings fell short of expectations, sending its share price 8% lower.
The company also delivered downbeat outlook on the fourth quarter, a crucial period for retailers, but Wall Street said there was still reason for cheer.
The weakness could be attributed to a ""confluence of small issues,"" including website issues, poorer than expected gift promotions in November and December, KeyBanc Capital Markets' Edward Yruma said in a note.
The SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF was down more than 2%."

176,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>",Delta Air Lines shares drop on weak revenue outlook,"By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Shares in U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) dropped 4 percent in Thursday morning trading on concerns that slowing global economies would limit the No. 2 U.S. airline's revenue growth in 2019 despite strong travel demand.
At its investor day, Atlanta-based Delta forecast a 4 to 6 percent rise in revenues, compared to an average 5.6 percent rise forecast by Refinitiv data.
The lower end of Delta's 2019 profit forecast of $6 to $7 per share also fell short of an average $6.70 forecast by Refinitiv. 
U.S. airlines hiked fares and baggage fees in 2018 to drive revenues, but investors fear carriers will not be able to keep increasing prices as global economic growth slows.
Delta shares were down $2.29, or 4 percent at $53.97 shortly before noon EST (1700 GMT), underperforming a slight rise on the S&P 500 stock index. 
To boost revenues, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Delta would continue segmenting its cabins with an increased focus on higher-margin premium products. These now account for 30 percent of Delta's revenue stream, double the amount six years ago.
The airline plans to increase average seats per aircraft by 2 percent annually between 2018 and 2023, with premium seats growing by 40 percent on every aircraft. 
Delta also said it will start offering five different cabins on four of its aircraft next week, with a view to equipping all of its widebodies with the five cabins by 2021. 
Less than half of revenues currently come from its main cabin.
On fuel costs, Delta said it expects a $300 million drop in fuel expenses for 2019. Traditionally, airlines have taken advantage of lower fuel costs to add more flight and seat capacity, a measure that can also drive down unit revenues, a closely watched metric that compares airlines' sales to available seat miles.
Delta said it planned to increase capacity by about 3 percent in 2019. This is below a 4 to 6 percent capacity increase targeted by rival United Airlines (O:UAL), which has been trying to claw back market share against its larger peers.
Oil prices have fallen about 30 percent since hitting a four-year high in October.

Delta expects $3 to $4 billion in free cash flow, and about $4.5 billion in capital expenditures for 2019.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese battery firm halts purchases of cobalt from Glencore - sources,"By Pratima Desai and Tom Daly
LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese battery firm GEM has stopped buying cobalt from  Glencore  as the price of the battery material crashed below that agreed in a three-year deal between the two companies, sources close to the matter said. 
GEM (SZ:002340) said in a March 14 regulatory filing that it would buy 52,800 tonnes of cobalt from mining and trading giant Glencore (L:GLEN) between 2018 and 2020, without revealing the price.
Cobalt prices  on the London Metal Exchange have nearly halved to around $55,000 a tonne since late March, when they hit record highs on expected demand growth. Cobalt is crucial for the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries used to power electric vehicles, a growing sector of the auto industry.
Global prices tumbled due to a surplus of cobalt in China, the world's largest manufacturer of cobalt chemicals and electric vehicle batteries. The market is expected to struggle for some years to come due to expected oversupply. 
""The price went down so much,"" one source said, adding that GEM had no alternative supplier but was using its inventories of cobalt and that the Chinese firm had not attempted to renegotiate the contract recently.
According to the filing, GEM and its subsidiaries were to purchase 13,800 tonnes of cobalt from Glencore in 2018, 18,000 tonnes in 2019 and 21,000 tonnes in 2020.
""GEM didn't buy because of what happened to the price. They didn't open the letters of credit and said to Glencore, sorry, but we can't take it at the agreed price,"" another source said.

One source said GEM had tried to renegotiate the price, but that was much earlier in the year when cobalt was nearer $70,000 a tonne. Another source said there had been some moves recently to try to renegotiate.
The sources said they did not know whether Glencore would try to sue GEM, but one said Chinese law meant ""the odds are stacked against foreign firms"" wanting compensation when contracts had broken down.
GEM did not respond to a request for comment. Glencore declined to comment. 
Letters of credit are issued by banks to guarantee payments made to specific companies or people so long as requirements such as the delivery of goods are met.
Sources say GEM wasn't alone in stopping purchases, as some other Chinese firms making cobalt chemicals or lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles had also halted their buying.
Glencore in an investor update on Dec. 3 said some customers had reneged on contracts for cobalt. 
""All the material they haven't sold is sitting in warehouses in Johannesburg,"" a cobalt industry source said.
While the industry typically talks about cobalt metal, the surplus is in cobalt hydroxide, used to make sulphates for the cathode part of lithium-ion batteries.
Hydroxide is a byproduct of copper in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which houses the world's largest reserves of cobalt. The DRC is expected to produce nearly 90,000 tonnes this year in a market estimated at 135,000 tonnes.
Prices for cobalt hydroxide, a percentage of the metal price also known as payables, hit levels above 90 percent last year and have since slipped to around 65 percent.
""Payables are still around the 65 percent level, despite the Katanga news,"" the cobalt industry source said.
Glencore in November said its subsidiary Katanga Mining (TO:KAT) had halted cobalt exports from the Kamoto Project in the DRC while it builds a facility to remove uranium.
Guidance for cobalt production from Katanga was 11,000 tonnes this year and 34,000 tonnes in 2019. Guidance for 2019 was revised down to around 26,000 tonnes after the export halt.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Bond giant Pimco expects 30 percent chance of U.S. recession in '19,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Declining global economic growth rates will boost defensive stocks and could lead to opportunities in emerging market currencies and mortgage bonds in the year ahead, asset manager Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) said in its 2019 outlook on Thursday.
Higher interest rates and fading fiscal stimulus will leave the U.S. economy at a 30 percent chance of falling into a recession, the highest probability at any point during the nine-year economic expansion, Pimco said. 
""The models are flashing orange rather than red,"" the firm noted. 
A slowing economy will bring the U.S. growth rate closer to the stalled economies of China, Europe and Japan and limit inflation, making mortgage-backed securities an attractive alternative to investment-grade credit, Pimco wrote. 
""While the expansion has been aging gracefully, we believe the global economy is past peak growth in the cycle,"" the firm wrote. 
Falling growth expectations will depress valuations in the U.S. stock market and leave equity markets volatile in 2019, Pimco expects. There is also little likelihood of a breakthrough in the simmering trade war between the U.S. and China, the firm predicted.
""The conflict between the U.S. and China is more deep-rooted and about much more than trade alone, and would thus continue to be a source of uncertainty and volatility even if there were a deal on trade,"" the firm said. 

In Europe, UK financial bonds continue to look attractive given the low probability of a chaotic, no-deal Brexit, the firm noted. At the same time, the firm remains ""cautious"" on both sovereign credits and corporate bonds in peripheral Europe given Italy's budget deficit.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 11:57AM ET</span>",A higher Social Security retirement age comes with risks for many workers,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Is it time to raise the Social Security retirement age? The idea crops up often as a partial fix for the long-term financial challenges facing the program.
A higher retirement age would reduce the number of years on average that people receive benefits, as a way to cut program costs. But according to an economist at the Urban Institute who specializes in employment and retirement decisions made by older Americans, raising the retirement age would inflict serious harm on roughly one-quarter of Social Security beneficiaries.
In a report issued by the Urban Institute last month, Richard W. Johnson examines the arguments in favor and against a higher retirement age, considering trends and disparities in American workers’ life expectancy, health status and the labor market conditions that older workers face. (https://urbn.is/2qPHqyA)
When Social Security was created in 1935, benefits began at age 65. Starting in 1956 for women, and in 1961 for men, retirees could claim benefits as soon as age 62, but monthly benefits were reduced permanently depending on how early they filed. Meanwhile, the age when 100 percent of earned benefits are paid - the full retirement age (FRA) - began to rise gradually under reforms legislated in 1983. The FRA is gradually increasing to age 67 for workers born in 1960 or later; for example, workers born between 1943 and 1954 reach their FRA at age 66; for people born in 1955 the FRA will be 66 and two months. 
Social Security faces a long-run financial imbalance - the program is now spending more than it takes in annually in payroll taxes. The Social Security trustees project that the program will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034; unless Congress takes action, benefits would be slashed across-the-board by about 25 percent. 
Congress has three options for avoiding this dire outcome. It could raise revenue by increasing the payroll tax and increasing the share of wages subject to the tax. A second option is to cut benefits by reducing cost-of-living adjustments or through other benefit formula changes. The third option is raising retirement ages - effectively reducing the number of years, on average, when benefits are received. That could close roughly 27 percent of the long-term shortfall, Johnson calculates.
A LONGEVITY ARGUMENT
Rising longevity is one argument often made in favor of that last reform. Americans live several years longer, on average, than they did when the early retirement age was introduced, and longevity is forecast to rise 2.8 years by 2050, Johnson reports. “The program’s costs will rise as people live longer,” he told me in an interview. “Is there a certain number of years of life we want to finance in retirement that we maintain by shifting that period later?” 
The retirement age debate usually focuses on the FRA, but Johnson focuses mainly on whether the early retirement age should be increased. “If we want to raise the FRA, we also would want to raise the early age,” he said. “If the gap between the two gets too large, it would create inequities.” 
Here is what that means. Johnson calculates that filing at 62 currently translates into a 30 percent monthly benefit cut compared with filing at the FRA; if the FRA were increased to 69 without lifting the early age, that early-filing reduction would jump to a whopping 40 percent. “That might be a wash in lifetime benefits, depending on how long you live,” he said. “But the larger point for most retiree is, you pay your bills on a monthly basis.”
But increasing the early filing age would create hardships for many workers. If it were raised to age 65, Johnson estimates that 25 percent of workers aged 62 to 64 would face serious financial problems; that represents the share that is not working and has a health-related work limitation. 
These workers are more likely to have health problems in their early sixties that limit their work ability, Johnson concludes, and many will not be able to pass the strict medical and functional screens of Social Security Disability Insurance. He also cites ongoing reluctance among employers to hire older workers, and the fact that the recent gains in life expectancy have gone mainly to people with more education and income.
“We were seeing improvements in health status until 2000, but those have leveled off and we don’t know what will happen in the future,” Johnson said. “The most concerning part is we’re now seeing some indications that health status is declining for people in their sixties now, and for people in their forties and fifties, mainly due to rising obesity rates. All of that will make it much more difficult to raise retirement ages.”
Rising income inequality also contributes to the problem, he finds. Lower-income workers are more likely to retire early - and that means they will have lower incomes throughout retirement. Conversely, median income for older households without any health-related work limits rose 34 percent from 1996 to 2014, adjusted for household size and inflation. This was due to their greater likelihood of staying employed and receiving wage income.
What kind of policy changes could be made to buffer the most vulnerable people from higher retirement ages? Johnson suggests exempting workers in physically demanding occupations; making the Social Security benefit formula more progressive than it already is to favor low-earners even more; expanding employment services and training and expanding unemployment insurance for older workers.
But he concedes all of these would be challenging policies to achieve from a political standpoint. “Most programs for desperate people don’t get a lot of funding, so the prospects are not great,” he said. “There is a real risk that we could raise the early Social Security filing age and not offer enough protections to the people most at risk.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A JP Morgan analyst who has long held a negative outlook on  General Electric  Co (N:GE) shares as they have tumbled upgraded his view on the conglomerate's stock on Thursday.
GE shares surged after JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised his rating on GE shares to ""neutral"" from ""underweight."" Tusa initiated his bearish call on the stock on May 12, 2016; since that time, the stock had dropped 77.7 percent through Wednesday, and slumped to more than nine-year lows, amid struggles for GE's power business and concerns about its high debt.
GE shares jumped 10.7 percent to $7.43 in Thursday morning trading in heavy volume.
The analyst, who also noted that GE is being removed from JP Morgan's analyst focus list as a short idea, said in his report that the challenges GE faces are better understood, as opposed to being overlooked by those who have been bullish on the stock in the past.
Tusa kept his $6 price target for the stock, while noting downside risk to $5.
""The risk/reward ... is now more balanced in the near term, in our view, and we recommend investors step aside,"" Tusa wrote in a note.
In October GE posted a loss of $22.8 billion for the third quarter, as it slashed its dividend and said it faced a deepening federal accounting probe. New Chief Executive Larry Culp said last month the company will sell assets with ""urgency"" to reduce its high debt.
GE said on Thursday its digital unit would sell a majority stake in ServiceMax, a cloud-based provider of software used in inventory and workforce management. GE will retain a 10 percent equity in ServiceMax, a business it acquired for $915 million in 2016.
GE shares, which were removed from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) earlier this year, have tumbled more than 50 percent this year alone.
In his note, Tusa said a ""material equity raise"" from GE ""could be necessary."" While that could pressure the stock in the near term, Tusa said ""an equity raise is important, in our view, as it would help to blunt the chief risk we see in a downturn, namely the balance sheet.""

""We now believe a more negative outcome on the liabilities (equity dilution for one) is at least partially discounted, and it’s possible that the company can execute its way through an elongated workout that limits near term downside,"" Tusa said.

(Reuters) - It's been the stormiest year for Italian bond markets since the 2011 euro zone crisis, but as 2018 ends, investors who fled mid-year are returning and their worst fears -- euro exit, junk ratings and reckless spending -- have proved unfounded.
Often described as bond vigilantes for the way they impose fiscal discipline on profligate governments, debt investors punished Italy hard for proposing a draft budget deficit three times higher than it had pledged. Sovereign borrowing costs surged to five-year highs.
That creditor strike appears to have achieved its aim. Government bond yields, already down a fifth from the highs, lurched lower again this week after the conviction grew that a budget row with the European Commission would blow over without Rome incurring significant penalties.
That optimism is fed above all by Rome's decision to trim its 2019 deficit targets, after months of acrimony. With France moving this week to widen its own budget deficit, the EU is likely to accept Italy's new suggestion.
""We thought of this as an entry point,"" said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""You are getting relatively good yields, and if you have greater willingness on part of the EU to accommodate more expansionary budgets, from that perspective a 3 percent euro-denominated yield for 10 years looks phenomenal.""
Italian 10-year yields slipped just below that level on Thursday, while its yield premium over Germany -- effectively a measure of a euro credit's riskiness -- has snapped in more than half a percentage point from peaks.

With France's deficit now possibly approaching 3.5 percent of GDP, Italy unsurprisingly wants equal treatment. Some investors also accept that Rome needs to galvanize its moribund economy.
""Italy is not doing something system-destroying, it's not like they want a 5 to 6 percent deficit. The European Commission has to accept their need for growth,"" said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.
Ahmed's Italy position until recently was ""100 percent negative"". But heading into 2019, he has changed that to neutral, betting the Italy-Germany spread peaked a while back.
Foreigners sold 69 billion euros of government bonds between May and September, but after a 3 percent drop in foreign holdings in April-June, the biggest quarterly fall since 2012, selling slowed in the third quarter, the central bank said.
September outflows were 1.5 billion euros versus August's 17.4 billion euros.

SHORT-TERM 
Of course, Italy isn't out of trouble yet: a populist government remains in place, an EU penalty is still likely and with a weak economy, its 2.3 trillion-euro government debt saddles it with one of the world's worst debt ratios, 1.3 times annual output.
Debt issues will therefore certainly come back to haunt it. But this year at least, the worst fears have not materialised. Above all, says Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, one huge risk -- future redenomination of Italy's debt into lira -- has receded for now.
Lamy noted that gauges of euro breakup risk, which flashed bright at the height of the turmoil, have subsided, helped by a softer tone on the euro from firebrand Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
""A lot is already priced in. The market is not long (on Italian debt) as it was in May, it is neutral or short, so you won't get panic selling. So there is a positive dynamic from a technical point of view,"" said Lamy.
He has a small underweight on Italy but likes short-dated two-year debt because ""the carry is attractive and we don't expect them to leave the euro zone in this period.""
Two-year Italian securities yield 0.48 percent (IT2YT=RR) versus minus 0.17 percent in Spain (ES2YT=RR), rated two notches higher by S&P at A-.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, also said he had added to holdings of two-year debt.
Most big investors are keen on short-dated bonds, which are less vulnerable to euro break-up risk and the possibility of a credit rating downgrade to junk.
Italy has hung on to its investment-grade rating, which guarantees its place in IG-only bond indexes. Relegation to ""junk"" would have ejected it from these benchmarks, triggering billions of euros in forced selling.
But S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch keep Italy at BBB, two notches above junk. Moody's did cut to Baa3 in October, a rung above junk, but attached a ""stable"" outlook, meaning investment grade status is not immediately threatened.
ECB HAND
Rome needs investors on its side. It needs to raise 400 billion euros in 2019 for debt repayments and spending. But even though the European Central Bank's bond purchases will have ended, Italy will benefit from its reinvestment program -- BNP Paribas AM notes the ECB will buy 35 billion euros of Italian debt in 2019, not much below this year's 50 billion euros. 
Expectation is also building of more ECB stimulus, probably via cheap multi-year loans to banks -- some of which could leak into Italian bonds.
""I take the ECB at its word that if it can see a little willingness of the Italian government to look at deficit spending and try to control it, then they (the ECB) can solve the problems in the bond market,"" said Bob Michele, fixed income CIO at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""I think things will work out OK,"" he said.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Canary in the coal mine? Credit insurers pare back exposure in Turkey,"By Ebru Tuncay and Behiye Selin Taner
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Global credit insurers have cut exposure to some Turkish builders, retailers and other industries, four people familiar with the matter said, in what could be an early warning sign of a spike in bad debts.
For years, Turkish companies have borrowed cheaply in euros and dollars but a currency crisis, which sent the lira down as much as 47 percent against the dollar this year, has driven up the cost of servicing that debt.
Insurers have pared back coverage limits by 10 to 50 percent over the last few months, the sources said, to reflect the weaker financial position of some firms, including electricity companies.
Trade credit insurers provide coverage to companies for when a customer fails to pay. The insurer covers the debt and then tries to collect it itself.
Because they are in close contact with companies and check their payment abilities frequently, credit insurers can sometimes spot signs of financial distress ahead of banks.
""Credit insurance companies have reduced their coverage limits for companies that have problems,"" one person said, adding that more were defaulting on trade payments - especially those with large foreign-currency or short-term debts.
""This has been happening for the last two or three months."" 
All four sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the record.
France's  Coface  SA (PA:COFA), Allianz's (DE:ALVG) Euler Hermes unit and Spanish insurer Grupo Catalana Occidente's (MC:GCO) Atradius are major players in Turkey's trade credit insurance market, each guaranteeing around 4-4.5 billion euros of transactions.
Coface told Reuters it had observed a ""need to be more cautious"" towards the domestic-focused constuction, retail and other industries, as the weaker lira and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in domestic demand.
Euler Hermes said it was being cautious to support ""reliable trade"" but it had no general policy to tighten coverage limits.
Atradius said it was standard procedure to cut limits for firms facing a liquidity squeeze, or those that had bounced cheques, defaulted on bank loans, filed for protection from creditors or faced negative net capital. It said any limit cuts were not made on a industry-specific basis. 
BANK DEBTS
The lira fell as much as 47 percent against the dollar this year on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's control over monetary policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. It has recovered since the height of the crisis in August, but is still down some 30 percent.
The sell-off pushed inflation to its highest in 15 years and has deepened concern about banks.
Despite the signs of strain, Turkish banks' non-performing loan (NPL) ratios officially remain low - although analysts say that is likely to change. 
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's expects bad loans to roughly double over the next 12-18 months, to about 6 percent from 3.5 percent at the end of September. 
S&P also reckons that problem loans may be much higher than the figures show. By using a wider definition - one that includes restructured loans - bad debts already exceed 10 percent of total loans and could go up to 20 percent, it said.
""We still don't fully understand the ... vulnerabilities in the banking system,"" EBRD chief economist Sergei Guriev told Reuters in a recent interview. 
""We only use official information so it's very hard for us to comment on the true extent of NPLs, quality of assets.""
Turkey has seen a swell in the number of distressed companies applying for protection from creditors this year, a process known as ""concardato"". 
Well known firms that have been granted concordato include intercity coach operator Pamukkale Turizm, shoe maker Yesil Kundura and construction firm Nuhoglu Insaat.
Companies with heavy debt burdens that have recorded losses for the last few years are on the radar of credit insurers for limit reductions, said a second source.

While insurers are mostly cutting limits by between 10-50 percent, there are some cases where the limits are being set to zero, according to the third source.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An array of companies and groups that have opposed T-Mobile US Inc's (N:TMUS) plan to buy Sprint Corp (N:S) announced on Thursday that they had banded together, saying the deal would lead to higher prices for wireless customers and hurt rural consumers.
The group includes companies like C-Spire and  DISH Network  (O:DISH), the Communications Workers of America, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association and advocacy groups like Public Knowledge. In their statement, they asked the Federal Communications Commission to reject the deal.
""T-Mobile and Sprint's vague promises to create jobs and provide better service to rural America do not meet the public interest test for approval of the merger,"" said Debbie Goldman, research and telecommunications policy director, Communications Workers Association.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two top Democratic U.S. senators called on Thursday for the Senate to open an investigation into Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) over its compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering and bank secrecy laws.
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen said in a statement that they had written to the chair of the Senate Banking Committee asking for the probe in light of investigations into the bank by European authorities that called into question its compliance controls.
A spokeswoman for Mike Crapo, the Republican chair of the Senate Banking committee who has the power to approve a probe, declined to comment. 
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the bank takes its legal obligations seriously and is prepared to cooperate with any official investigations.
Thursday's request adds pressure to the bank, which is already facing police probes in Germany and likely is to face official congressional scrutiny in the United States when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in January.
Police raided six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt last month over money laundering allegations linked to the “Panama Papers.” Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor’s office said at the time.
Deutsche Bank said at the time of the raids that it would cooperate closely with the Frankfurt public prosecutor's office, adding it believed it had already provided all the relevant information related to the ""Panama Papers"".
""Given the Committee’s jurisdiction over banking regulatory enforcement, Deutsche Bank’s history of regulatory problems, and the recent allegations of money laundering that resulted in the recent raid conducted by German law enforcement, we request that the Banking Committee undertake an investigation into Deutsche Bank and its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations,"" Warren and Van Hollen wrote to Crapo.
Specifically, the pair said they were particularly concerned about Deutsche Bank's role in correspondent banking, worrying that its relationships with other foreign banks could aid in money laundering or evading U.S. sanctions.
Beyond those concerns, Democrats have also targeted the bank for its business dealings with President Donald Trump. Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has attempted to subpoena documents from the bank detailing its accounts with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank.

Republicans in charge of the committee ignored those document demands, but Waters is set to take control of the committee in January and will have power to issue those subpoenas herself if she chooses.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Huawei $2 billion security pledge followed walkout by British official: sources,"By Jack Stubbs
LONDON (Reuters) - Huawei's relations with British authorities hit a low last month when a top official walked out of a meeting with the Chinese company over its perceived failure to fix security holes in its products, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
Although Huawei responded with a pledge to spend $2 billion on a security overhaul to address the British concerns, tensions between London and the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment remain high as it fights U.S.-led allegations of Chinese state spying..
""Previously, you very much had British civil servants saying 'please do this' and asking rather than telling or banging the table,"" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. ""Huawei HQ now have the message.""
The fraught nature of the meeting between Huawei executives and Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) underlines the challenge facing the company in convincing Western governments its equipment is safe.
A spokesman for the NCSC - part of Britain's GCHQ spy agency - said the meeting in late November ""ended prematurely because of increased tensions"", but declined to provide any further details because the conversations were private. 
Huawei did not respond directly to questions about the meeting or its talks with the NCSC, but said British officials had ""identified some areas for improvement in our engineering processes.""
""We are grateful for this feedback and committed to addressing these issues,"" it said in a statement. 
Huawei has come under intense scrutiny as countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan follow U.S. moves to restrict access to their markets, citing security concerns. 
The company has repeatedly denied allegations that it facilitates Chinese espionage. 
The arrest last week in Canada of its chief financial officer and founder's daughter, Meng Wanzhou, on U.S. charges that she misled multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions has ramped up the pressure. Meng, who has been freed on bail, has said she is innocent and will contest the allegations in the United States if extradited.
Huawei now increasingly needs to secure the approval of British authorities, who have so far resisted U.S. calls to act against the company and say they guard against security threats by having Huawei products reviewed at a special company laboratory.
But a British government report released in July found that technical and supply-chain ""shortcomings"" with Huawei equipment had exposed national telecom networks to new security risks.
Sources told Reuters that NCSC officials had become frustrated by Huawei's slow response to the report and its findings, which included issues raised in previous years about limitations on checking internal product code.
The report's critical language and NCSC Technical Director Ian Levy's dramatic exit from the November meeting showed company officials in China they needed to take prompt and significant action, the sources said.

The NCSC spokesman said relations with Huawei have been ""strained since the report, but underlining that is a commitment to find solutions. We continue to have consistent dialogue.""

The Chinese joint venture, Bombardier Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd (BST), launched in 1998, is 50 percent owned by Chinese locomotive firm CRRC Sifang Locomotive & Rolling Stock Co Ltd. 
In September, CRC awarded the joint venture a contract worth $324 million to supply 120 train cars by the end of this year.
Bombardier's Berlin-based transportation unit has six joint ventures in China, seven wholly foreign-owned enterprises and more than 7,000 employees, the company said in a statement.
Together, the joint ventures have delivered more than 4,000 railway passenger cars, 580 electric locomotives and over 2,500 metro cars, Monorail, APM (Automated People Mover), and trams to China’s growing urban mass-transit markets.
The win for Bombardier comes in the middle of escalating diplomatic tension between Beijing and Ottawa, resulting in China detaining two Canadians this weeks on allegations they harmed state security. 
The dispute started after China reacted angrily to Canada's arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], at the request of the United States. Meng was released on bail on Tuesday.

Bombardier representatives were not immediately available to comment on whether the dispute has affected their dealings in China.

BORDEAUX, France (Reuters) - Ford (N:F) will end production at its Blanquefort plant in France by late August next year after rejecting a rescue deal for the factory, in a move which drew the ire of France's finance minister due to the risk of large-scale job losses. 
The French government had this autumn expressed optimism that the plant in southwest France and its 850 employees would be saved, but Ford told the plant's works council that it had rejected the bid made by transmission supplier Punch Powerglide.
""Despite thorough and rigorous talks over the past nine months, and the best efforts of both sides, the plan put forward by the potential buyer presents significant risks,"" Ford said in a statement to the works council. 
""We do not believe that the prospective buyer's plans offer the level of security or protection, or limit the risk of possible future job losses, that we would like for the employees,"" added the company.
The likely job losses will be a blow for President Emmanuel Macron, coming at a time of public rebellion over his reforms to liberalize the economy, including an easing of labor laws, and battles to haul down the country's stubbornly high unemployment.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in September had described Punch Powerglide as a ""credible, solid buyer,"" and Le Maire reacted angrily to Ford's decision, and called on the U.S. company to change its mind.
""I am revolted, I am sickened by this decision whose only justification is for Ford to get its shares to rise on the stock market,"" Le Maire told the French Senate.

""I want to attack the cowardice of Ford. For the last three days I have been looking to talk to them, and they didn't even have the courage to talk to the minister of finance and economy over the phone,"" added Le Maire.

The benchmark index even briefly slipped into a correction — defined by a loss of at least 10% from its recent peak. And while trade tensions appear  to be thawing, giving investors some hope, there's a technical indicator that poses a threat to bullish momentum.
The 'death cross.'
A death cross forming in the  S&P 500 is never a welcome development for investors. After all, the long-term technical indicator denotes short-term momentum is slowing, and is widely viewed as a bearish signal.
And this time around, the death cross could prove even more damaging, according to a new report from Bank of America's technical analysts.
The current death cross — when a security's short-term moving average falls beneath its 200-day moving average, or in popular cases the 50-day falling beneath its 200-day — which formed on December 7, features a declining 200-day moving average. That bodes particularly poorly for the market, if history is any indication.
Zooming out and examining more historical context for death crosses featuring falling 200-day moving averages paints an even grimmer picture.
The percentage of time the market rose following S&P 500 death crosses while the 200-day was in decline dropped to 25% from 59.43% for the 20-day return period, according to the report.
Furthermore, ""the standard deviation of returns dropped across all return periods, implying more consistent inhibited returns after a Death Cross with a declining 200-day MA.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Four weeks of anti-government protests that have hit French brick-and-mortar retailers are also taking their toll on online peers during the crucial Christmas shopping season, said the country's Fevad E-Commerce Federation.
Online retailers were expected to have benefited from disruption to major shopping areas due to the protests.
However, a Fevad survey of its members over the first nine days of December showed online sales were flat on a year-on-year basis during the period.
""It seems there is no carry-over effect for online retailers. The feedback we get is that it's very quiet, it's flat. It's not the growth that was expected,"" a Fevad spokeswoman told Reuters.
""There is a psychological impact from the events and the next 10 ten days will be crucial,"" she added.
In early November - before the protests started - Fevad had predicted that the French would spend 19 billion euros ($22 billion) on online purchases over Christmas and the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales days in November.
That in turn ought to have lifted total online retail sales to over 90 billion euros for 2018, added Fevad at the time. 
When asked to discuss its performance, Amazon (O:AMZN) - which is France's largest online retailer - said: ""As usual, year-end festivities are a time of strong activity.""
French retailers have lost at least 1 billion euros in revenue since the protests began around a month ago, the FCD retail federation has said.
Unlisted retailer Auchan [AUCH.UL] told Reuters this week it lost 100 million euros in revenue as 60 of its 120 hypermarkets had experienced disruptions due to the protests.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has also forecast that the protests would trim 0.1 percent of a point off national output.
Some demonstrators are calling for a fifth Saturday of protests.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 08:58AM ET</span>",UK's Nissan Brexit letter still too confidential to release two years on: FOI,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - A British government letter to Nissan two years ago offering reassurances about Brexit, which helped secure a major investment from the Japanese carmaker, is still considered too sensitive to release, a Reuters freedom of information request revealed.
Nissan (T:7201) announced in October 2016 that it would build its next generation Qashqai sports utility vehicle and a new X-Trail model at its north of England facility, in a major Brexit boost for Prime Minister Theresa May.
A source told Reuters at the time that in the letter Britain promised Nissan extra support in the event that its departure from the European Union hit the competitiveness of the plant.
The letter sparked concerns of secretive deals between the government and companies, with business minister Greg Clark promising in December 2016 to release the document once it was no longer sensitive.
Reuters has repeatedly asked for the letter to be released, and in its latest response to a freedom of information request (FOI), the business ministry said it was still too sensitive to be disclosed. 
""The commercial confidentialities are ongoing,"" officials said. ""We remain in touch with the company about these issues. It is important that we do not release information prematurely that would harm Nissan’s competitiveness position."" 
But earlier this year, the office of Britain's information commissioner, which oversees the FOI procedure, said the business, energy and industrial strategy ministry (BEIS) expected the letter would be released in 2018.
""Given the scale of the Nissan investment and procurement exercise, which is still underway, the expected date of publication had slipped somewhat,"" it wrote in a document dated Jan. 9. 
""BEIS advised the Commissioner that they expected the exercise to conclude in the first quarter of 2018 and for the letter to be published around this time, when the commercial sensitivities would reduce."" 
Nissan said on Thursday that Clark outlined the contents of the correspondence to parliament in October 2016. 
""While it remains commercially sensitive, we will not comment further on the details of our conversations with the UK government,"" it added.

The automaker said at the time that support and assurances from the authorities enabled it to make the investment decision.

Investors focused on smaller stocks would do best to buy companies with strong levels of free cash flow and solid balance sheets, with Japan and emerging markets including Brazil a better bet than the U.S., according Eduardo Lecubarri, the bank’s small- and mid-cap strategist. He said he is “not touching things that are cyclical.”
“Can we see a rally next year? Sure,” Lecubarri said in an interview Wednesday. “For me, it won’t be big enough or last long enough to be wanting to chase financials and cyclicals here.”
While Lecubarri has less conviction on which countries are best for investing, he says the Russell 2000’s 5.2 percent drop this year is quite small after two years of double-digit gains, and the benchmark U.S. small-cap index has more room to fall.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Denmark's Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) and India's  United Breweries  (NS:UBBW) have filed pleas with Indian authorities, seeking leniency in a probe into alleged collusion to fix beer prices, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating the two companies, as well as the world's largest brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (AB InBev) (BR:ABI). 
Last year, as previously reported by Reuters, AB InBev told the regulator it had discovered an industry cartel that discussed and agreed on beer prices before submitting them to Indian states, which regulate pricing.
The company's confidential disclosure under the CCI's whistleblower-protection scheme led to dawn raids by the regulator in October at offices of all three of the brewers.
In recent weeks, both Carlsberg and United Breweries filed pleas under the CCI's so-called leniency programme, submitting evidence and agreeing to cooperate, the sources said, adding that such cooperation could lead to a smaller fine if wrongdoing is discovered.
A Carlsberg spokesman in India said it was ""cooperating fully with the CCI"" and had done so from the beginning of the probe.
United Breweries, part-owned by Heineken, did not respond to requests for comment. Following the Reuters story on the October raids, it told the Indian stock exchanges it was reviewing its legal risks and the potential implications. Heineken declined to comment.
An AB InBev spokesman in India said they take antitrust compliance ""very seriously"", but declined to comment further. 
LIKE A GAME OF ""POKER""
The three brewers account for 90 percent of beer consumption in the $7 billion Indian market, where rising social acceptance towards drinking and a growing pub culture are helping the industry to grow.
They collectively face an estimated fine of up to $279 million if found to have operated as a cartel. Individual executives can also be fined, though AB InBev could escape all of its share of the fines as it reported the issue.
The CCI's leniency programme grants relief through lower penalties to subsequent applicants only if they add value to evidence already held by the regulator from its own investigation and from the initial applicant, in this case AB InBev. But the filings remain confidential and companies do not know of others' submissions.
""It's like playing blind, like in poker,"" said one of the sources.
The CCI did not respond to questions from Reuters. 
Gautam Shahi, a New Delhi-based antitrust lawyer, said subsequent leniency applications were typically filed to reduce potential penalties.
""It's a promise of cooperation in return for a lenient treatment,"" said Shahi, who is not involved in the case.
During the October raids, the CCI found e-mails that showed executives regularly discussed beer prices, potentially violating Indian anti-trust laws, a government source said at the time. 
One of the sources told Reuters the CCI was still collecting evidence and reviewing the various leniency petitions but the investigation would be likely to continue for a year.
United Breweries is known for its  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) brand while AB InBev's beer brands include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois. Carlsberg sells beer under its own-name brand among others and also owns Tuborg.

The antitrust investigation is set to cast a shadow on the beer industry in India, which is already facing stringent compliance and state-level regulation, making it tougher for brewers to expand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Santa made a lackluster attempt to deliver his traditional end of year rally on Thursday, as world stocks squeezed out a third day of gains and the pound and the euro both stayed firm after the latest bout of Brexit drama.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May's survival in a late night no-confidence vote has not changed the markets' questions on Brexit but along with tentative signs of truces in the U.S.-China trade war and Italy's budget feud it was enough to keep them jolly.
The Nikkei and other Asian stocks had pushed roughly 1 percent higher and Europe enjoyed a largely uneventful morning. (EU) Even the long-awaited confirmation that the European Central Bank was ending its quantitative easing program did little to rouse activity. 
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1390, having largely traded in a $1.16 and $1.12 range since August. That made the dollar a touch softer while the pound was up for a second day at $1.2665. [/FRX]
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,"" the ECB said.
Though the ECB will technically now stop QE, it will still keep buying German, Italian and other euro zone bonds, possibly for years, using proceeds from the $2.6 trillion mountain of debt it has bought over the last few years. 
Analysts were now waiting to hear what signals Mario Draghi sends at his 1330 GMT news conference. Next year will be his last in charge of the ECB.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) FX strategist Hans Redeker said all eyes would be on Draghi and the ECB's messaging. ""It may revise its growth projections lower but continue to prepare the markets for allowing QE to end.""
Short-dated Italian bond yields - which move inversely to price - hit their lowest in six months after the country's government confirmed it would cut its deficit goal for 2019, potentially ending months of wrangling with Brussels.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the deficit goal had been lowered to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product from the 2.4 percent it had originally proposed, and it expected the European Commission to accept the proposal.
Two-year Italian bond yields tumbled to 0.51 percent, which took them back to where they were before a late May eruption of tensions triggered the worst day for short-term Italian debt in 25 years. [GVD/EUR]
Italy's five-year and 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest level in 2 1/2 months, while the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread improved to its tightest since the start of October. 
""I think the momentum can carry on in the near term as we have a number of supportive factors for Italian debt beyond just the hopes the budget deal can be reached,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Christoph Rieger.
On Brexit, May was heading to an EU summit in Brussels after her confidence vote win to try and secure some additional concessions on the controversial Irish border aspect of the agreement to placate rebels within her own party and Northern Irish Ulster Unionist allies. 
Markets reckon May’s continued premiership for now makes a ""no deal"" Brexit less likely at the margins, and her survival takes at least some of the immediate headline risk out of the market – even if the parliamentary impasse over the terms of Brexit looks no closer to being resolved. 
The pound was trading at $1.2670 as the first U.S. trading started, still well up more than cent from the 20-month lows set early Wednesday, and at about the levels seen just before the results of the confidence vote on Wednesday night. 
FULL OF BEANS 
In Asia, gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gaining 1.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei stock index ended 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.1 percent.
Markets are slowly becoming less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two big powers.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies had bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months.
The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal.
But markets have been stung by false dawns in the past. Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines.
""U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,"" he said. ""We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.""
In the commodities markets, oil prices steadied, under pressure from high inventories but buoyed by a drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles and the indications that the U.S.-China trade war may be easing.
Copper, which is highly sensitive to China's fortunes, also rose to a one-week high in the metals market at it approached $6,200 a tonne although it remains badly beaten having lost almost 15 percent this year.

""Signs of positive progression in trade talks between the U.S. and China should see sentiment in the commodity market remain positive,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 08:11AM ET</span>",Debt-trapped Czechs excluded as economy grows,"By Robert Muller
USTI NAD LABEM, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Olga Petikova first borrowed a few hundred dollars in the 1990s to furnish her young family's apartment. Later, she turned to payday loans to make ends meet as her husband struggled to make his new business a success. The debt soared.
Two decades on, she owes 2 million crowns ($86,938), 11 times her annual income, and is subject to 15 seizure orders on her property and much of the money reaching her bank account.
Her case is not uncommon in the Czech Republic, now the richest of the European Union's ex-communist countries. 
People in the same situation often work in the black market to avoid having to declare income that will be forfeited to repay their debts, aggravating a labor shortage cited by nearly two-thirds of companies as an obstacle to growth. 
Similar ""debt traps"" -- the result of poor financial awareness, years of loose regulation of lenders, costly repossessions and tough laws on bankruptcy -- also help fuel support for extremist politicians in poorer areas. 
Even small debts like unpaid fines or utility bills can grow into sums many can never repay. ""I just tell my children to never do like I did,"" Petikova told Reuters. 
She now has a stable job but most of her salary goes on debt repayments. She gets by with help from her now-adult children. 
At the end of 2017, 863,000 Czechs -- nearly 10 percent of the adult population -- faced at least one seizure order, meaning their income above a legal minimum can be redirected to cover debts and fees. Half of them faced four or more orders.
A total 4.67 million of seizure orders were outstanding, including for companies, for debts with a face value of 239 billion crowns ($10.8 billion) -- nearly 5 percent of GDP. 
In neighboring Germany, whose population is eight times larger, there were 2.48 million seizure orders, official data shows. 
Seizures in Slovakia, with only half the Czech population, were even higher, at 3.76 million in late 2017, but personal bankruptcies had cut that to 2.89 million a year later.
A recent survey showed some 60 percent of Czech companies see lack of skilled workers as an obstacle to growth, compared to a European average of 42 percent. 
While prospective workers are unwilling to labor for no gain, the paperwork required to employ a person with a seizure order is also a burden on companies, said Eva Velickova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Confederation of Industry. 
""The indebtedness of people is a problem for both society and the economy,"" Velickova said. 
The tough Czech approach to debtors is rooted in the country's transformation from communism. 
Laws to encourage private enterprise adopted in the early 2000s made it easier for creditors to get their money back by paying a repossession agent to collect the debt.
Agents' fees were once so lucrative that some offered to pay more than 100 percent of nominal value for hard-to-recover small debts, according to Daniel Hule of People in Need, a human rights group that focuses domestically on social exclusion. 
(For a graphic on 'Czech seizure orders on the rise' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2RFxGCM)
""We let the law be bent against society, in favor of various interest groups. That is the main problem,"" Hule said. ""Rather than (the Czech) population being delinquent, it is a relic of a bad system.""
Fees are lower now, but a standard seizure procedure can quickly transform a debt of around 1,000 crowns -- the fine for riding public transport without a ticket -- into about 10,500 crowns, according to a calculator on People In Need's website http://www.vymahacikalkulacka.cz. 
In Germany, the equivalent figure would be about 3,900 crowns.
(For a graphic on 'Cost of Czech debts' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2RNiXFG)
OUT OF THE LABOR MARKET
Seizure of income can leave debtors with as little as 6,225 crowns ($273.23) per month, a quarter of the average net wage for a single person. Half of seizures are for debts of 10,000 crowns or less.
This can be boosted by welfare payments but those are lost as income rises -- taking away any incentive to earn more. A 2016 study for the human rights minister said tens of thousands of people were working only illegally due to account seizures.
""Debtors lose motivation not just to work harder, but to work at all, they often drift to the grey economy,"" said Ladislav Mincic, chief analyst at the Czech Chamber of Commerce. ""In the border regions, many of them flee out of the country in order to avoid seizure orders.""
With unemployment at a two-decade low of 2.8 percent, there were just 193,000 available workers for 324,000 job vacancies in November.
The harsh treatment of debtors has often fueled support in poor areas for far-right and far-left political parties. Usti nad Labem region, near the German border, where 18 percent of the population have seizure orders, is the Communist party's electoral stronghold. 
""Extreme parties get (votes) from those around who see the higher crime rate, money leaving the region and a poorer offer of services. This is all connected to the seizure orders,"" said Daniel Prokop, a sociologist at the Median polling agency.
Debt problems even burden thousands of children, according to People in Need, who helped 15-year-old orphan Lidka take her case to the Constitutional Court. 
Lidka, who gave only her first name when speaking to Reuters in Pilsen, said she had owed 40,000 crowns from twice being caught on public transport without a ticket -- aged six and 11. The court ruled in 2017 that she must pay the original fare and the fine -- around 2,000 crowns.
BANKRUPTCIES NOT EASY REMEDY
A move by authorities to license non-bank lenders has seen nearly 90 percent withdraw from the market. About 85 remain. 
About 20,000 people a year apply for personal bankruptcy in the hope of escaping their debts. 
But rules are tough: for bankruptcy to be declared, a debtor must prove they can pay at least 30 percent of what they owe within five years. That can now be waived by the courts, but only retroactively after five years.
In Germany and Slovakia, there is no threshold.
Ludmila Krivkova, 42, owes 850,000 crowns from 14 loans taken out over five years. 
One of the companies she used, Pujcka7, advertises a 14-day loan of 5,000 crowns which turns into a 5,946 crown repayment -- an annual debt servicing cost of 9,064 percent, according to a calculation on the lender's website. Pujcka7 did not respond to requests for comment.
""I took a loan to refurbish our daughters' room, then also to buy food. And then the circle started, paying a loan with another loan,"" she said in her flat in Usti.
People in Need helped Ludmila file for personal bankruptcy. After five years, she will be out of trouble -- as long as she keeps paying 6,200 crowns each month towards her debts.
That leaves 5,000 crowns for her family. Thanks to social benefits and alimony, she manages. 

""There used to be enforcers, calls from hidden phone numbers, letters,"" said Ludmila. ""That is over... It is quiet now.""

MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) could review its 5 billion euro ($5.7 billion) Italian investment plan, which includes a shift to cleaner engines, if Rome raises taxes on petrol and diesel cars.
""Were these measures to be confirmed as of 2019, a thorough examination of their impact and an update to plans already announced would be necessary,"" FCA's (MI:FCHA) Europe head, Pietro Gorlier, said in a letter to government representatives in the northern Piedmont region, where some of the new investment would be targeted. 
In an amendment to the 2019 budget law passed in Italy's lower house last week, the government approved subsidies of up to 6,000 euros for lower emission vehicles, but included a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros on petrol and diesel cars. 
However, the government immediately vowed to change it in the Senate, where it will be voted on next, after one of the ruling parties contested the measure.
Italy's ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - have been at odds over the issue, with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars, while the pro-environment 5-Star has encouraged the new rules.
Unions and auto sector associations have also warned about the proposed new tax, saying it would hurt not only the carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs.
FCA said last month it plans to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and cleaner engines in Italy over the next three years to boost jobs and profitability.
5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has since said the government would seek to improve the measures to not harm families in difficulties and to not create a shock to the Italian economy.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Japan Post to invest $2.6 billion in U.S. insurer Aflac: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Post Holdings Co (T:6178), is planning to invest about $2.6 billion in  Aflac Inc  (N:AFL), aiming to become the largest shareholder in the U.S. insurer, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Japan Post, a conglomerate that spans postal delivery, banking and insurance services, plans to initially acquire a 7 to 8 percent stake in Aflac for about 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion), said the person.
Under the deal Japan Post can increase its stake to a maximum 20 percent in four years time, the person said. Aflac's current largest shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc with a 8.77 percent stake, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. 
Aflac said in a statement it was engaged in discussions with Japan Post regarding a potential minority investment in Aflac but the discussions did not involve Aflac or any of its subsidiaries becoming a member of Japan Post Group. 
Aflac did not elaborate further. A spokesman at Japan Post declined to comment. 
The transaction, which is expected to be announced this month, will follow the agreement made in 2013 between Japan Post and Aflac which allows Aflac to sell its cancer insurance at Japan Post's offices across Japan. 
The news was earlier reported by the Nikkei business daily.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and others back risk management startup AccessFintech","By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) have invested $17.5 million in AccessFintech, a startup that sells technology to help financial firms better handle business errors, the companies said on Thursday.
Israel-based AccessFintech has created a network that aggregates and helps resolve so-called business ""exceptions"", or errors that financial institutions make when carrying out business activities and that require interventions to be resolved. 
In capital markets, these errors may include data discrepancies between counterparties on the financial terms of a trade or wrong information used to identify a client. Once spotted the errors are normally handled manually, via numerous phone calls and emails between various firms.
AccessFintech's technology will help reduce the time and resources needed to resolve these issues by helping financial institutions communicate with each other. It will also reduce the risks associated with the errors. 
Large banks have become more open to collaborating with each other and with young financial technology startups on areas that do not give them an edge over rivals. 
""We see a dramatic level of difference as to what banks are willing to collaborate on, or outsource to shared vendors instead of building internally,"" Roy Saadon, founder and chief executive of AccessFintech, said in an interview. ""We see the banks in a search for efficiency in the places where things are not competitive."" Saadon was one of the co-founders of market infrastructure provider Traiana. 
All four banks have been working with AccessFintech over the past year, individually and as a group, the companies said. AccessFintech's customers also include asset managers, custodians and fund administrators. 
""Once we understood the impact on the operational model of the financial participants it was a quick decision to provide the financial backing,"" Ana Capella, head of strategic investments at JPMorgan, said in a statement. 

AccessFintech, which also has offices in London and other financial centers, will use the funding to grow its business, accelerating efforts including in sales and client coverage, Saadon said.

270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",The Bull Case For Stocks Is Compelling,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The stock market is vulnerable to the manic behavior of investors who lurch between greed and fear. This happens so often that it is regarded as normal. The market is now priced for the fear of an imminent recession, which is unlikely. Barring some unexpected adverse shock, equities represent an exceptional buying opportunity.
Let’s start with market valuations. The S&P 500 Index is trading at about 15 times expected 2019 earnings of $178 per share below the average of about 16.2 times over the past 50 years. By itself, this is sufficient to suggest stocks are cheap, but that valuation is skewed by a few very large, rapidly growing firms that are valued at dramatic premiums to the average.
Excluding the “FANG” group of stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), plus throw in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for good measure), the remaining 495 stocks in the S&P 500 are priced at less than 13 times expected 2019 earnings. That’s not the only sign of cheapness. The appropriate price/earnings multiple for the stock market is inversely related to the level of interest rates, since valuations are discounted flows of future earnings. With rates still at historically low levels, stock multiples should be decidedly above historical averages. Historically, with inflation around 2 percent, the average price earnings multiple has been around 19 times earnings.
According to Value Line, more than 100 companies trade at forward price/earnings multiples below 8. There hasn’t been so many cheap since the peak of the credit crisis in late 2008, when forward earnings projections were probably not worth much anyway. The last time the market saw more stocks with single-digit price/earnings multiples was in 1984, after inflation was coming off its peak of 10 percent, 30-year Treasury bond yields were coming down from 15 percent, and Fed policy rates had decreased from above 20 percent.
And yet, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. Some deceleration is evident, but that’s a desirable change. It is highly doubtful and a view of only a small minority that economic growth above 3 percent can be sustained for any significant period of time. Even the 2 percent growth rate experienced for much of the recovery from 2009 until 2018 was sufficient to drive unemployment down from 10 percent to 4 percent. The faster pace of growth in 2018 is rendering the labor market ever tighter, and the inability to find workers has become an impediment to growth, while putting upward pressure on labor costs and inflation. A slowdown might actually extend the life of the expansion.
The retreat in stock prices reflects a fear that the Fed might raise rates sufficiently to precipitate a recession, or that one may be underway already. This seems to be fear run amok. Some point to the slowdown in housing as signaling weakness, although there are multiple factors at work here. More expensive homes are under exceptional pricing pressure because of the loss of property tax deductions. In the Northeast, lower-priced homes continue to sell rapidly, mid-priced homes sell slowly, and expensive homes sell by appointment, if that frequently. In multiple communities, homes priced above $1.5 million to $2 million have two years’ supply on the market.
The nearly inverted yield curve is another factor used to project a recession. It is factually true that every recession in the post-World War II period has been preceded by an inverted yield curve. However, not every inverted yield curve is followed by a recession. Plus, the average period between inversion and recession is more than two years. Purveyors of the doom-is-nigh thesis are getting ahead of the data.
Nothing could be more attractive for corporate profits and stock prices than for the economy to continue expanding at a moderate 2 percent pace while rates remain low. The mere suggestion of some sort of detente between the U.S. and China on trade could trigger a massive rally and a new manic phase. And that would be entirely consistent with the market’s normally erratic behavior."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has launched a strategic review to outline changes under incoming chief executive Guillaume Faury as it faces industrial challenges and prepares for overdue modernization, industry sources said.
The ""Airbus Next Chapter"" review involves a team of planners working outside the normal strategy organization in pursuit of a break from years of industrial problems, management feuds and an ongoing bribery scandal.
It is being led by former investor relations chief Julie Kitcher in what one insider described as a signal to financial markets that profits will be embedded in strategy, as the once state-sponsored European project marks its 50th anniversary.
Planemaking boss Faury, who becomes CEO when Tom Enders retires next April, ""wants to go fast and introduce a new state of mind; he wants to turn the page on the past,"" a person familiar with the company said.
Airbus declined comment on the review, which is designed to war-game strategic decisions and possible structural changes.
Founded in 1969, Airbus (PA:AIR) has risen to compete on a par with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and is one of Europe's leading exporters.
But its growth has been punctuated by Franco-German tensions, personal rivalries and most recently a crippling bribery investigation that accelerated management departures.
The review may address how Airbus can meet demand by sharply ramping up production of jets like its A320. One previous taboo that may come up for discussion is a fragmented production system securing jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
The A320 is the lifeblood of Europe's largest aerospace group, described by operations chief Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB), who retires later this month, as the ""golden goose"".
Executives are warning Airbus must not find itself lacking in proven technology for the A320's successor after 2030, as it had been in wide-bodies when Boeing launched its 787.
For now, Airbus is winning a bigger slice of the market on the A320 but some analysts say it has fallen behind Boeing in manufacturing techniques - a gap that could grow if Boeing launches a mid-market jet with a new factory system.
The review may study how Airbus can compete with Silicon Valley for talents in the digital era, while handling a wave of departures through retirements and a board-driven clearout.
Spurning global firms that typically work for Airbus, Faury has brought in Zurich-based consultants Egon Zehnder who are better known as head-hunters. 
The roll-call of scheduled retirements continued this week as Alberto Gutierrez was named head of military aircraft as Fernando Alonso steps down after stabilizing the troubled A400M.
Programmes chief Didier Evrard, who led two of Europe's most ambitious projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, is due to retire this month and will be replaced by an internal candidate from services or engineering.

Some changes are happening already, with Airbus switching its quality-control chief this week after a series of snags.

The S&P 500 futures rose 2 points or 0.08% to 2,654.5 as of 6:40 AM ET (11:40 GMT) while Dow futures inched down 5 points, or 0.02%, to 24,561. Meanwhile tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures increased 15 points, or 0.23%, to 6,784.5.
The U.S. and China struck a trade truce earlier this month and have been in talks ever since, increasing hopes that the trade war between the two will soon be over.
Investor sentiment was bolstered by news that China made its first major purchase of soybeans in 6 months on Wednesday. Beijing had imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soy imports over the summer.
Markets have been rocky over the last few weeks over skepticism that little progress will be made on trade, which was increased by the arrest in Canada of a top executive from Huawei on an extradition request from the U.S.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Top German court rules Uber limousine service illegal,"By Ursula Knapp
KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's highest court ruled on Thursday that a defunct limousine service offered by Uber [UBER.UL] was illegal, in a setback for the U.S. ride-hailing company that has struggled to comply with the law in Europe's largest economy.
The Federal Court of Justice, handing down a final decision, upheld lower-court rulings in favor of a complaint brought by a Berlin taxi business that the so-called Uber Black service had violated German laws governing car rentals.
Responding to the judgment, Uber said it had taken Uber Black out of service in 2014, adding that the services it now operates in four German cities complied with the law.
""This ruling has no impact on our current services in Germany as we changed our operating model more than four years ago,"" the company said in a statement.
""We will continue to engage with local stakeholders as we develop services that address Germany's growing transportation needs and shape the future of urban mobility in a responsible way.""
Uber, which could fetch a valuation of $120 billion when it floats next year in what would be the biggest stock market listing by a tech startup, has had a series of run-ins with regulators, courts and drivers around the world.
In Britain, the company has fought a long-running court battle over whether its drivers should be given workers' rights, including a minimum wage. The company argues that drivers are self-employed.
In the German case, two lower courts had banned the Uber Black service based on the complaint brought by a Berlin taxi operator, Richard Leipold.
He had argued that its operations should be covered by laws covering car rentals. These require a car to return to its base after each trip and for trips to be awarded by a dispatcher.
Taxis, by contrast, can accept orders directly.
Uber now offers its services in four German cities - Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt and Duesseldorf - and says it is in full compliance with German laws.
Its Uber X service operates in partnership with car rental companies whose drivers hold a license to carry passengers, a company spokesman said. Its UberTaxi service functions as a regular taxi service.

Establishing an important principle, the Federal Court found that Uber was subject to German transportation laws, dismissing arguments that European Union rules governing the provision of services should apply.

Under the accord, Eletrobras will pay $14.75 million to holders of its American Depositary Shares (ADRs) as compensation for losses related to the company's involvement in a sprawling corruption scheme.
The settlement had been presented to the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York in June and received preliminary approval in August. 
In May, when Eletrobras reached a memorandum of understanding with ADR holders, the company said it was not admitting any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
In January, Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a similar U.S. class action lawsuit, in what was said to be the biggest such payout ever in the United States by a foreign entity.

Yields on 10-year government debt fell to the lowest level since September, consolidating below 3 percent, after Rome proposed to cut the shortfall to 2.04 percent of output, from the previous goal of 2.4 percent that was rejected by the EU. The country’s benchmark share index headed for a two-day gain of more than 3 percent.
Rome’s conciliatory stance is stoking optimism the EU will delay or temper any disciplinary action planned against Italy for its failure to comply with the bloc’s rules. The nation’s bonds offer the highest investment-grade yields in the euro area and are trading at a significant discount to where they started the year. Speculation about early elections may also help support the securities, according to  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
“Speculation about new elections and a budget compromise with the EU are supporting Italy sooner than we had anticipated,” Christoph Rieger, a rates strategist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients. “The momentum may well carry on near-term.”
Italian 10-year yields dropped six basis points to 2.94 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 27. The spread over those on German bonds was at 265 basis points.

291,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 03:23AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank stock surges after government looks at Commerzbank merger idea,"Deutsche Bank's difficult year may well end with some festive cheer after all.
The German government is increasing its efforts to aid Deutsche Bank with officials said to be looking at different ways the bank could merge with Commerzbank more easily. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Deutsche Bank's CEO Christian Sewing - appointed in April - are said to have discussed possibilities,  according to Bloomberg. 
Deutsche Bank shares rose as much as 8.5% on the news and are up 6.2% as of 4.50 p.m in London (11.50 EST) while Commerzbank rose 5.9%. 
The talks are said to have included conversations about changing existing laws to make the potential merger cheaper with a change to tax laws a possibility. Deutsche Bank could become a holding company to make a potential merger smoother although this could create a large tax burden on the lender if it's required to revalue assets. Making German tax legislation less disadvantageous to holding structures is among the topics discussed in the high-level talks. 
Deutsche Bank shares have fallen more than 50% in 2018, hitting record lows on numerous occasions. 
Takeover or merger talk is nothing new for Deutsche. Last month,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) CEO Michael Corbat  reportedly told German business publication Manager Magazin that there was too much ""overlap"" between Citigroup's and Deutsche Bank's businesses, and that a takeover based purely on cost savings wasn't a good idea.
A combined German lender is said to have been on the country's agenda for a while in an attempt to prevent the exodus of foreign capital from the economy and create a banking heavyweight. 
Deutsche Bank has been embroiled in scandals throughout 2018 and its Frankfurt headquarters were recently raided by the German public prosecutor's office as part of an investigation into the Panama Papers global money-laundering scandal.
Similarly, Deutsche Bank was last month named as the bank at the centre of a $150 billion money-laundering scandal centred on Danske Bank's operations in Estonia. It's alleged that Deutsche Bank processed a large chunk of money for Danske Bank from Russia into international markets via Tallinn between 2007 and 2015.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Commerzbank didn't immediately respond to enquiries. "

(Reuters) - U.S. solar installations fell 15 percent in the third quarter as the Trump administration's tariffs on overseas-made panels forced developers to put off large projects, according to a report commissioned by the industry's primary trade group.
Current weakness in the utility-scale market, however, will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever, the report said.
Quarterly installations of utility-scale solar were 678 megawatts, the lowest quarter since 2015 and a more than 30 percent decline from a year ago, the report by Wood Mackenzie for the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association said. The total market, which includes residential and commercial installations, came in at 1.7 gigawatts.
The slowdown is a shift for solar, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade. Through the first three quarters of the year, solar accounted for 30 percent of electricity generating capacity additions.
Large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the 30 percent tariffs as panels can account for up to half their costs.
Trump announced the levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline. Solar installers opposed the move because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels.
Most of the panels installed in the United States are made in Asia by companies including China's JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Canadian Solar Inc, and U.S.-based SunPower Corp.
Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2018 utility-scale forecast to 6.6 GW from 6.8 GW as more projects get pushed into 2019. 
The firm raised its forecasts for 2019 through 2023 by a combined 2.5 GW, however, as utilities procure projects that will qualify for a federal tax credit that begins to phase out in 2020. Developers will start projects next year but delay buying modules until 2020 or later because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year.
Sliding solar panel prices are also spurring demand from utilities. 
A move by China earlier this year to slash subsidies for solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices.

Solar energy system prices are at historical lows in all segments of the market, the report said. U.S. module prices are down more than 15 percent from a year ago.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Investors cut short positions on most Asian currencies; yuan bear bets at 21-month low: Reuters poll,"By Rushil Dutta
(Reuters) - Bearish bets on most Asian currencies fell over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates next year after a near certain hike next week.
Wagers on the yuan weakening declined by half as trade talks between Washington and Beijing gained traction. 
Short interests in the yuan were at the lowest level since March 2017, the poll of 11 respondents showed, as the local unit gallops toward its best monthly performance since January, firming over 1 percent so far this month.
The yuan is of late underpinned by a perceived improvement in Sino-U.S. trade relations, which have been strained much of this year and often exacerbated by verbal volleys exchanged between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump.
However, breaking from his usual stonewalling stance, Trump told earlier this week that talks were taking place with Beijing over phone and that he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he was sure about a deal.
He even offered to intervene in the Justice Department's case against the chief financial officer of telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, who was granted bail by a Canadian court earlier this week.
Meanwhile, a weakening in the dollar outlook also gave Asian currencies a lift. 
Although the dollar has gained over 5 percent so far this year on the back of Fed rate hikes, the recent softening of U.S. Treasury yields and lukewarm economic data have led some to forecast that the dollar may have hit a ceiling.
While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates next week, investors see barely one more hike next year. However, some banks such as JP Morgan expect as many as four hikes in 2019.
Bearish bets on the Singapore dollar  receded marginally, while those on the Indonesian rupiah  fell to their lowest since the beginning of May.
Short interests in the Korean won  fell to a more than one-year low, while those in its low-yielding peer the Taiwanese dollar  were at their lowest since May-end.
Meanwhile, bearish bets piled up on the Indian rupee  after a sharp decline two weeks ago, as investors digested the sudden resignation of the central bank governor, Urjit Patel, on Monday. Shaktikanta Das, an ex-finance ministry official, was swiftly placed in the top post.
Besides, data on Wednesday showed retail inflation rate dropped to a 17-month low in November, increasing chances the new RBI chief would hold rates at his first policy meeting.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee , Philippine peso , Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.

A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

300,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 01:22AM ET</span>","Japan's SoftBank to shun Huawei in favor of Ericsson, Nokia equipment: Nikkei","TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp plans to replace 4G network equipment from China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd with hardware from Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nikkei reported on Thursday, without citing sources.
The move comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Chinese tech firms by the United States and some prominent allies over ties to the Chinese government, driven by concerns they could be used by Beijing for spying. 
SoftBank, Japan's third-largest telco, will also order equipment for its next generation 5G network from the two European suppliers instead of Huawei, Nikkei reported. 
A SoftBank spokesman said the report was ""based on speculation and no decision has been made"".
Nokia and Ericsson are already big suppliers to SoftBank. 
It also has the longest running relationship with Huawei among Japan's top three telcos, but the firm has previously said that the amount of equipment it uses from Chinese makers ""is relatively small"". 
Replacing the 4G equipment, which Nikkei reported will be done over several years, is likely to be time-consuming and expensive, industry sources have said.
The Nikkei report on the supplier switch comes as SoftBank is preparing to list its telecoms unit in Tokyo on Dec. 19. 
This week, SoftBank's telecoms unit priced its IPO at an indicated 1,500 yen ($13.22) per share and said would sell an extra 160 million shares to meet demand, raising about $23.5 billion in Japan's biggest-ever IPO.
The report also comes on the heels of Japan issuing a policy document on maintaining cybersecurity during procurement.
While Huawei was not explicitly named, sources have said that the policy document was aimed at preventing government procurement from the company as well as China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
Huawei has already been locked out of the U.S. market, and Australia and New Zealand have blocked it from building 5G networks amid concerns of its possible links with China's government. Huawei has said Beijing has no influence over it.
Japan's decision to keep Huawei out would add to the woes of the firm, whose chief financial officer was recently arrested by Canadian officials for extradition to the United States.

The fall in prices came after short seller Bonitas Research accused the company of fabricating income and profitability, deeming Hengan’s equity “ultimately worthless.”
Hengan was suspended from trading for a day in the previous session. The company released a statement on Thursday refuting the allegation.
Bonita accused Hengan of fabricating RMB 11 billion (U.S.$1.6 billion) in net income since 2005 and claiming to achieve a return on sanitary napkin assets of 72% in 2016. Hengan described the accusation as “speculative and baseless.”
The value of the stock is ultimately zero because it has taken on a staggering amount of debt, Bonita said in the report.
Hengan contended that it accounts for 27% of the market share of sanitary napkin sales in China in 2017 and the first half of 2018. It said that it benefitted from early market entry and that its “broad customer base and effective cost control measures” help with the reported profit margin.
Bonitas alleged that Hengan “orchestrated [a scheme] using a web of inter-company related transactions to artificially inflate profits and conceal fake cash balances,” but the Chinese company argued that the intra-group trades between the subsidiaries are “genuine transactions.”"

Once operational, Hengli will become the country's first privately owned refinery and chemical complex. With a refining capacity of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, the site will rival the largest oil refineries in China, the world's biggest importer and second-largest consumer of oil. 
""Hengli has completed building the 20 million ton per year refinery and chemical complex, with public utilities and auxiliary facilities also ripe for operations,"" the firm said in a statement posted on its social media platform late on Wednesday.
Diesel fuel will first be injected into the pipes to run through the facilities, before crude oil is fed into the distillation tower about a week to 10 days later, said an industry source involved in the test operation. 
A total of 500,000 tonnes of Saudi crude oil will be used for experimental operations for about 20 days, said the source, who declined to be named as not authorized to speak to press.
It normally takes several months for a new refinery to begin stable operations after test runs. 
Hengli has agreed to buy 130,000 bpd of crude oil from state-owned Saudi Aramco under an annual supply agreement for 2019, becoming a new major customer for Saudi Arabia which competes with Russia for the top spot in oil sales to China.
Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp, controlled by private chemical group Rongsheng Holdings, is expected to start partial test operations at some units around end of this year and early 2019 at its similar-sized complex.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Wednesday warned the United States not to politicize extradition cases, a day after President Donald Trump said he could intervene in the affair of a Chinese executive detained in Canada at Washington's request.
Freeland also told reporters that a second Canadian citizen could be in trouble in China. Authorities in China are already holding former diplomat Michael Kovrig, who was detained on Monday.
Officials say China had so far not linked Kovrig's detention to the arrest in Vancouver on Dec. 1 of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, which infuriated Beijing. But Canadian diplomatic experts have said they have no doubt the two cases are linked.
U.S. prosecutors accuse Meng of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. She has said she is innocent.
Trump told Reuters on Tuesday he would intervene https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/trump-says-would-intervene-in-arrest-of-chinese-executive-idUSKBN1OB01P in the U.S. Justice Department's case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Freeland said it was obvious the legal process should not be hijacked for political purposes and that Meng's lawyers would have the option of raising Trump's remarks if they decided to fight extradition. 
""Our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice and following the rule of law,"" she said when asked about Trump's comments.
Her words mark another potentially difficult moment in ties between Canada and the United States, which were heavily strained during more than a year of talks to negotiate a new North American trade pact. 
Others also questioned whether Trump might be misusing the extradition request.
""This is a legal issue and one that appears properly executed but your comments can only diminish an important extradition agreement,"" said Bruce Heyman, an ex-U.S. ambassador to Canada who was appointed by President Barack Obama, Trump's predecessor.
Meng was released on bail by a Canadian court on Tuesday and is next due to appear before a judge on Feb. 6.
The United States has not yet made a formal extradition petition. Once it does, if a Canadian judge rules in favor of the request, Canada's justice minister must decide whether to extradite Meng to the United States.
Canadian government officials earlier told a briefing that Meng had many legal options to fight extradition and the process could take years.
The justice minister could deny the U.S. request if they deem ""it has been made for an improper purpose,"" said one official.
The Meng affair has soured Canada's ties with China at a time when Ottawa is trying to boost bilateral trade.
Freeland expressed deep concern over the Kovrig case and said a second unnamed man had called Canadian authorities to say Chinese officials were asking him questions.
""We have not been able to make contact with him since he let us know about this,"" she said.
""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we have also raised this case with the Chinese authorities.""
The government officials said they had seen an uptick in anti-Canadian sentiment online and in China and have communicated concerns about diplomatic staff safety to the Chinese government, which beefed up security in response.

""We have in general informed our personnel in Beijing and in our consulates to take extra precautions,"" an official said.

The ruling from the Miami-based tribunal, part of the International Chamber of Commerce, stems from a protracted dispute between the authority and a group of builders led by Spain's Sacyr (MC:SCYR) and Italy's Salini  Impregilo  (MI:SALI).
Under the dispute were cost overruns related to the construction of a third set of locks for the waterway, which was completed in 2016.
The canal authority said the sum of nearly $848 million accounted for advances that had been granted to the consortium, called GUPC, or Grupo Unidos por el Canal. The entity includes Belgium's Jan De Nul and Panama's Constructura Urbana.
Last year, the tribunal had rejected a demand by GUPC for $192.8 million to cover cost overruns.

307,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Huawei Troubles Spell Opportunity for Samsung as 5G Nears,"(Bloomberg) -- Growing security concerns surrounding Huawei Technologies Co. may help Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. challenge the Chinese behemoth in the market for fifth-generation wireless communications, an executive at the South Korean giant said.
While Samsung remains the world’s biggest smartphone and semiconductor maker, Huawei dominates networking by a large margin. But its market position is under threat as one country after another blocks the use of its 5G products, amid concerns they could be used to spy for the Chinese government. Huawei denies any role in espionage.
“Strategically these concerns help us grab more market share,” S. Abraham Kim, a vice president at Samsung’s mobile division, said Wednesday at a conference in Seoul. “Huawei has held dominance in the network market since the fourth-generation LTE era, but we’re ahead on 5G technology that goes into smartphones.”
Samsung said Kim’s personal views on the networks market don’t reflect those of the company as he is part of the mobile phone business.
“Samsung Electronics has been working in the networks industry for decades building trust with our partners,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our priority is working with our partners across the world to unlock the power of 5G. That is why we have made substantial investments in 5G technology since the mid 2000s.”
Samsung plans to release a 5G-capable handset along with a bendable-screen phone next year, and sees those gadgets as its best shot at reviving sales that have slowed as consumers wait longer to upgrade their smartphones.
But technical challenges remain, Kim said. 5G signals can get obstructed depending on how a phone is held, so that means the need to cram more antenna modules around a phone’s already limited real estate, alongside a large battery. Samsung is now studying how a device’s innards can be split into two layers while still minimizing overall thickness, Kim said.
Heat poses another challenge because 5G transmits a lot more data and consumes more power, potentially making the phone too hot to hold. Samsung is working to cap the temperature at just over 40 degrees Celsius, Kim said.
Huawei recently replaced Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). to become the world’s second-biggest smartphone maker and is narrowing the gap with Samsung. But concerns about the Chinese company’s global business have escalated since Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested on allegations she conspired to defraud banks and violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng was released on bail Tuesday but faces extradition to the U.S.
"
308,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 10:38PM ET</span>","Chinese state media urges Canada to defy U.S., free Huawei executive","SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Canada should distance itself from U.S. ""hegemonism"" and grant unconditional freedom to Meng Wanzhou, a top executive of China's Huawei detained in Vancouver on Washington's request, state-owned tabloid Global Times said in a Thursday editorial.
Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating sanctions. She was arrested on Dec. 1 and released on bail on Tuesday.
The United States needs to make a formal extradition request within 60 days of her arrest, which a Canadian judge will weigh to determine whether the case against Meng is strong enough. Then it is up to Canada's justice minister to decide whether to extradite her.
Meng has no criminal record anywhere in the world and her arrest violates a U.S.-Canada extradition agreement, the Global Times said, adding that Canada could end the crisis immediately by freeing Meng unconditionally, rather than acting as the ""51st state"" of the United States. 
""Canada should distance itself from U.S. hegemonism and fulfill its obligations to help maintain international order and protect human rights,"" it said. 
Even before the arrest, pressure from the United States has been forcing Huawei on to the back foot in telecom markets. 
Washington has long expressed worries that Huawei's ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells a security risk.
Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, has repeatedly denied accusations that it facilitates Chinese espionage.
""I am proud of Huawei, I am proud of my motherland,"" Meng said in a post on Chinese social media after her release. 
Meng's arrest and Huawei's struggle to allay security fears have triggered a wave of sympathy on Chinese social media. 
""She has a strong motherland at her back,"" wrote one user on the Twitter-like Weibo. 
DETAINED CANADIAN
Authorities in China are holding former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig on suspicion of engaging in activities harmful to national security. He was detained on Monday. 
The Global Times said there was no evidence Kovrig's arrest was in any way connected to the case, but added, ""the assumption is because Canada has gone too far and people naturally believe China will retaliate"".
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland warned the United States on Wednesday not to politicize extradition cases, a day after President Donald Trump said he would intervene in the case if it served national security interests.
In another editorial on Thursday, the official China Daily newspaper accused the United States of manufacturing the diplomatic incident in order to serve political ends.

""Washington is mistaken if it thinks it can take Meng hostage and ransom her for concessions in the upcoming trade talks,"" it said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Insurance claims from the recent spate of California wildfires, including one ranked as the most deadly and destructive in state history, have topped $9 billion and are expected to grow, the state insurance commissioner reported on Wednesday.
The claims, so far, fall short of the record $12 billion in wildfire-related insured losses sustained in California in 2017, most of that from more than a dozen blazes that swept a large swath of wine country north of San Francisco Bay, killing 46 people.
This year, the Camp Fire that erupted on Nov. 8 has accounted for the bulk of the claims, just over $7 billion of the total. The wind-driven blaze quickly incinerated most of the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, destroying 18,500 homes and businesses and killing 86 people. 
The casualty toll stands as the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire on record in California, and the highest from any U.S. wildfire during the past century.
A pair of smaller blazes that broke out at about the same time in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, the Woolsey and Hill fires, killed three people and destroyed some 1,500 structures and forced the evacuation of thousands in the Malibu area west of Los Angeles.
The insurance commissioner put preliminary insurance claims from those two fires combined at more than $2 billion, bringing the total for all three of last month's blazes to $9.05 billion. 
The tally reflects losses for residential and commercial coverage, as well as for motor vehicles, agriculture, machinery and other assets, the Insurance Department said.
""The devastating wildfires of 2018 were the deadliest and most destructive wildfire catastrophes in California's history,"" Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement.
The numbers released on Wednesday stem from almost 40,000 separate claims, more than a fourth of which represent total losses. Most of those, 10,564, were for personal residential property, the commissioner said.
But the figures do not include billions of dollars in potential losses faced by Pacific Gas & Electric Company in the event the utility's electrical equipment is ultimately found to have caused the Camp Fire. PG&E Corp has said its liability could exceed its insurance coverage if that happens.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts have projected the company's potential exposure from the blaze could exceed $15 billion.

Citing two people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Beijing may delay the “Made in China 2025” plan by a decade to 2035.
The news came after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David Malpass urged China to do more to end the tariff war.
“What you will see, if we do get to a trade agreement with China, is there will be verification procedures, there will be enforcement mechanisms,” Ross said on CNBC television. “We’re talking about some fairly fundamental structural changes that over time will be needed to accomplish at least our end purposes.”
The Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Composite jumped 1.6% and 1.9% respectively by 9:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 1.5%.
Meanwhile, Citi said in a report on Tuesday that China will likely speed up its Belt and Road projects amid tension with the U.S.
China will likely ""escalate the loan and shorten the project approval"" process to quicken the pace of infrastructure building ""so as to diversify trade and economic activities there away from the U.S.,"" Citi analysts said in the report.
""We believe the BRI will primarily benefit the railway sector, given China's distinct advantages globally in terms of technology and cost in railway infrastructure,"" they said.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.6%.  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said in a statement that it is planning to provide funding worth 1.7 trillion won ($1.5 billion) to stabilise management of its suppliers.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.0%, while Australia’s ASX 200 traded 0.4% higher.
In other news, the Brexit sage remained in focus as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party. May won the leadership challenge by 200 votes to 117 votes against her in the ballot of Conservative members of parliament (MPs).
""The fact remains that the EU is highly unlikely to offer the reassurance MPs are demanding on the Irish backstop,"" analysts at ING said, adding there was a risk that a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal will not take place until later in the first quarter of 2019.
""In the meantime, the lack of clarity and elevated risk of 'no deal' is set to see economic activity slow further,"" they said.
May called off Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal so she could go back to Brussels and ask for changes to it. Reports on Tuesday said one of May's spokespeople noted that the House vote on May's Brexit deal could be postponed for up to six weeks.
Questions about May's future arrived as she made little progress convincing lawmakers in Brussels to amend the terms of her Brexit deal, increasing the prospect of another referendum, or an extension of Article 50, which was triggered in March last year, setting into motion Britain's departure from the European Union.
The British pound jumped about 1% on Wednesday following the news. The GBP/USD pair last traded at 1.2618, down 0.1%.

Ahead of its annual general meeting next week, ANZ said Fred Ohlsson is leaving his current post and taking an extended period of unpaid leave to return to his native Sweden with his family.
He is one of the many executives to depart at Australia's ""Big Four"" banks this year, some of whom were prompted to leave following revelations of misconduct at a semi-judicial inquiry, including the head of wealth management at National Australia Bank (AX:NAB).
Mark Hand, the head of ANZ's business and private banking, will take Ohlsson's role, the bank said.

The bank was accused in June of criminal cartel conduct over a A$3 billion stock issue, in a landmark case being watched around the world.

313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>","Hitachi, ABB Confirm Talks on Potential Deal on Power Grids","(Bloomberg) -- ABB Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. said they are in talks for a deal on power grids after the Swiss engineering giant was reported to be considering putting the division on the block earlier this year.
ABB is in discussions with Hitachi to expand and re-define an existing strategic power-grid partnership between the two companies that dates to 2014, it said in a statement Wednesday. Hitachi made a similar statement after trading hours in Tokyo. It’s the first time either has commented on a potential transaction.
Nikkei reported Wednesday that the Japanese conglomerate is preparing to buy the business for as much as 800 billion yen ($7 billion). An agreement could be reached as early as this month after a final assessment, the newspaper said in a later update Thursday, after earlier saying it could be this week.
Hitachi shares declined 0.7 percent Thursday in Tokyo, after jumping as much as 2.4 percent in early trading. ABB rose 4 percent in Zurich trading Wednesday, the most in almost eight months, giving it a market value of about $43 billion.
A move by Hitachi to buy ABB’s power grids business would boost its position in the growing power transmission and distribution sector, and help it diversify away from its nuclear plant business. Chief Executive Officer Toshiaki Higashihara has been restructuring the diversified company by spinning off some assets. The company is vying to become one of the top grid companies in the world, according to a June presentation.
Considering Sale
Hitachi’s atomic reactor sales have dried up as the global nuclear industry is beset by overruns, heightened competition from natural gas and renewables, and stricter rules following the Fukushima disaster.
ABB was considering the sale of the power-grid business and discussing options with advisers, Bloomberg News reported in August. The division’s implied valuation was more than $10 billion following productivity and margin gains, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis the same month. The Financial Times reported last month that the unit was worth about $13 billion, citing analysts.
In Stages
ABB plans to spin off the unit into a separate company, Nikkei said Thursday. Hitachi aims to invest in this entity in stages and eventually make it a wholly owned subsidiary to help mitigate risks from changes in the business environment, it said. In its report late Wednesday, Nikkei had said Hitachi is expected to initially take a stake of about 50 percent before turning it into a subsidiary.
The sale of the business that makes power transformers, long distance electricity-transmission systems and energy storage units would shrink ABB by about a quarter. It would also vindicate activist Cevian Capital AB, which has been pushing for a breakup of the company for years and particularly a separation of that division. After conducting a strategic review, Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Spiesshofer defied the investor in 2016 by deciding to hang on to the laggard unit.
‘Cast in Stone’
The power grids business is worth “much, much more today” than the $4 billion to $5 billion valuation that it was given in 2016, Spiesshofer told analysts in July, arguing that it was a good decision to have kept it in the portfolio. He simultaneously signaled a willingness to separate from the business, saying ABB’s portfolio isn’t “cast in stone.”
ABB’s most recent quarterly results published in October fell short of expectations as demand for industrial equipment slowed in the Middle East and the U.K. and an overhaul of power grids remained a work in progress.
The profit margin widened at the division to 10 percent, just enough to reach the bottom end of a goal, but significantly below that of the company’s other three businesses."

Miners including BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT),  Glencore  (L:GLEN),  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and Peabody Energy (N:BTU) use Aurizon's four major railways in the state of Queensland to bring coal to port.
Protracted negotiations over pay rises and rostering had broken down, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, which represents train crews and maintenance workers at Aurizon, said in a statement on Thursday.
""Members ... will start walking off the job at midday tomorrow in 11 days of action,"" the union said. Four days of stoppages and seven days of overtime bans are planned. 
Aurizon said in a statement that if the strikes go ahead, its Blackwater and Moura networks would shut for 24 hours from noon on Friday. 
Its Goonyella and Newlands lines would close for 24 hours from noon on Saturday and its corridor into Brisbane would shut from noon on Monday for 24 hours.
The lines connect the coal-rich Bowen Basin with ports on Australia's east coast.
""Aurizon has been bargaining in good faith (and) believes solid and constructive progress was being made,"" Aurizon said in a statement.
""Aurizon is urging the unions to withdraw their proposed industrial action. It is extremely disappointing that unions have elected to take this unnecessary and premature step.""
Aurizon shares had risen 0.8 percent by mid-morning, while the broader market rose 0.3 percent.

According to the document, seen by Reuters, the court decided on Wednesday that the ousted chairman - indicted this week for financial wrongdoing - and his daughter should have the right to access the apartment to retrieve personal belongings.
Nissan said that ruling was irrelevant given an earlier decision by a higher court overturning that decision.
""Since there is still a decision in a higher court upholding Nissan's existing request, the current situation is that Ghosn's representatives are not entitled to enter the apartment,"" Nissan spokesman Nicholas Maxfield said. 
Ghosn and Nissan have battled and appealed several times over the beachfront apartment, which he used while working for the carmaker, since he was accused of financial wrongdoing last month.
At the center of the dispute is Nissan's claim that the apartment contains three safes that the carmaker says it found there. Nissan says it has not opened the safes but that they may contain evidence against Ghosn, which could be lost if people close to him gained access to the apartment.
The document seen by Reuters showed the court allowing Ghosn and his daughter Caroline, who recently traveled to Brazil, to retrieve personal belongings such as ""clothes, photos, books, watches, jewelry, documents"".
To retrieve the items, representatives for Ghosn will have to go accompanied by two judicial officers, the decision says. 
Ghosn has been in detention in Tokyo since his Nov. 19 arrest for allegedly underreporting his income.

A representative for the Ghosn family in the United States did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) said on Wednesday it would review a ruling that a ban on imports of some iPhones into the United States was not in the public interest, even if Apple Inc (O:AAPL) infringed a Qualcomm (O:QCOM) patent.
Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.
Qualcomm initiated the ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel (O:INTC) chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.
Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does. It later dropped three of the six patents from the case.
Administrative law judge Thomas Pender, a now-retired member of the ITC tribunal that hears patent infringement cases, ruled in September that Apple infringed one of the patents, but cleared the company of infringing the other two.
Pender recommended the agency not grant Qualcomm the relief the San Diego, California-based chipmaker had sought, saying it was not in the U.S. interest.
The ITC said on Wednesday it would review whether the one patent was indeed infringed and also whether it was right to not grant Qualcomm relief. Pender's decision on the other two patents would not be reviewed, it said.
The agency would also consider how long it would take Apple to design around Qualcomm's patented battery-saving technology, what national security concerns would be implicated by an sales ban and whether a limited import ban could be adopted, it said.
""We are pleased that the Commission is going to review the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation that no ITC remedy should result from a finding of infringement,"" Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement after the announcement. 
Apple declined to comment. 

A final ruling is due before February 19, the ITC said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Yumiko Okubo, 71, had forgotten how to heat up food.
""What's a microwave?"" she asked her husband, Eiichi. 
Yumiko was in the early stages of dementia, struggling with vocabulary and unable to teach the kimono-dressing classes she had run for 25 years.
The difficulty with everyday tasks has made life challenging for her and Eiichi, who has been caring for her since 2008.
But she is also unable to deal with her finances - a situation that experts say is increasingly common in fast-ageing Japan and that puts trillions of yen worth of assets at risk.
Rika Kambayashi, a social worker in Kyoto, says she has seen many cases of dementia patients withdrawing large sums without a clear grasp of what they are doing or why.
In one example, she said, a woman in her 90s withdrew 20 million yen ($266,000) of her savings at a grandson's urging.
""She was saying she withdrew nine or ten. It took me a while to realize she was talking about a number of banknote rolls,"" Kambayashi said. A roll is typically one hundred 10,000 yen notes. ""It was clearly a case of abuse.""
Dementia has been diagnosed in more than 5 million Japanese. The government estimates that number will increase to 7 million to 8 million, or 6 to 7 percent of the total population, by 2030. 
The OECD has a somewhat lower estimate that dementia will affect 3.8 percent of Japan's population by 2037, still the highest among the 35 OECD states and far above the average of 2.3 percent predicted for the group.
Japanese with dementia will hold about 215 trillion yen ($2 trillion) in financial assets by 2030, compared with 143 trillion yen now, according to estimates by Dai-ichi Life Research.
Many companies now face risks in doing business with people with dementia, whose families may return later to ask that the transaction be canceled, said Jin Narumoto, professor of psychiatry at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.
A survey by Narumoto and three other researchers found about 30 percent of dementia patients and families have experienced financial losses because of the condition.
Bank officials say tellers now regularly encounter people with dementia who cannot use an ATM or who repeatedly ask the same questions. Some behave strangely, accuse employees of theft or even become violent. 
Dementia is closely linked to age, and by 2030, about 31 percent of Japan's population is projected to be 65 or older. As the country's life expectancy is 84 years, the highest in the world, the problem of dementia will only intensify.
REGULAR ENCOUNTERS
Dementia is caused by several diseases, with Alzheimer's accounting for about two-thirds. It covers a range of symptoms, broadly defined as a decline in memory and thinking serious enough to hamper daily life.
Patients gradually lose their ability to count, tell time, or recognize places and people, including close relatives. There's no known cure, although there are medications to slow the condition's progress.
As banks encounter more customers dealing with dementia, many, such as Nomura and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, are educating staff about how to safely and fairly handle interactions.
""In the past, teller staff have been dealing with each case ad-hoc. But it is important they sit together with people with medical background and learn about dementia,"" said Masaru Mimura, professor at neuropsychiatry at Keio University in Tokyo.
In Tokyo, five shinkins, or cooperative financial institutions, jointly set up a non-profit called Shinkin Seinenkouken Support to offer low-cost financial guardian services for people with dementia, working closely with a local government.
Guardians are appointed by a local court and help their clients professionally manage finances. They can act on behalf of their clients and even cancel contracts or purchases if needed.
Perhaps most important, they help families learn to cope with the ailment, introducing them to social welfare services.
But such systems have been prone to abuse. From 2010-2015, there were almost 3,000 reported cases of misuse, with 21 billion yen stolen by guardians, and many experts say there is little oversight. 
To address that, Shinkin Support assigns two guardians for each customer. It also conducts regular staff audits, much as banks do.
""Because we assign two people, our cost is twice as much as others. But we think that is a cost we need to pay,"" said Hitoshi Hiramori, director of Shinkin Seinenkouken Support. ""We think of this more as community service.""
Several other banks offer products that allow guardians only limited access for daily use, to prevent embezzlement. 
Other organizations hope technology will provide a solution.
 Money Forward  (T:3994), a fintech company that offers bookkeeping and financial management services, is developing an app-based warning system for suspicious transactions.
If someone who rarely withdraws money suddenly goes to an ATM seven times in one day, for instance - a possible sign their memory could be impaired - the app can alert the person's family, said Toshio Taki, board director of the firm.
For the Okubos, such assistance would help reduce some of the stress of everyday life - and help the couple focus on the normalcy that remains. 
""Even after she stopped using a wallet by herself, she still could do other things completely fine, like taking pictures or walking,"" Eiichi Okubo said, reminiscing about 500-kilometre hikes they took in 2012 and 2014. ""All my friends today are people who I came to know after Yumiko's dementia. So I feel I owe myself to her.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - With many rival airlines scaling back plans to add travel routes and seats in a bid to protect margins, Oscar Munoz is taking United Airlines in a different direction.
The No. 3 U.S. air carrier is forging ahead with a strategy to boost its flight network by another 4 percent to 6 percent next year after an estimated 5 percent network growth in 2018, Munoz, CEO of United Airlines since 2015, said on Wednesday. 
The growth plan has allowed United to claw back market share in a competitive U.S. airline sector and boost its profitability. Traditionally capacity growth in the airline business has come at a cost to yields because it can drive down fares.
So far, United has bucked the industry trend, increasing unit revenues - a closely watched metric that compares airlines' sales to available seat miles - at a faster pace than rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL). 
When the airline unveiled an aggressive plan to add capacity in the middle of a price war with low cost carriers in January, the stock of parent company United Continental Holdings (N:UAL) fell 7 percent. 
But United investors have more than reversed course, sending its shares up about 30 percent so far this year against a roughly 2 percent drop on the S&P 500.
United has overhauled its hubs in Chicago, Houston, Denver, Newark, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco with 220 new flights and better coast-to-coast connecting options.
(For graphic on U.S. domestic market share, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SLzKcA)
Munoz offered new details to his growth strategy on Wednesday, saying United will add flights to New Delhi, Toronto and Melbourne from San Francisco to tap higher-paying international routes.
""The strategy is working,"" Munoz told journalists.
The expansion comes after United revamped its home base - Chicago O'Hare Airport - in a way that allows passengers to make easier connections when traveling to the two U.S. coasts and cities in between.
A similar overhaul at Denver, its fastest growing and most profitable hub despite heavy competition from low-cost carriers Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and Frontier Airlines, will be launched in February. San Francisco is now set for its largest international route expansion, subject to government approval.
Much of United's domestic expansion so far has targeted a portion of the market share lost when the airline cut 1,200 flights following its post-bankruptcy merger with Continental Airlines in 2010.
""It's not predicated on anything other than where does it make sense for us to fly. Where are the customers? Do we have the right aircraft, and in essence, can you make money?"" Munoz told Reuters in an interview. ""We're not chasing that 1,200.""
The growth plans and investor optimism have allowed Munoz to put the passenger and animal scandals of 2017 in the rear view mirror, and focus on improving relations with its own passengers and labor force.
To turn around its image, Munoz has provided ""compassion"" training to employees and empowered flight attendants and gate agents to resolve passenger complaints on the spot with travel credits or vouchers. 

""United's No. 1 challenge is to avoid any more notable public relations disasters. Customers, investors and Twitter users will not forgive as easily the next time,"" Jim Corridore, equity analyst at CFRA in New York.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 06:06PM ET</span>","North America to weigh on Under Armour's 2019 revenue growth, shares slide","(Reuters) - Sportswear maker  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) on Wednesday forecast 2019 revenue growth and profit below Wall Street estimates on expectations of flat sales in North America, triggering a 11 percent drop in its shares.
The company has been struggling to gain market share in the United States, its biggest revenue source, due to fierce competition from  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn).
Under Armour's earnings forecast of 31 cents to 33 cents per share fell short of analysts' estimate, reflecting the company's struggle to turn around its North America business. Analysts are expecting the company to post a profit of 35 cents per share in 2019.
The Baltimore, Maryland-based sportswear maker also said it expects revenue to grow between 3 percent and 4 percent in 2019, while analysts were expecting a 5 percent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's forecast indicates that a turnaround is still far away, B Riley's Susan Anderson said.
Addressing investors at its headquarters on Wednesday, the company said it expected 2018 gross margin to be flat, compared with its earlier projection of ""flat to down slightly.""
It also forecast compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to be up low single digits in North America between 2020 and 2022, mid-teens in EMEA, low double digits in Latin America and mid-20s in Asia Pacific.
The Hovr smart-shoe maker said it expected to return to a low double-digit revenue growth by 2023. 
Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon said Under Armour's 2023 outlook suggested that earnings growth would likely occur toward the second half of the five-year forecast period, calculating a midpoint revenue CAGR of 7.2 percent.
""We would welcome having more confidence in the company's ability to hit these targets, however, not seeing the company's innovation or the depth of its pipeline prohibits us from changing a critical pillar of our thesis,"" Lyon said, reiterating his ""sell"" rating on the stock.
Under Armour's annual sales growth has slowed in the past few years and full-year profit has fallen below estimates in two out of the past five quarters.
Despite Wednesday's fall, Under Armour's Class A shares are still up 37.3 percent for the year. 

""It is clear (Under Armour) is no longer the growth company it was years ago,"" Lyon said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) plans to boost the number of external board members and set up a committee to oversee compensation as part of its effort to improve governance following the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn for financial misconduct, a source said.
Critics have said Nissan lacked adequate governance, with few truly independent voices on the board capable of questioning Ghosn and looking out for regular shareholders’ interests.
The company has not yet decided how many more external board seats to add, according to the source, who has knowledge of the matter but requested anonymity as the talks are still confidential.
The current three external board members include retired  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) executive Jean-Baptiste Duzan, considered to represent the views of the French automaker which is Nissan’s biggest shareholder. The other two external board members are former bureaucrat Masakazu Toyoda and racing car driver Keiko Ihara. 
Ghosn was indicted on Monday under-reporting his income. The company also cited multiple instances of financial misconduct including personal use of company assets. 
Ghosn's detention has left the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi auto alliance without its leader.

Nissan is 43.4 percent owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm. Renault’s biggest shareholder is the French state with 15 percent.

1. Costco Reports; Starbucks Holds Investor Day
On the earnings calendar tomorrow the big names are reporting after the bell, again.
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which everyone treats like a retailer, will issue its results, with analysts expecting a profit of $1.62 per share on sales of around $34.5 billion.
Costco revealed in a preliminary update last week that comparable sales rose 8.8% in its fiscal first quarter. Membership renewal metrics like subscriber renewal rates and overall membership income will likely draw in the bulk of investor attention.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will also report, with the Street looking for earnings of $1.89 per share on sales of about $2.4 billion.
And after Under Armour's (NYSE:UA) big drop today after its investor day update, investors may be paying more attention to those kind of events for headlines. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) hold investor days tomorrow.
2. Jobless Claims Decline Expected
The weekly jobless claims numbers will likely be the focus of tomorrow’s economic indicators and arrive at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that claims for first-time unemployment benefits fell slightly to 226,000.
The latest figures on import and export prices arrive at the same time.
The import price index is forecast to have fallen 1% in November, with export prices down 0.1%.
3. ECB Rate Decision on Tap; May Survives UK Leadership Challenge
Those watching the stock index futures action before the bell will know that European events can quickly change the narrative on Wall Street.
Investors will continue to look at developments on Brexit after UK Prime Minister Theresa May survived a party vote of no confidence late today.
In addition, the ECB will announce its interest rate decision at 7:45 AM ET (12:45 GMT). No change is expected, but there may be more for traders to digest at the press conference at 8:30 AM ET.
And it’s not just stock traders who will be watching. The bullish case for gold of late is pointing to instability and slowing growth in Europe as reason to hold the precious metal.
""Some economists over the pond have been quietly starting to use the word 'recession',"" Walter Pehowich, executive vice-president at Dillon Gage Metals in Addison, Texas, said."

336,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Crypto startup AriseBank settles fraud accusations with SEC,"(Reuters) - Cryptocurrency startup AriseBank will pay $2.3 million to the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle accusations of defrauding investors through claims such as building a cryptocurrency bank.
AriseBank founders Jared Rice and Stanley Ford will pay civil penalties of $184,767 each and will be prohibited from serving as officers of public companies or participating in offerings of digital securities, the SEC said in a statement.
The company is one of the first to be sued by U.S. regulators over its initial coin offering. 
Earlier this year, the SEC had halted what it alleged was a fraudulent initial coin offering by AriseBank to raise $1 billion for its ""AriseCoin"" cryptocurrency, which was considered one of the largest initial coin offerings ever.
The SEC had said it obtained a court order to halt AriseBank's efforts to target investors, alleging that the entity had ""falsely stated that it purchased an FDIC-insured bank"" and had ""omitted to disclose the criminal background of key executives.""

The court had also ordered the freezing of AriseBank's assets, while approving the appointment of a receiver for those assets tied to the ICO fraud.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",India did not let Russian-owned refinery buy Iranian oil: Iran minister,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday that, because of U.S. sanctions, India had refused to allow a Russian-owned Indian refinery to use Iranian crude oil that India had obtained under waivers.
Zanganeh was responding to a question in an interview on Iranian state television about why Iran had not bought refineries overseas. He said large investments were needed, and the refineries would be under the jurisdiction of the host country. 
""Even if you own a refinery, ...it is under the sovereignty of the country where it is located.... For example, a Russian company has bought the Essar refinery in India. But it is not allowed to take oil from Iran,"" Zanganeh said.
""The Indian government had obtained a waiver (to import Iranian oil) but it uses it for its state refinery. It did not allow them (Russians) to take oil,"" Zanganeh said.
Indian officials could not be contacted for comment, following the late evening interview.
Russian oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN), fund UCP and Swiss commodities trader Trafigura bought Essar Oil's large refinery, 3,500 fuel stations and infrastructure for $12.9 billion last year. 
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil industry last month.
Washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero, but fearing a crude oil price spike, it granted Iran's biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - sanctions waivers.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","Barrick, Tanzania make progress in tax row, no deal yet: source","By Zandi Shabalala and Susan Taylor
JOHANNESBURG/TORONTO (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp has made progress in talks with the Tanzanian government to resolve a nearly 2-year-long tax dispute, but it is premature to say a deal has been reached, a person familiar in the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Government officials met last week with executives from Toronto-based Barrick and  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd, which Barrick is acquiring, to discuss the issue, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.
Acacia Mining, 63.9 percent owned by Barrick, is operating under a raw mineral export ban and faces a $190 billion tax bill from the Tanzania government.
That meeting ""appears to have gone well,"" but there is ""nothing in writing,"" said the source. ""The next week is crucial.""
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Barrick had reached an agreement with the government on a $300 million payment, which Acacia will make in installments, with terms under review by a Tanzanian tax working group. It was unclear if the payment resolved outstanding tax issues.
Barrick, Randgold and Acacia declined to comment.
Any agreement requires approval by Acacia's board of directors and shareholders. Tanzanian President John Magufuli, who has pledged to secure a bigger share of resource wealth and cut corruption, may also review the deal.
Under an October 2017 framework pact that has yet to be implemented, Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton and Magufuli agreed that Acacia would pay the government $300 million, give it 16 percent ownership and split the economic benefits of its mines.
Randgold founder Mark Bristow, who is set to be the chief executive of Barrick after the merger closes in early 2019, has said he planned to intervene before the takeover closed and was confident he could break the impasse.
""If the deal with the Tanzanian government goes through, we believe this would be a win for Mr. Bristow even before he officially takes the reins,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Fahad Tariq in a note on Wednesday.
It would also ""make investors more confident in his ability to resolve other issues in the region (i.e. negotiating with the Congolese and Zambian governments on revised mining codes), in our view."" 
Bristow also told Reuters he wanted to pull together Tanzania's mining industry to address the increasingly acrimonious dispute. 
Acacia also faces dozens of criminal charges, from tax evasion to money laundering.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",China's Tencent Music debut strikes a chord with investors,"By Mary Ann Alapatt and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) - Shares of China-based music streaming company  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (N:TME) rose in their U.S. debut on Wednesday, as investors shrugged off volatile markets to grab a piece of the fast-growing music streaming industry.
The company's shares opened at $14.10, or 8.5 percent above their initial public offering price of $13 per share, giving Tencent a market capitalization of about $23 billion - on par with Swedish peer  Spotify Technology  SA's (N:SPOT) current valuation. Spotify is an investor in the Chinese company.
At 3:10 p.m. ET (2010 GMT), the stock was up around 7.5 percent at $13.98 and had risen as much as 13.5 percent from its IPO price.
The IPO raised $1.1 billion in proceeds and is one of the largest by a Chinese company in the United States this year, behind the $2.4 billion raised by video streaming company iQiyi Inc (O:IQ), the $1.6 billion garnered by online group discounter  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD) and the $1.15 billion by electric vehicle maker  NIO Inc  (N:NIO).
The debut marks an end to a tumultuous listing journey that saw the company delay its IPO plans until November in a market weakened by trade tensions between the United States and China.
""We are very proud to be able to complete the IPO despite the challenging market,"" Chief Strategy Officer Tony Yip said in a telephone interview. ""Raising over $1 billion in this type environment is not an easy task.""
Tencent Music finally launched its hotly anticipated IPO a day after U.S. and Chinese leaders brokered a 90-day truce in their trade conflict last week.
Buoyed by renewed talks between Washington and Beijing, ride-hailing rivals Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft have also charged ahead with their IPO filings, aimed at a 2019 listing. 
""If this (Tencent Music's) IPO came out at a different time, without the geopolitical risk that is currently in the market, we would have seen a much different result in terms of Tencent Music's pricing,"" said Jeff Zell, senior research analyst and partner at IPO Boutique, an IPO tracking firm.
The company, whose controlling shareholder is Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), priced its IPO at the lower end of its $13 to $15 pricing range on Tuesday.
Overall, the U.S. IPO market this year is also seeing its best year since 2014, with 208 IPOs raising $52.7 billion year-to-date even as market volatility and a broader market sell-off led to a slowdown in the current quarter, said audit and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
""Strong companies often choose to go public despite difficult market conditions and historically that has been a rewarding opportunity for investors,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Spotify, the company's closest rival, rose nearly 33 percent after its IPO, only to give up most of those gains over the last three months. Biotech company  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), which debuted last week, priced toward the lower end of its range on a day when the wider stock market fell on renewed trade concerns.
""It's hard to market time an IPO because there is so much that goes in to get an IPO launched that you just have to set the course and hold to it unless there is an absolute collapse in the market,"" said Benjamin Howe, chief executive officer of AGC Partners, a global boutique investment bank based in Boston.
Tencent Music claims more than 800 million monthly active users and offers online music, online karaoke and music-centric live streaming services. It said it has a music content library with over 20 million tracks as of Sept. 30.
Online music services contributed about 30 percent to its total revenue in the first nine months of the year, while music-centric social entertainment services, which include virtual gifts and premium memberships, accounted for more than 70 percent of the $1.65 billion in revenue it had in 2017, the company said in a filing.
Its profit more than tripled to $394 million for the first nine months of the year. By comparison, Spotify posted a net loss of $520 million over the first nine months of the year.
Spotify's shares were up 0.7 percent at $129.31.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks were up 1 percent on Wednesday afternoon, though well below their session highs, as investors were hopeful about U.S.-China trade relations after the latest comments from both sides and eyed some reassuring signs in British politics. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, in an interview with Reuters, said trade talks were under way with China. Traders said China made the first major purchase of U.S. soybeans since Washington and Beijing agreed to a temporary trade truce earlier this month.
Also, Trump said he would intervene in a case against a top executive at Huawei Technologies if it would help secure a trade deal.
The China news helped Wall Street, along with expectations Britain's Prime Minister might keep her job for now.
The S&P pared gains as the day wore on as investors were cautious about the rally's sustainability. But they found some technical reassurance as stocks have recently bounced back multiple times intraday after testing 2018 lows.
""We've had numerous retests of those lows. Each retest makes the support stronger,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Sterling in Austin, Texas. ""We know where the likely floor is. There's some comfort in the market based on that belief."" 
But Phipps cautioned that while the market might stay above the 2018 lows it would likely continue to be volatile at least until a U.S.-China negotiating deadline at the end of February.
""Not only is Trump unlikely to seal a deal until the end of February but the rhetoric gets more abrasive the closer he gets to the deadline,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political issues that are going to keep pressure on the market from now to the end of February."" 
At 3:13 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 305.22 points, or 1.25 percent, to 24,675.46, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 31.8 points, or 1.21 percent, to 2,668.58 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 114.04 points, or 1.62 percent, to 7,145.87. 
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors 9 were in positive territory with 8 showing gains of around 1 percent or more. The real estate sector <.SPLRCR> was the biggest loser with a 1.4 percent drop while utilities (SPLRCU) followed with a 0.4 percent decline, showing a lack of appetite for defensive sectors. 
The S&P technology sector (SPLRCT) gained 1.6 percent, providing the biggest support to the benchmark. The sector is heavily exposed to China trade.
Trading has been especially choppy in the past few days amid a slew of headlines on topics ranging from China trade and a potential U.S. government shutdown to uncertainty around Britain's divorce from the European Union. 
After British Prime Minister Theresa May struggled to reach an exit deal this weak investors contemplated the possibility of a disorderly ""no-deal"" departure or another referendum. 
May promised on Wednesday to step down before the next parliamentary election due in 2022, hoping to win over wavering lawmakers before a no-confidence vote triggered by Brexit supporters.
China-based music streaming company Tencent Music Entertainment (N:TME) was last up 7.9 percent in its U.S. debut.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday voted to open a new review of U.S. media ownership rules and seek comments on whether the government should end a prohibition on mergers among the four largest broadcast networks.
The FCC said it could reverse the rule that bars a merger among the ""Big Four"" networks: NBC, owned by Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) ABC, CBS Corp's (N:CBS) CBS or Fox, owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA). 
The FCC asked if the rule ""remains necessary to promote competition, localism, or viewpoint diversity.""
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission is ""teeing up a number of questions"" and keeping an open mind on whether the rules still make sense.
The FCC noted that a version of the rule barring dual ownership of networks has existed since the 1940s and asks if U.S. antitrust laws or other policies would ""serve as a sufficient backstop to prevent undue consolidation between or among the Big Four networks.""
The FCC also wants comments on a rule that bars one company from owning two TV stations in the same market except under certain circumstances. The FCC asks if those rules continue ""to serve the public interest and remains necessary.""
The FCC will also consider if existing rules that limit the number of local radio stations in a single market should be rescinded.
The FCC noted in a report that broadcast networks face significant competition in content creation and cited the billions of dollars that Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube are spending on original content.
""The golden age of television — or the platinum age of content — is the direct result of choice,"" FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, said. ""The gatekeepers of the past are no longer gatekeepers. Americans, using a broadband connection, can access any content, from any device, anywhere.""
Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel raised concerns that ""too much consolidation can reduce the number of voices, jobs, and the newsgathering that results.""

In November 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional local TV stations in the same market.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Poor company disclosure could hamper U.N. sustainability goals: PIMCO,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A United Nations plan to boost global development is at risk of failing to reach its goals because of poor data and target-setting by companies, the world's biggest bond investor said.
The plan, known as the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aims to cut poverty, inequality and environmental degradation globally by 2030. 
But PIMCO said an analysis of disclosures from 240 firms which account for its biggest holdings of corporate debt showed that just 12 percent had quantitative targets based on the U.N. goals and only 6 percent reported on progress toward reaching them. 
""While momentum is building among corporate issuers to contribute to the SDGs, we believe overall private sector progress is insufficient to achieve the 2030 Agenda,"" PIMCO said in a statement. ""Many investors would like to allocate more capital to companies best aligned with the SDGs, but existing levels of disclosure make this difficult to do.""
The fund said improved data was critical to its ability to invest successfully with reference to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, an area of growth for the global fund industry that has spawned numerous new products.
PIMCO isn't at this stage looking to sell out of companies that provide insufficient data, but wants to encourage the process so it can get the information it needs to invest with ESG principles in mind. 
An investor network set up by the U.N., the Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI), has attracted support from more than 1,800 investors representing over $68 trillion in assets under management.
Signatories commit to six principles, the first of which is the incorporation of ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making.
""The greater depth of understanding we have of issuer behavior, the better investment decisions we make,"" said Mike Amey, a portfolio manager and head of ESG strategies for PIMCO.
""What we're trying to do is incorporate these factors in our assessment of quality and value. If we get additional information, that will be part of the decision for ESG portfolios and any portfolio."" 
PIMCO said 63 percent of those companies assessed had no firm targets despite mentioning their support for the U.N. goals in their annual results.

The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, agreed and adopted by all 193 member states in 2015, sets 17 goals including improving health and education, reducing inequality, and spurring economic growth while tackling climate change and preserving oceans and forests.

The department cited the company for 11 ""apparent"" instances of moving oilfield-related items such as spare parts, coiled tubing strings and pump sets, and called it ""an egregious case"" since the Jereh Group did not voluntarily disclose the violations. 
Representatives for the company could not be immediately reached for comment. 
""The apparent violations involved the exportation or re-exportation, and attempted exportation or re-exportation of U.S.-origin goods ultimately intended for end-users in Iran by way of China,"" it said in a notice on its website.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",KKR sees India benefiting from U.S-China trade war,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India can benefit from the trade tensions between the United States and China, Henry Kravis, co-chief of KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said on Wednesday, but he also said the country needed to cut back on red tape to attract more investment.
U.S. President Donald Trump started a trade war with China earlier this year as his administration imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and various Chinese products. Beijing retaliated with import taxes of its own on products such as American-made cars.
""This (the trade war) is very positive for South East Asia and is very positive, in my view, for India,"" Henry R. Kravis, co-CEO of KKR told journalists at a media roundtable on Wednesday.
""As you (India) get better infrastructure, get rid of some of this red tape bureaucracy ... this country will benefit big time.""
India rose 23 places to 77th in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index for 2019, up from 100th in 2018, thanks to improving metrics in areas including access to credit and construction permits.
Kravis also said India's large youth population was a big positive and that the country needed major investment in several sectors such as education, finance, healthcare and environment.
""That's an opportunity for people like us,"" he said.
Kravis also highlighted the need for a healthy local bond market in India.
""If you don't have a long-term bond market you limit the growth because you're putting all the onus back on to the banks to basically be the provider of capital,"" Kravis. ""That's the reason that we set up our two NBFCs (non banking financial companies) here - one in real estate credit and one is in corporate credit.""
KKR, founded in 1976, currently manages assets roughly worth $195 billion. The company opened an office in India in 2009 and currently has about 43 staff. It has invested more than $7 billion in its credit business in the country and will invest more in the business going forward, he said.
KKR has also changed its focus to acquiring control positions or significant minority with near-control rights in companies instead of taking minority positions that did not give the company influence, Kravis said.

KKR's investments in India include hospital management firm Radiant Life Care and Max Financial Services (NS:MAXI), the holding company of private insurance firm Max Life Insurance.

Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, said that discussions included German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing.
Spokesmen for the two banks declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Germany's finance ministry said there was nothing she could say about the report.
The discussions include possible ways to change laws to make a merger cheaper, Bloomberg reported. Talks are in an exploratory phase, the report said.
Shares of Deutsche Bank spiked 6.5 percent, while Commerzbank jumped 7.1 percent.
Speculation about a possible tie-up between the two banks has been rife this year. Last week Focus magazine reported that the German government was ready to orchestrate a merger between them.
Senior officials at both lenders have played down chances of a merger over the next 12 to 18 months as they restructure their companies to make them profitable.

A proposal by the supervisory board to appoint Merz as chairwoman could be included in the invitation to the company's Feb. 1 annual general meeting (AGM), which will be sent out next week, the people said.
If appointed, she would be the first woman to take the post.
Outgoing  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) finance chief Bodo Uebber, who had been a candidate to be Thyssenkrupp's next chairman, failed to win the backing of labour representatives to join the board last month.
No final decision has been made on Merz's possible appointment and there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached, the people said.
Merz was appointed as a supervisory board member last month. She would first need to be confirmed as an ordinary board member by shareholders at the AGM, before she could be put forward as chairwoman.
She would become chairwoman at a pivotal time for the German industrial conglomerate, which in September announced a move to split in two following years of shareholder pressure that led to the resignation of both its CEO and chairman.
If she gets the job, Merz would replace Bernhard Pellens, who took over as chairman at the end of September but can only stay on until 2020 under German corporate governance rules.
A Thyssenkrupp spokesman declined to comment, only referring to the pending invitation to Thyssenkrupp's AGM.
German markets newsletter Platow Brief first reported that Merz was being discussed as a potential chairwoman.
A former chief executive of Dutch firm Chassis Brakes International, Merz is currently chairwoman of automotive supplier SAF Holland (DE:SFQN) and sits on the supervisory board of Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).

She is also a member of the board of directors of truck maker Volvo (ST:VOLVb), Belgium's NV  Bekaert  SA (BR:BEKB) and French roofing business  Imerys  SA (PA:IMTP).

419,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Italy Markets Rally as Government Said to Revise Deficit Lower,"(Bloomberg) -- Italian assets surged after the government was said to propose a revised deficit target in line with demands by the European Union.
The yield on 10-year bonds dropped below 3 percent for the first time since September and stocks climbed after a Treasury official said that the deficit would be revised down to 2 percent from the 2.4 percent initially mooted by the coalition government. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini dismissed reports his party would seek another election in the new year, setting the tone for markets earlier in the day.
Italian bonds have enjoyed a period of relative stability in recent weeks amid signs of cooling tensions with the EU over plans to increase the budget deficit to fund tax cuts, pension reform rollbacks and a basic income for the poorest. Some more leniency from the bloc may be needed after reports that France too would be in breach of fiscal rules in the wake of the yellow-jacket protests.
“This is very good for BTPs,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S, who said 10-year yields could drop toward 2.75 percent. “The 2 percent deficit level is more positive news, but let’s see if they are ready to walk the walk now that they have done the talk.”
Ten-year yields fell 13 basis points to 2.99 percent as of 1:00 p.m. in London. That took the spread over their German peers down 16 basis points to 271 basis points, the lowest since Oct. 1. Two-year yields, seen as a barometer for Italian default risk, slid 19 basis points to 0.47 percent, a six-month low. The FTSE MIB Index rose 1.8 percent, led by banks."

Iran needs to upgrade its ageing passenger fleet and is seeking to avert U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
The U.S. Treasury has revoked licences for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell passenger jets to Iran after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement in May and reimposed sanctions.
Most modern commercial planes have more than 10 percent in U.S. parts, the threshold for needing U.S. Treasury approval.
But Russian officials have been reported as saying Sukhoi is working on reducing the number of U.S. parts in the hopes of winning an Iranian order for up to 100 aircraft.
""If the Iranian airlines want to use this aircraft (Superjet 100 ) and the seller is willing to sell it to Iran, the Civil Aviation Organization is ready to issue its final comment on this aircraft,"" the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Ali Abedzadeh, head of the Civil Aviation Organization, as saying.
""But this aircraft has adhered to world standards and is flying currently, therefore there is no reason for us to reject it,"" Abedzadeh told Fars.
Flag-carrier IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft - 100 from Airbus, 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR (MI:LDOF) before U.S. licences were revoked.

""The airlines have proposals for plane purchases and we are trying to devise regulations that will ease their aircraft imports. Considering Iran's very large market, we need 500 planes now,"" Abedzadeh was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",Physician assistant faces U.S. trial over Insys opioid kickbacks,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A former physician assistant is set to face trial in New Hampshire on Wednesday over charges he accepted kickbacks from Insys Therapeutics Inc to prescribe a highly addictive fentanyl spray the drugmaker produced.
A federal jury in Concord, New Hampshire, will hear opening statements in the trial of Christopher Clough, whose case could provide a glimpse into some of the evidence prosecutors plan to use in the upcoming trial of six former Insys executives and managers.
Both cases stem from what prosecutors say was a wide-ranging scheme overseen by Insys executives including John Kapoor, a onetime billionaire who was its founder and chairman, to pay medical practitioners kickbacks to prescribe its powerful opioid, Subsys.
Prosecutors contend Clough accepted nearly $50,000 in fees from Insys from 2013 to 2014 to act as a speaker at events ostensibly meant to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys but which were actually shams.
Clough, 45, has pleaded not guilty to receiving kickbacks.
A years-long investigation led to the indictment of Kapoor and former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who will both face trial in Boston federal court in January on charges they conspired to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys.
Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce evidence about Clough at that trial. Kapoor, Babich and their four co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy.
Insys in August said it had agreed to pay at least $150 million to resolve a related U.S. Justice Department probe. In 2017, Insys paid $3.4 million to resolve a probe by New Hampshire's attorney general centered on its payments to Clough. 
The cases, brought amid a U.S.-wide epidemic of opioid addiction, center on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Subsys in 2012 for treating sudden increases in pain in cancer patients.
Prosecutors said Insys sought to encourage medical professionals to prescribe Subsys to patients who did not have cancer by paying them speaker fees as a reward for writing prescriptions for the drug.
Prosecutors said that before Clough was stripped of his medical license, he was the biggest prescriber of Subsys in New Hampshire and wrote more than 700 prescriptions for the spray.

Potential trial witnesses include Natalie Babich, a former Insys sales representative who is married to Michael Babich and who pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring to pay kickbacks to, among others, Clough.

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Apple Is Considering Moving iPhone Output If Tariffs Hit 25%,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s suppliers will consider shifting iPhone production away from China should tariffs on U.S. imports skyrocket, but the U.S. company plans to sit tight for now, people familiar with the company’s thinking said.
The tech giant’s suppliers intend to stick with the existing model even if the U.S. levies a 10 percent import tariff on smartphones, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a private matter. But it will have to reassess the situation should U.S. President Donald Trump decide on a more punitive 25 percent, the people said.
iPhones -- the majority of which are made by assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. in China and shipped around the world -- have so far been spared in a tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But Trump told the Wall Street Journal last month that tariffs could be slapped on smartphones and laptops made in China, the world’s largest manufacturer of electronics.
Apple has long used the world’s No. 2 economy as its production base for everything from its signature device to iPads and Macs. The company’s supply chain now spans hundreds of companies, culminating in assemblers such as Hon Hai and Pegatron Corp. Apple wasn’t available for comment outside of U.S. business hours. Hon Hai and Pegatron declined to comment.
Apple’s manufacturing partners are largely beholden to the U.S. company’s wishes. Migrating parts of the sprawling network they underpin will be difficult and the U.S. company seems to be in wait-and-see mode for now, one of the people said. An Apple partner has already suggested alternative locations for non-iPhone production, but the U.S. company has indicated there’s little need to make such a move for now, another person said.
That may change if tariffs escalate, an outcome now in the balance as Washington and Beijing begin thorny negotiations on a trade deal that could scale back a series of tariffs implemented this year. Apple, already grappling with mounting evidence that its latest iPhone line-up has failed to excite consumers, can ill-afford a sharp hike in import taxes.
A 10-percent tariff could result in an earnings-per-share decline of just $1 for Apple, should all its hardware sold in the U.S. be subject to the levy and the company absorbs the cost, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a Nov. 28 research note. That compares with the average 2019 Apple-EPS estimate of $13.32, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
However, a more severe scenario of a 25 percent tariff -- absorbed by Apple -- could result in an EPS decline of about $2.50, he added.
In his early years running Apple, Tim Cook would respond to questions about increasing manufacturing in the U.S. by saying the skill sets in China are more conducive to producing the company’s products. However, in recent months, he has modified that view, saying in an interview this year that “it’s not true that the iPhone is not made in the United States.” Some components, like the smartphone’s glass cover, are manufactured in the U.S. and shipped for assembly in China."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has made a splash this year in Washington, D.C. opening branches for the first time in the nation's capital. 
Smaller branches, ATM kiosks and mobile phone apps are allowing the bank to go into markets more quickly and for less money now than five years ago, JPMorgan executives said.
Banks can venture out now because they have cleaned up regulatory problems since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. President Donald Trump's tax cut left them with cash to invest.
Washington is a prime battle ground, and JPMorgan considers the region the third biggest in the country by population and gross domestic product. 
No bank dominates. The top three hold between 14 percent and 17 percent of deposits in the region, compared with Chase’s 32 percent share in the New York City area. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SCaVzC)
""If you want to be the premier American bank you want to be in all of the key cities,"" said Ken Thomas, a branch location consultant.
Washington offers banks the chance to build brands and make life-long national customers from people passing through as students or employees of changing governments
""You have a microcosm of America here in D.C.,"" said Thasunda Duckett, the CEO of Chase Consumer Banking. ""It is booming and it is a place we have always wanted to be."" 
JPMorgan executives plan to build 70 Chase branches in Washington and Baltimore. Five years ago they probably would have set out to match the 150 Washington branches of Bank of America one-for-one.
Instead, they expect to make up the difference with 150 ATM locations and their mobile phone app and website.
Competitors include  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), which is No. 3 in Washington by deposits. Wells Fargo has been moving some branches from prime corner locations to smaller store fronts a few doors away. 
Bank of America, to protect its No. 1 position, has been remodeling offices with new ATMs and rooms for video conferencing with loan specialists.
 Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), which is No. 2, is taking a different tack. The bank, which acquired one-time market leader Chevy Chase Bank and its 217 branches during the financial crisis, is closing branches and was down to 126 in June.
It is opening up hybrid ""cafés."" They are legally not branches and subject to approval by regulators. But they have ATMs, Wi-Fi connections to the Capital One app, and bank employees for customers to ask about problems and opening accounts online. Capital One is putting a café at a prime corner JPMorgan wanted in the well-to-do Georgetown area. Capital One reportedly paid $50 million to buy the entire building. JPMorgan opted for a small store-front a few doors away where it can have a prominent sign, space for bankers and the latest ATMs.
""We feel really great about this location,"" said Duckett. 
The success or failure of the strategies could separate profit winners from laggards. Physical locations, including staff, real-estate, and handling checks and cash, are a big expense. (http://reut.rs/2a7GEEH) Plus, new regulations make branch deposits more valuable for the biggest banks. 
A sense of urgency has come as rising interest rates make customer service matter to keeping people from taking their deposits elsewhere.
The battle between banks is not limited to Washington.
JPMorgan has also moved into Boston and Philadelphia – glaring East Coast gaps in the branch network of the New York City-based bank. 
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has moved into Pittsburgh, Denver and Minneapolis. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) is moving into Dallas and Kansas City with incentives for online accounts backed by a few small branches.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:52AM ET</span>",Canada frees CFO of China's Huawei on bail; Trump might intervene,"By Julie Gordon and Anna Mehler Paperny
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A top executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd was granted bail by a Canadian court on Tuesday, 10 days after her arrest in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities sparked a diplomatic dispute.
Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, faces U.S. claims that she misled multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
In a court hearing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Justice William Ehrcke granted C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail to Meng, who has been jailed since her arrest on Dec. 1. The courtroom erupted in applause when the decision was announced. Meng cried and hugged her lawyers.
Among conditions of her bail, the 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Five friends pledged equity in their homes and other money as a guarantee she will not flee. 
If a Canadian judge rules the case against Meng is strong enough, Canada's justice minister must next decide whether to extradite her to the United States. If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge.
The arrest of Meng has put a further dampener on Chinese relations with the United States and Canada at a time when tensions were already high over a trade war and U.S. accusations of Chinese spying. 
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Tuesday he would intervene in the U.S. Justice Department's case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Meng's arrest ""was a mistake from the start"". 
""We have already made clear our position to the United States and Canada, who should immediately correct their mistake and release Meng Wanzhou,"" he told a daily news briefing.
""Any person, especially if it is a leader of the United States, or a high-level figure, who is willing to make positive efforts to push this situation toward the correct direction, then that, of course, deserves to be well received.""
China had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released Meng immediately, and analysts have said retaliation from Beijing over the arrest was likely.
The U.S. State Department is considering issuing a travel warning for its citizens, two sources said on Tuesday.
The Canadian government was considering issuing a similar warning, Canada's CTV network reported. Reuters was not able to confirm the report.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Canadian government said that one of its citizens in China had been detained.
The International Crisis Group think-tank said on Wednesday it had received no information from Chinese officials about the detention of its employee, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, and that it was seeking consular access to him.
The Chinese ministry spokesman, Lu, said he had nothing he could say on the details of the case, but said the ICG was not registered in China as a non-governmental organization and Kovrig could have broken Chinese law.
The Canadian government said it saw no explicit link to the Huawei case.
However, Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China, asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp whether the Kovrig detention was a coincidence, said: ""In China there are no coincidences ... If they want to send you a message they will send you a message."" 
ELECTRONIC MONITORING
Meng, who was arrested as she was changing planes in Vancouver, has said she is innocent and will contest the allegations in the United States if she is extradited.
Tuesday was the third day of bail hearings. Meng's defense had argued that she was not a flight risk, citing her longstanding ties to Canada, properties she owns in Vancouver and fears for her health while incarcerated.
Her family assured the court she would remain in Vancouver at one of her family houses in an affluent neighborhood. Her husband said he plans to bring the couple's daughter to Vancouver to attend school, and Meng had said she would be grateful for the chance to read a novel after years of working hard.
""I am satisfied that on the particular facts of this case ... the risk of her non-attendance in court can be reduced to an acceptable level by imposing bail conditions,"" said the judge, adding that he was also persuaded by the fact that Meng was a well-educated businesswoman with no criminal record. 
She must remain in Canada and be accompanied by security guards when she leaves her residence. Meng will pay a cash deposit of C$7 million, with five guarantors liable for a remaining C$3 million if she absconds.
Meng was ordered to reappear in court on Feb. 6 to make plans for further appearances.
Huawei, which makes smartphones and network equipment, said in a statement it looked forward to a ""timely resolution"" of the case.
""We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach a just conclusion,"" it said, adding that it complied with all laws and regulations where it operates.
The case against Meng stems from a 2013 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE90U0CC20130131 about Huawei's close ties to Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran despite U.S. and European Union bans.
Huawei is the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92 billion last year. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Don't contact our board members, Renault tells Nissan - sources","By Ritsuko Ando and Laurence Frost
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) told alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) to stop contacting the French company's directors ahead of a Thursday board meeting as the Japanese automaker tried to share evidence of wrongdoing by its ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, two sources said.
Ever since Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan, Renault and the French government, the automaker's biggest shareholder, have demanded to see the findings of a Nissan internal investigation that include allegations of financial misconduct by the 64-year-old executive.
Ghosn was charged on Monday in Japan for failing to declare deferred income he had agreed to receive for the five years ending March 2015. While Nissan fired him as chairman days after his arrest, he remains chairman and CEO of its French partner.
Renault's board meets on Dec. 13, and the findings of Nissan's investigation will be shared at the meeting where Ghosn's future could be also debated, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The French firm told Nissan not to contact its directors ahead of the meeting, because such contact was outside the agreed channels for communication of the sensitive findings, the source said.
Nissan offered last week to brief Renault's board about findings on what it considers proof of wrongdoing by Ghosn, said a second source who has knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as it was confidential.
But Renault advised Nissan to brief its lawyers instead, which led to a meeting between the Japanese firm's officials and Renault's legal teams early this week in Paris, the person said.
The Japanese automaker later invited Thierry Bollore, who was named Renault's deputy CEO with the same powers as Ghosn a day after his arrest, as well as board members, to examine the contents of the findings, said the source. 
Bollore, though, told Nissan on Tuesday to ""refrain from contacting the board"", the source said.
The exchange between Renault and Nissan is another example of the testy relationship between the two automakers, despite assurances by executives on both sides to preserve the alliance. The alliance, of which Ghosn has been the driving force, is widely seen as vital for the members' long-term survival.
Board members invited to see the evidence included Martin Vial, who heads the French state shareholdings agency, interim Chairman Philippe Lagayette and independent director Patrick Thomas, the second source said.
A Renault spokesperson declined to comment. 
STRONG RESERVATIONS
The French government said on Tuesday it remained unaware of detailed allegations against Ghosn.
Under French government pressure, Ghosn had been exploring a deeper tie-up or even a full merger between Renault and Nissan, despite strong reservations at the Japanese car maker.
Nissan is 43.4 percent owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm. Renault’s biggest shareholder is the French state with 15 percent.
Ghosn was indicted on Monday along with Nissan and alleged co-conspirator Greg Kelly for failing to declare $43 million in deferred income he had agreed to receive, in addition to the $44 million he was paid for the five years ending in March 2015.

French daily Les Echos first reported that Nissan communicated a 400-page dossier on Ghosn's alleged misconduct to Renault via lawyers. The French finance ministry declined to comment.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:48AM ET</span>","Hyundai Motor unveils sweeping executive reshuffle, shares surge","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean conglomerate Hyundai Motor Group shook up its executive ranks on Tuesday and appointed its first foreign head of research and development, raising expectations of a smooth transition of power at the family-run business empire. 
The reshuffle, first reported by Reuters on Tuesday and confirmed by Hyundai on Wednesday, is part of preparations for generational change in the executive ranks at South Korea's second-largest family-owned business empire.
Group President Albert Biermann, a German former BMW executive, was named head of research and development, replacing longtime executives Yang Woong-chul and Kwon Moon-sik. The move was seen as a significant step to bring in fresh ideas at the Korean-dominated group.
In all, 17 top executives were reassigned across the group including at Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp - which together form the fifth-biggest automaker in the world.
The move follows the promotion of Euisun Chung in September to Hyundai Motor's executive vice chairman, moving him closer to succeeding his 80-year-old father, Mong-Koo Chung, as group chairman. 
It comes as Hyundai Motor Co battles to reverse falling profits as a result of U.S. recall costs and weak sales in the U.S. and Chinese markets. 
Hyundai Motor Co shares jumped as much as 9 percent to their highest level since Oct. 10, while shares in affiliates like Hyundai Mobis, Hyundai Wia and Hyundai Glovis also rallied.
While the announcement by Hyundai on Tuesday of a major investment in fuel cell production also lifted sentiment, analysts said most of the share price rise could be attributed to the leadership changes.
In particular, it signaled that the junior Chung was making progress with his plans to restructure the sprawling group after a previous plan was scrapped due to opposition from U.S. hedge fund Elliott.
""The reshuffle signals that the junior Chung is tightening his grip on the conglomerate, a move which raises investors' hopes for change,"" said Kim Joon-sung, an analyst at Meritz Securities. 
GIVING WAY
In a sign that Chairman Chung's grip may be weakening, one of his closest lieutenants, Hyundai Motor Co Vice Chairman Kim Yong-hwan, was reassigned away from the core automaker and named vice chairman of steelmaking affiliate Hyundai Steel. 
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that the reshuffle was ""part of a generational change (the junior) Chung is pushing for."" 
Hyundai Motor Co chief innovation officer Youngcho Chi was promoted to president, as the automaker tries to catch up with its rivals in future technologies such as car-sharing.
Biermann, a former BMW performance vehicle development official, is one of several foreign executives that heir apparent Chung, 48, has brought into the traditionally Korean-dominated group.
In October, Thomas Schemera, also a former BMW executive, was appointed to lead product planning for autonomous cars, connected and electrified vehicles, while Luc Donckerwolke, a former Bentley design chief, was appointed to oversee design at Hyundai and Kia.

The group has previously appointed new senior executives at its overseas operations, including China and the United States.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The fatal crash of a German armed forces helicopter in Mali last year was caused by the failure of mechanics from manufacturer Airbus to correctly set the aircraft's rotor controls after repairs, a defense official told Reuters on Wednesday.
An armed forces investigation of the crash, which killed both pilots aboard the helicopter, found that neither a technical defect nor material fatigue were to blame, according to the official who has seen the report.
Airbus said in a statement that a German military investigation had identified an improper setting of controls as ""one of the factors in the chain of events"" that led to the crash, and precautionary measures had been implemented to prevent any reoccurrence of the issue.
It said the investigation had ruled out any design issue with the Tiger helicopter. The company said it would refrain from further statements due to pending proceedings on the case.
The Tiger helicopter had been deployed to support a peacekeeping mission in Mali's desert when it lurched into a steep, uncontrolled forward dive so severe that the rotors fell to pieces during its rapid descent.
The report found that Airbus mechanics had incorrectly calibrated the Tiger helicopter's rotor controls after repairs carried out at its home base of Fritzlar in central Germany.

The two highly experienced pilots, subjected to enormous G-forces during the plunge, had no chance of correcting the stall, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Elliott Management has taken a stake in  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) worth more than 930 million euros ($1.05 billion) and will work with the family-backed French drinks company to try to improve its performance, the activist hedge fund said on Wednesday.
Shares in the maker of Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal Scotch rose 3.8 percent by 0935 GMT after Elliott said it had a stake of just over 2.5 percent and that it had met Pernod CEO Alexandre Ricard to discuss the way ahead.
New York-based Elliott, which has $35 billion under management and a track record of pushing hard for change in companies, said Pernod possesses an ""outstanding"" portfolio of brands and offers ""one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the industry"". 
However, it said Pernod has lost market share across key segments and has underperformed its peers with respect to operating margins and total shareholder return. 
It also said Pernod's M&A track record was disappointing, particularly its 2008 purchase of Absolut vodka. 
""An environment of inadequate corporate governance and a lack of outside perspectives have contributed to this underperformance,"" Elliott said, suggesting that ""operational and governance improvements would allow Pernod to unlock much of the value that the company is capable of delivering"".
Pernod Ricard was born from the 1975 merger of two French anise-based spirits makers - Pernod, founded in 1805 and Ricard, founded in 1932. 
The Ricard family remains the company's largest shareholder, with a 15.19 percent stake, according to Refinitiv data. 
SHARING ITS VIEWS
The investor said it had written to the company’s board ""to share its analysis and views on value creation"".
Neither Pernod nor Elliott were available for immediate comment on Wednesday morning. 
In October, Pernod reported a jump in first-quarter sales, but also warned that this level of sales growth would moderate as the financial year progressed.
Pernod shares have risen by roughly 7 percent so far in 2018, beating a 5 percent drop in the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Food & Beverages Index (SX3P) and a 4 percent rise in the shares of  Diageo  (L:DGE).
""Given strong recent share price performance and family involvement, we do not expect this to result in a significant change of strategy for the company,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. ""However, it could lead to greater emphasis on margin acceleration, in particular from full year 20 onwards.""
Jefferies calculates that Pernod had total shareholder return of 105 percent over the last 10 years, whereas Diageo returned 145 percent,  Campari  (MI:CPRI) 181 percent and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) 220 percent.

ATP and two other Danish pension funds earlier this year partnered with Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), the world's largest infrastructure asset manager, to buy Danish cable and telecoms operator TDC in a $6.6 billion deal.
Macquarie said in September its incoming and outgoing chief executives were expected to be named as suspects by German prosecutors after its bank lent money to investment funds that engaged in dividend stripping.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares traded higher on Wednesday morning and were set for a second day of gains as sentiment toward the Sino-US trade dispute lifted after U.S. President Donald Trump sounded upbeat about a deal in a Reuters interview.
The Euro zone STOXXE (STOXXE) index was up 1 percent at 0920 GMT with most bourses across the continent in the black. 
In Britain, the pound rose 0.5 percent and the FTSE (FTSE) gained 0.7 percent as expectations grew that Prime Minister Theresa May would survive a leadership challenge - a result that would reassert her authority and potentially diminish the chance of a chaotic Brexit.
Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said he expected a May victory that would probably benefit sterling. 
Amid the general upbeat mood, trading updates from retailers weighed on the overall sector which was the only one trading in negative territory, down 0.2 percent. 
""It looks like another shocker of a day for UK retail as  Inditex , Superdry and Dixons Carphone shares have slumped sharply in opening trade"", wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
Shares of Zara owner Inditex (MC:ITX) fell 4.5 percent as sales and profit growth came below market expectations. 
A profit warning for British fashion retailer Superdry (L:SDRY) saw its shares lose close to 30 percent of their market value. 
Also in Britain, Dixons Carphone (L:DC), the electricals and mobile phone retailer, lost close to 10 percent after reporting a statutory first-half pretax loss of 440 million pounds after booking 490 million pounds of exceptional charges, mainly related to goodwill.

Confirmation of the vote lifted 5-year UK Credit Default Swaps, which traders use as a hedge against uncertainty, to 40 basis points and up from around 31 basis points at the start of December, data from Markit showed.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Wednesday opened a compact version of its cashier-less Amazon Go food stores, broadening its footprint in the bricks-and-mortar world in a move to add shops in places such as office lobbies and hospitals.
Located in one of the company's Seattle offices, the eighth Amazon Go store is near the original and a quarter the size, at a mere 450 square feet. That is about the size of a New York City studio apartment. The new store is aimed at selling salads and snacks to office workers.
Like Amazon Go stores operating in Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle, the new store has no checkout lanes. Customers scan their smartphones to enter, cameras monitor what they take from the shelves, and Amazon bills their credit card on file after they leave.
Selling food in physical stores is a key strategy by the world's top online retailer to win more business from shoppers. Gianna Puerini, vice president of Amazon Go, said the tiny format could serve office lobbies, communal floors inside tall buildings and perhaps a hospital.
""We wanted something from a design perspective that would fit nicely into open spaces,"" Puerini said in an interview. ""You can bring it in pieces and assemble it on site.""
She provided no details on when or where Amazon would add other small stores. The new Seattle location, on the 6th floor of the city's historic Macy's building, is only open to Amazon employees and their guests.

Puerini declined to comment on a Reuters report from last week that Amazon was looking to add cashier-less stores at airports. However, she said, ""Airports have a lot of hungry people in a rush, so you never know.""

443,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>","Germany's Corestate, Medici to invest $1.14 billion in shared living","BERLIN (Reuters) - German property firms Corestate Capital Holding (DE:CCAG) and Medici Living plan to invest 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) in developing tiny apartments with communal facilities in the next three to five years, the two firms said on Wednesday. 
Young professionals priced out of housing markets in major cities are driving demand in the so-called co-living sector where ""microflats"" are grouped around shared facilities such as dining areas, lounges, work spaces, laundry rooms and gyms.
The two German companies, which would invest the funds in the form of equity and debt, said they would focus on European cities with more than 500,000 residents and would develop existing properties and newly constructed blocks.
Each investment would be in the range of 20 million to 60 million euros.
Corestate, a real estate investment manager, and Medici Living, a Berlin-based provider of co-living services, aim to build a portfolio of around 35 assets and add 6,000 rooms to Medici Living's current portfolio of 1,800 rooms.
""Urbanisation, young people's desire for community, as well as the opportunity to live and work in different cities, are boosting demand for communal residential space,"" said Corestate Chief Executive Michael Buetter.
Medici Living founder and Chief Executive Gunther Schmidt said he believed co-living had greater potential than the booming co-working sector.
""This investment is the breakthrough for co-living in Europe,"" he said. ""We want to become the WeWork of co-living,"" he said, referring to the U.S. shared office space provider which has secured investment from Japan's Softbank (T:9984).
Microflats typically range from 200 square feet (about 20 square meters) to 350 square feet for a studio apartment and are being built across the world, from Hong Kong to New York as young people flock to cities.
Corestate and Medici Living said they would focus investment on Austria, Switzerland, Spain and Poland, in addition to Medici Living's current European target markets of Germany, Britain and the Netherlands.
As part of the collaboration, Corestate will be responsible for investment, project development, financing, and asset and fund management. Medici Living will design and operate the properties.

Rolls, whose main business makes engines for large airliners, had forecast group operating profit of 400 million pounds ($509 million), give or take 100 million pounds, and free cash flow of 450 million, give or take 100 million pounds. 
It said it now expects its results to hit the upper half of those ranges after airlines flew their planes for more hours, helping Rolls earn more from maintenance and related activities.
The positive guidance comes despite problems with its Trent 1000 engine which has meant airlines have had to ground some of their Boeing (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner planes, and after slightly lower-than-expected deliveries of some other engines. 
Rolls said that it was readying itself for Britain's exit from the European Union by building up inventory amongst other contingency plans. 
""We will continue to implement our contingency plans until we are certain that a deal and transition period has been agreed,"" Rolls said in a statement. 
The company also said its restructuring plan which will see it shed 4,600 jobs over two years was on track.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stock markets rallied on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald trump sounded upbeat about a trade deal with China, while sterling struggled with the risk of an imminent party coup against British Prime Minister Theresa May.
In an interview with Reuters, Trump said talks were taking place with Beijing by phone and he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he was sure about a deal.
Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department's case against a top executive at China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal.
A Canadian court on Tuesday granted bail to the executive in a move that could help placate Chinese officials angered by her arrest.
The news was enough to prompt a bounce after days of losses, and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 1.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei led the way with a jump of 2 percent, while Shanghai blue chips trailed with just 0.2 percent.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.5 percent and spreadbetters pointed to gains for European bourses.
Having been repeatedly disappointed before, analysts were careful to not get too optimistic about prospects of a trade agreement. 
""From the Huawei case, it is increasingly obvious that the China-US trade war is about the exchange of technology, and the development of advanced technologies by Chinese companies,"" said analysts at ING in a note.
""The truce will not address these issues. And therefore tension between China and U.S. will continue.""
Sentiment had got a lift on Tuesday from reports China was considering cutting import tariffs on American-made cars to 15 percent from the current 40 percent.
Yet there were also reports the U.S. would release evidence this week detailing Chinese hacking and economic espionage.
""Even if this (auto) step is taken it just removes what was a retaliatory measure to begin with,"" noted ANZ economist David Plank. ""Whatever the case, market price action is somewhat of a chop-fest, right now, as it swings around on each new headline.""
Markets had also been jolted when Trump threatened to shut down the government over funding for a wall he has promised to build on the southern border with Mexico. 
A VERY BRITISH COUP
In currency markets, sterling was pinned near 20-month lows amid reports Conservative lawmakers could vote on a no confidence motion in May's leadership as soon as Wednesday night.
The political ructions come a day after her decision to delay a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal for fear of a loss angered many in her party.
The risk kept the pound at $1.2505, having shed 1.9 percent in the previous two sessions to a trough of $1.2483.
The euro held firm at 90.56 pence, but was flat on the dollar at $1.1324. The dollar was still being viewed as the best of a bad bunch and stayed at 97.411 on a basket of currencies.
""The market is concerned that May could be replaced by a Brexit-supporter, increasing the chance of a no-deal scenario,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB.
""Bottom line: there is great uncertainty about whether Theresa May can survive as PM and what the prospects are for a general election, new referendum or a hard Brexit.""
Investors were also looking ahead to the U.S consumer price report later on Wednesday where an expected slowdown in headline inflation would only reinforce speculation of fewer rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
While market still expect the Fed will tighten at its policy meeting next week, Trump said the central bank would be ""foolish"" to do so.
Wagers on a more restrained Fed helped gold stay near a five-month peak around $1,244.17 an ounce.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",U.S. weighs China travel warning over Huawei case: sources,"By Arshad Mohammed and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering issuing a new warning to U.S. citizens, including business executives, traveling to China after Canada arrested a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] executive at Washington's request, two sources said on Tuesday.
Such an advisory from the State Department would warn U.S. nationals of the risk that China could retaliate against them for the detention of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.
Meng, 46, arrested on Dec. 1 in Vancouver, returned to a Canadian court on Tuesday for a bail hearing and is fighting a U.S. extradition request. China has protested her arrest to U.S. and Canadian officials.
Meng faces U.S. accusations that she misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran. This put the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring penalties, court documents said.
Canada confirmed on Tuesday that one of its citizens was detained in China but said it saw no explicit connection to Huawei case.
In its most recent advisory for China issued on Jan. 22, the State Department urged Americans to ""exercise increased caution"" in the country because of ""the arbitrary enforcement of local laws and special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals.""
That advisory said Chinese authorities have the ability to bar foreigners from leaving China, issuing so-called ""exit bans"" to compel them to resolve business disputes, to force settlement of court orders or facilitate government investigations.
Asked whether the United States was warning business people about travel to China due to the Huawei case, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino appeared to reiterate the latest advisory, citing ""the potential for American citizens visiting and residing in China to be arbitrarily interrogated and detained.""
The State Department would have the option of issuing new travel guidelines for China or updating existing ones.
Palladino also told a State Department briefing that the United States was concerned about reports that the Canadian citizen was being held in China and urged Beijing to ""end all forms of arbitrary detention.""

Meng's arrest has roiled markets over fears it would exacerbate U.S.-China tensions as the countries seek to negotiate their way out of a bitter trade dispute.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has ""no plans"" to relaunch a search engine in China though it is continuing to study the idea, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told a U.S. congressional panel on Tuesday amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms. 
Lawmakers and Google employees have raised concerns the company would comply with China's internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation's search engine market.
Google's main search platform has been blocked in China since 2010, but the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit has been attempting to make new inroads into the country, which has the world's largest number of smartphone users.
""Right now, there are no plans to launch search in China,"" Pichai told the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
But he added that internally Google has ""developed and looked at what search could look like. We’ve had the project underway for a while. At one point, we’ve had over 100 people working on it is my understanding.""
Pichai said there are no current discussions with the Chinese government. He vowed that he would be ""fully transparent"" with policymakers if the company brings search products to China.
In a letter in August to U.S. lawmakers, Pichai said providing such a search engine would give ""broad benefits"" to China but that it was unclear whether Google could launch the service there.
A Chinese government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters last month that it was unlikely Google would get clearance to launch a search service in 2019.
Pichai did not say what steps Google would take to comply with Chinese laws if it re-entered the market.
Under questioning from Democratic Representative David Cicilline, Pichai said he would ""happy to engage"" to discuss legislation that would empower the Federal Trade Commission to address discriminatory conduct online.
Cicilline told Pichai it was ""hard for me to imagine that you could operate in the Chinese market under the current government framework and maintain a commitment to universal values, such as freedom of expression and personal privacy.""
The company's rivals in shopping and travel searches have long complained about being demoted in Google search results.
Much of the House hearing focused on Republican concerns that Google's search results are biased against conservatives and that the company had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
Democrats rejected that claim as ""fantasy,"" and at least one said the search results highlighted more conservative voices.
Pichai said the search engine attempts to help people register to vote or find a polling place, but rejected assertions the company paid for Latino voters' transportation to polls in some states. 

""We don't engage in partisan activities,"" Pichai told the panel.

The company, controlled by business magnate Luis Carlos Sarmiento, did not give specifics in its statement about what U.S. authorities are looking into.
However, it did say the inquiry regards a 2010 partnership between its subsidiary Corficolombiana, Odebrecht and Cass Constructores to build the 528 kilometer (328 mile) Ruta del Sol 2 highway to Colombia's Caribbean coast, a contract worth some $1.5 billion.
""Grupo Aval has informed the DOJ, through its lawyers in the United States, that it will cooperate with the investigation of the DOJ, as it has been doing with other government entities,"" the company said.
The company takes the investigation seriously and will relay any developments in its quarterly results filings, the statement added.
Odebrecht has been at the center of a massive Latin America graft scandal. The company acknowledged in a 2016 leniency deal that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries.

In the latest twist in Colombia, a key witness who audited the highway project died of a heart attack on Nov. 9 and his son died of cyanide poisoning two days later.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators from Ohio on Tuesday asked General Motors (N:GM) chief executive Mary Barra to commit to building all future electric vehicles for U.S. buyers at home and to provide more details of plans to cut back on car production in North America.
The letter from Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown demanding answers to questions by Dec. 21 is the latest effort by Congress and the White House to press GM into reversing its decision to halt production at four U.S. plants and cut thousands of jobs.
The senators also asked if GM will produce additional electric cars or shift to building EV SUVs and crossovers.
The letter asks GM to disclose how many people at its suppliers in Ohio will lose their jobs if GM closes its Lordstown Assembly plant as well as how much it will cost to close the plant. GM plans to discontinue U.S. production of the Chevrolet Cruze, which is made in Lordstown.
GM is unlikely to build a new vehicle at Lordstown once it halts Cruze production in March, company officials say, and GM executives have told Congress it would take two years or longer to develop and prepare the plant to assemble a new vehicle.
Barra said last week she would keep an ""open mind"" about the plant's future. The final decision will be made during contract talks in 2019 with the United Auto Workers union, she added.
On Friday, four members of the U.S. House wrote President Donald Trump inviting him to join them in visits to the closing plants and urging him to intervene ""in every manner possible to seek both short and long term remedies for these workers."" 
GM, which is holding a two-day board meeting this week, did not immediately comment on the letter. The company cut hundreds of contract product development jobs in Michigan last week as part of its plan to cut around 8,000 salaried positions in North America by early 2019.
GM said in October 2017 it would launch at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, but has not said where they will be produced. GM builds the EV Chevrolet Bolt at a plant in Michigan, but plans to end production next year of its plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt in Detroit. 
GM builds the Buick Envision in China and exports it to the United States. The company asked the Trump administration in July to exempt the vehicle from a new 25 percent U.S. tariff.

The White House favors ending the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. GM and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) have been lobbying Congress to extend the credit to cover additional vehicles.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - German engineering firm  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) plans to dismiss about 200 workers at a gas turbines parts and components service center in Houston, Texas, next year due to weaker global demand, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. 
The Texas operation will close between late 2019 and 2020, according to the spokesman, who called the decision ""difficult."" 
In a letter to the Texas Workforce Commission, Siemens also pointed to overcapacity within its network.

Along with turbine competitors  General Electric  (N:GE) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (BO:MITU), Siemens has faced oversupply and declining sales as demand for gas turbines has plunged.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Venezuela is facing the possible unraveling of a pair of billion-dollar settlements aimed at protecting the cash-strapped country's U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp from seizure by creditors.
A lawyer for Canadian mining company Crystallex International Corp said on Tuesday Venezuela had breached the $1.4 billion November agreement that resolved a long-running fight over an expropriated gold mine.
Separately, Venezuela's $1.3 billion settlement in October with Rusoro Mining of Vancouver, also over expropriated mining assets, has been upended by U.S. sanctions on Caracas, a source told Reuters.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Both companies had their sights on getting a U.S. court order to auction the parent company of Citgo, which is indirectly owned by Venezuela through its state oil company, PDVSA.
While Venezuela has been crippled by an economic crisis and has defaulted on tens of billions of dollars of debt, it has struck deals to protect Citgo's refineries, a key destination for Venezuela's crude.
Crystallex attorney Robert Weigel said in a statement that Venezuela breached its agreement because PDVSA continued to try to overturn a court order that allowed Crystallex to seize the stock in Citgo's parent company. 
A lawyer for PDVSA disputed that a Monday filing with a federal appeals court amounted to a breach.
""As far as I'm aware, PDVSA is not a party to a settlement with Crystallex,"" said Joseph Pizzurro, the Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle.
Crystallex plans to restart efforts to auction Citgo, according to Weigel, of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
Crystallex also hired the Moelis & Company investment bank to advise it on a possible sale of Citgo, although that process has been stayed during the appeal by Venezuela and PDVSA.
Rusoro's deal in October required Venezuela to pay $100 million by the end of November. Caracas transferred some of that payment to a Canadian bank which returned the funds to Venezuela due to concerns about violating U.S. sanctions, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.
An attorney for Rusoro did not respond to a request for comment.
Sanctions have become a headline concern since Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities. 

Meng, the 46-year-old daughter of Huawei's founder, was accused of misleading multinational banks about Huawei's business in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran, court documents said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government said on Tuesday it remained unaware of detailed allegations against  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) boss Carlos Ghosn sent to the carmaker a day earlier by Japanese alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201).
Ever since Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan, the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, has been demanding to see the findings of a Nissan internal investigation that include allegations of financial misconduct by its chairman.
Ghosn was indicted on Monday along with Nissan and alleged co-conspirator Greg Kelly for failing to declare $43 million in deferred income he had agreed to receive, in addition to the $44 million he was paid for the five years ending in March 2015. 
Renault's board meets on Thursday Dec. 13 amid mounting pressure to dismiss Ghosn as chairman and chief executive. Ghosn's declared salaries at Renault and Nissan have been politically sensitive in France, where President Emmanuel Macron is now battling street protests that have shaken his government.
Macron and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had issued calls for Nissan to share findings from its months-long investigation.
""We're not going to propose that Mr. Ghosn step down for the simple reason that we don't have any evidence,"" Le Maire said on Nov. 21, two days after the car executive's surprise arrest.
Nissan, which ousted Ghosn the same week, finally communicated its 400-page dossier on Ghosn's alleged misconduct to its 43.4 percent-owner Renault via lawyers on Monday, French daily Les Echos and other media reported. A Renault spokesman would not confirm reception of the Nissan findings.
LEGAL CHANNELS
French officials acknowledged that the dossier had been received by Renault, however - while maintaining that the government remained unaware of its content.
Renault had requested that the findings be shared under a strict legal procedure that ""required the agreement of the Japanese prosecutor"", a government source said.
""For the moment we don't have the detailed contents of these documents so we can't take a position.""
The French finance ministry declined to comment.
France holds a 15 percent stake in Renault and two board seats. While Nissan also owns 15 percent of its French parent, the holding commands no voting rights.
Martin Vial, who heads the French state shareholdings agency, has been in daily contact with fellow Renault board members including interim Chairman Philippe Lagayette since Ghosn's arrest, sources close to the situation say.
The boardroom crisis has shaken the foundations of the Renault-Nissan alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken the French parent's control.
Under French government pressure, Ghosn had been exploring a deeper tie-up or even a full merger between Renault and Nissan, despite strong reservations at the Japanese carmaker.
DEFENSE ARGUMENTS
Whether or not they broke the law, Ghosn's undisclosed compensation plans - effectively doubling his total Nissan package - could be politically explosive in France, especially if the government failed to act upon their discovery.
Defense arguments advanced by Ghosn's lawyers and supporters have not contested the plans' existence. His Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru said in a media statement that the compensation agreements had not been properly ratified.
Ghosn's defense partly rests on the contention that his deferred compensation arrangements were vetted internally and by outside consultants, people familiar with the matter said.
Pressure for his formal dismissal from Renault appeared to be growing in the wake of the Japanese indictments.
Officials from two centrist Renault unions, the CFDT and CFE-CGC, are privately urging management to replace Ghosn permanently, sources said - joining the leftist CGT, which was quick to call for leadership change after his arrest.
""Whether or not he's found guilty, his image among staff is so tarnished that I can't imagine him returning to his post,"" said an official with one of the moderate labor groupings.
""It's not easy to oust him without appearing to prejudge the case - but that's really a communication problem now.""

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow closed marginally lower after volatile trading on Tuesday as investors swiveled their focus between China-U.S. trade talks, President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the U.S. government and political uncertainty in Britain.
Wall Street's three major indexes oscillated between positive and negative territory during the day before falling sharply in the last half hour of trading. 
Late in the session, the BBC reported that enough letters were submitted by Conservative lawmakers to trigger a vote of no confidence in the leadership of British Prime Minister Theresa May, who has struggled to reach a deal on the country's European Union exit.
Wall Street saw strong gains early in the day on news U.S. and Chinese officials had discussed a road map for trade talks, which Trump called ""very productive."" But late in the afternoon two U.S. lawmakers proposed a bill to ban the sale of U.S. products to Chinese companies that violate U.S. export or sanctions laws. 
And later in the morning the mood soured as Trump publicly sparred with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi over funding for a wall on the Mexican border during which the president threatened a government shutdown.
""It's so headline driven right now and the market can't wait for the next one,"" Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, said of news on trade and domestic politics. ""Traders don't know what to do. You're coming into the end of December that's typically strong."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.02 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,370.24, the S&P 500 lost 0.94 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,636.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,031.83.
Three of the S&P's 11 major sectors ended in the red. Most of the rest were clinging to tiny gains, while the defensive consumer staples sector closed up 0.9 percent, making it the strongest gainer of the day. 
The financial index was the weakest with a 1 percent drop on the day. 
Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer for Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, said investors could take advantage of the volatility to pick up bargains. 
""We can't control the headlines but the thing we can lean on is that the underlying fundamentals remain solid,"" she said. 
On Monday, the S&P had bounced off an eight-month low to end higher and strategists said trading algorithms kicked in to buy at the day's lows.
Technical trading appeared to fuel Tuesday's moves as well, according to Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
""We had cross currents with the various policy releases and no reason to have strong buying come in a the end,"" he said.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 264 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.01 billion shares, matching the average for the last 20 days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.16%.
“If we don’t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it’s through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,” Trump said Tuesday in meeting with Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi where the media was present.
That wiped out Tuesday's early gains, which had followed improved sentiment on trade amid reports China had agreed to cut its U.S. auto import tariff rate to 15% from 40%, but it remains unknown when the change would go into effect.
Still, auto stocks rose on the report as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) rose about 1%, while Ford (NYSE:F) closed up 0.2%.
Wall Street started the session on the front foot amid reports high-ranking U.S. and Chinese officials held a call to advance trade talks, raising hopes the two nations would be able to find a solution to their differences on trade during the 90-day ceasefire.
Tech also helped the broader market, led by chip stocks as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) continued to shine in the wake of its upbeat earnings release last week.
But Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) kept a lid on gains in semis on a Bloomberg report that Softbank was planning to offload its stake in the chipmaker. No final decision has been made and Softbank may opt to keep its stake or sell only part of it, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, struggled for gains, even as oil prices pared losses from a day earlier, underpinned by an production outage in Libya.
In a sign of skittish sentiment, traders took shelter in defensive corners of the market like consumer staples, which rose 1%.
Financials were abandoned for the second straight day, falling more than 1% on the back of ongoing weakness in bank stocks amid concerns over slowing economic growth and expectations for a slowdown in Fed rate hikes.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell 1.5%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fell 1%.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",U.S. derivatives regulator launches consultation on ether,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator on Tuesday said it was launching a formal consultation on the uses of ether as it aims to more closely scrutinize the virtual currency markets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is one of several regulators, along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Treasury, that is grappling with how best to oversee virtual currencies, which fall into a regulatory gray area.
Ether, powered by a blockchain technology called Ethereum, is among the top three largest cryptocurrencies by market cap alongside bitcoin and ripple.
Since early this year, officials at the CFTC and SEC have been discussing whether the cryptocurrency falls into traditional asset types, such as securities or commodities, and should therefore be subject to the relevant regulations.
The SEC has ruled that bitcoin is not a security but the CFTC says it is a commodity. Neither regulator has taken a position on ripple.
In May, CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz called for federal regulators to clarify the legal status of ether as market participants rushed to list derivatives tied to the digital currency.
Weeks later the SEC announced that ether did not meet the criteria for a security, thus exempting certain transactions in the token from federal securities laws. But the CFTC has not yet taken an official position.
Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform and ether is the token that computer programmers or ""miners"" receive as compensation for developing specialized programs that help verify transactions on the blockchain.
In its consultation, the CFTC suggests that ether could also be regarded as a commodity, a ""fuel"" powering Ethereum, and seeks feedback on how ether and the Ethereum network are used.
It also asks how the function, technology and governance of the digital currency differ from that of bitcoin, what cyber security issues the CFTC should consider and what risk management challenges could result from trading ether as a derivative.

Market participants have 60 days to respond.

483,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Retail Inflation Data Released
Core producer price inflation came in hotter than expected today and tomorrow will bring the retail numbers. Investors will be keeping a keen eye on them ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision, which isn’t a foregone conclusion.
The Labor Department will issue the November consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Currently, economists are predicting that the CPI stayed flat last month. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices and is watched more closely by the Fed, is expected to have risen by 0.2%.
Both measures are forecast to be up 2.2% for the 12 months through November.
2. Tencent Music’s $1 Billion IPO on Tap
China and the U.S. will be in headlines for trade tomorrow, of course, but also for the IPO market.
Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China’s largest music-streaming service, is expected to go public in a deal worth more than $1 billion on the Nasdaq.
The company plans to price 82 million shares between $13 and $15 per share tonight.
At the midpoint of $14, Tencent would raise $1.148 billion.
The IPO was set to happen in October but was delayed because of the market selloff.
The company was anxious to debut on Wall Street this year in case trade tensions between the U.S. and China worsened, Reuters reported, citing a source.
The group will trade under the symbol TME.
3. Another Drop Expected in U.S. Oil Inventories
Crude oil inventory numbers will be the highlight of energy trading tomorrow.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release the latest weekly numbers at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
Traders are currently expecting a drawdown of around 3 million barrels, narrower than the big draw of more than 7 million barrels the week before.
U.S. crude output has become a main driver of oil prices, with speculation that increased supply from the States will overwhelm any production cuts from OPEC and Russia.
The EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook put U.S. output for next year at a record high 12.1 million bpd on the average, versus the average of 10.9 million expected this year. The net increase of 1.2 million bpd would essentially account for all the supply OPEC and its allies planned to cut next year to shore prices up.
""If true, there goes your bullish story for oil from these cuts,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital."

On track for their worst year since 2015, developing markets are getting a tailwind from the U.S.-China trade truce, a weakening dollar and a more cautious tone from the Federal Reserve.

But not all are forecasting a rebound. The Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategist David Woo says he wouldn’t touch emerging markets “with a 10-foot pole” citing concerns about market volatility. And even some clients of Morgan Stanley are less bullish, according to the U.S. bank, citing China as “a significant risk” amid trade negotiations, on top of the growth slowdown there.

488,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO Defense Offers New Guarantors to Win Bail,"(Bloomberg) -- The lawyer for Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou proposed four new guarantors willing to put up millions of dollars to ensure the executive stays in Canada, in an attempt to persuade the judge to release her on bail as she awaits a U.S. extradition request on fraud charges.
Justice William Ehrcke of the British Columbia Supreme Court had previously voiced doubts about Meng’s husband Liu Xiaozong serving as sole guarantor, even backed by C$15 million ($11.2 million) mostly tied to the value of couple’s home equity, since he doesn’t have Canadian residency.
As the hearing entered its third day, Meng’s lawyer, David Martin, presented additional candidates, including a realtor for the couple’s properties in Vancouver, a former Huawei employee, a homemaker whose husband once worked for Huawei and a part-time yoga instructor.
The people are putting up about C$3 million, offering their homes and retirement savings as a guarantee that Meng would remain in Canada while free on bail. If she skipped town, the people would lose their money and properties.
Meng was arrested Dec. 1, at the request of U.S. authorities, as she changed planes in Vancouver on her way to Mexico. The 46-year-old mother of four is accused of conspiring to defraud banks to unwittingly clear transactions linked to Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has 60 days from the arrest date to turn over its full extradition case with supporting evidence.
A ruling is expected later Tuesday afternoon, after the judge said he plans to offer ‘oral reasons’ at 2 p.m. local time.
Meng’s lawyers have argued their client has no criminal record, cited high-profile character witnesses to vouch for her, and say she has substantive ties that ensure she would remain in Vancouver. They’ve also cited health issues,including daily medication, to argue for her release from a Vancouver-area detention center.
Her arrest has sparked protests by the Chinese government, which says Meng committed no crime. She is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, one of the world’s biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment. The case has shaken global financial markets and threatened the fragile trade relationship between the U.S. and China.
The decision is the start of a long legal process in Canada that could end with Meng being sent to the U.S. to stand trial. Even though the North American neighbors have a longstanding treaty governing extradition, it can take months, even years, for a defendant to be handed over, if at all.
At some point, American authorities will have to reveal at least some evidence to justify the request to have Meng turned over and to show why they believe she committed a crime. A potentially thornier issue is whether Meng’s alleged transgressions were illegal in both the U.S. and Canada.
The U.S. has accused Meng of hiding ties between Huawei and a company called Skycom that did business in Iran, violating international sanctions.
Canada has an Iranian-sanctions policy, but it’s less clear if violations are enforced through the country’s criminal code. Sanctions violations aren’t among the extraditable crimes described in the treaty, though there are provisions for fraud by a corporate officer and receiving proceeds from illegal activity.

489,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",FAANG Glory Days May Be Over as Headwinds Persist Into Next Year,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, the so-called FAANG stocks have driven Wall Street higher, fueled by surging revenue, an environment that prized growth over all else, and investor sentiment that viewed the megacap technology and internet companies as ones that could do no wrong.
That narrative showed signs of cracking in 2018. In 2019, it could collapse.
The FAANGs -- an acronym that refers to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- were volatile throughout 2018, with pronounced gains in the first half of the year dramatically reversing in the second half. While Netflix and Amazon remain up about 40 percent on the year, all five have tumbled from record levels, with declines ranging from Alphabet’s 17 percent slump to Netflix’s 37 percent collapse.
Facebook is the group’s worst performer in 2018, having dropped 19 percent year-to-date and by more than a third from its July record. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are off nearly 30 percent from a historic valuation above $1 trillion, a decline that cost its status as the largest stock on the market.
Investors say the downturn probably isn’t over as the companies face their riskiest environment in years with slowing growth, rising macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly with respect to trade policy, and tighter monetary policy.
“The conditions that have allowed these kinds of high-growth stocks to outperform have changed, if not reversed,” said David Lafferty, who helps oversee almost $1 trillion in assets as chief market strategist at Natixis Advisors. “The Fed’s tightening is getting to where it’s starting to hurt. GDP should decelerate in 2019, which will lead to a natural decline in earnings growth. What that means for multiples and investor sentiment is up in the air, but I just don’t see much upside.”
Such macroeconomic issues have added to concerns that the group’s years-long growth story could be coming to an end. Facebook has warned on its growth throughout 2018, and the social-media company, a target of bipartisan criticism, could face increased government regulation on issues surrounding user data, misinformation, and privacy.
Both Amazon and Alphabet’s sales missed analyst estimates in their most recent quarter, triggering the latest FAANG downturn. Since then, there have been multiple signs of weakness surrounding demand for Apple’s newest iPhones, leading to a historic amount of caution from the analysts who cover the stock.
Netflix’s most recent quarter pointed to continuing growth, and it is the only stock of the five where analysts haven’t ratcheted down their targets. But the stock is seen as pricey because of its triple-digit multiple and it has also come under heavy selling pressure as overall sentiment has shifted.
“The positive narrative is now broken. Momentum investors are looking at these stocks in a different way than they used to,” said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer of Adams Funds, in a phone interview. “We can just find better stocks, both in tech and outside of tech, that offer better growth, or better valuations, or fewer risks. The days where the only way you could outperform was to have a taste of the FAANGs are over.”
In another sign of how sentiment has soured, exchange-traded funds that track the technology sector saw massive outflows over the month of November, a period where the group was particularly volatile.
The group’s prospects have broader implications. They are among the largest stocks on the market, giving them an outsized influence on major indexes, and they are often seen as a proxy for overall investor sentiment. Should they continue to struggle in 2019, Wall Street is likely to as well.
“If the FAANGs can resume their leadership role in the market, that would suggest that the economy cycle can perpetuate for longer than people seem to feel right now,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners. “I’m not convinced. Some of these names are crazily priced, and tech regulation is an issue that will get worse before it gets better.”
Mullaney distinguished between the stocks and the longer-term prospects of the companies, saying Amazon, Alphabet, and Netflix would remain dominant players even in the event of a recession. This, he added, suggests that the group would remain widely followed in 2019, even if its performance didn’t match the gains of recent years.
“The FAANG names are reminiscent of cult stocks, and I don’t think the cult effect has been broken,” he said. “I don’t want to say the bubble has burst because I’m sure some people will plow back in looking for growth.”"

491,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",McDonald's to curb antibiotic use in its beef supply,"By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp said on Tuesday it plans to reduce the use of antibiotics in its global beef supply, fueling projections that other restaurants will follow suit.
The move by the world’s biggest fast-food chain addresses concerns that the overuse of antibiotics vital to fighting human infections in farm animals may diminish the drugs' effectiveness in people.
McDonald's becomes the biggest beef buyer to tackle the issue in cattle, potentially creating a new standard for livestock producers and threatening sales by drug companies. 
""McDonald's iconic position and the fact that they're the largest single global purchaser of beef make it hugely important,"" said David Wallinga, a senior health adviser for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council.
McDonald's said it will measure the use of antibiotics in its 10 biggest markets, including the United States, and set targets to curb their use by the end of 2020. The markets cover 85 percent of the company's global beef supply chain.
Medically important antibiotics cannot be used to promote growth in food animals in the supply chain or to routinely prevent disease, according to McDonald's policy.
The company does not expect the policy to raise hamburger prices, although franchisees set their own menu prices, spokeswoman Lauren Altmin said. 
The Animal Health Institute, which represents pharmaceutical companies such as Merck & Co, said it supported ""judicious"" use of antibiotics and that drug makers are developing alternatives.
The Food and Drug Administration last year said sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for food production fell 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, the first decline in year-to-year sales since the agency began collecting the data in 2009. Chicken accounted for 6 percent of the sales, while swine and cattle came in at 37 percent and 43 percent, respectively.
McDonald's has an outsize influence on farm practices due to its size. It previously spurred rivals to eliminate antibiotics from their chicken supplies.
Removing antibiotics from cattle is more difficult, experts said, because the animals live longer than chickens and have more chances to fall ill.
Hamburger chain Wendy’s Co a year ago said it would buy about 15 percent of its beef beginning in 2018 from producers that have pledged to reduce by 20 percent their use of an antibiotic.

""What McDonald's is doing will hopefully start to shift the industry all together from over-using antibiotics,"" said Matt Wellington, antibiotics program director for advocacy group U.S. PIRG.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 03:19PM ET</span>",Defunct startup Sidecar sues Uber: 'hell-bent on stifling competition',"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Defunct startup Sidecar Technologies Inc, which pioneered on-demand ride-hailing, is suing Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], alleging it engaged in predatory pricing and anticompetitive practices that ultimately put Sidecar out of business.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in San Francisco on Tuesday morning, claims ""Uber became hell-bent on stifling competition from competing ride-hailing apps,"" and used subsidies and made fake ride requests to competitors in a bid to dominate the market. Sidecar went out of business in December 2015 and sold its assets to General Motors Co (N:GM) in 2016.
The lawsuit comes after Uber made a confidential filing for an initial public offering last Thursday and is the latest in a long line of legal disputes targeting Uber, which has battled drivers and rival companies.
The complaint was brought by SC Innovations Inc, the successor to Sidecar after it was shuttered. Sunil Paul, the co-founder of Sidecar, said that with Uber, ""it was never a fair fight.""
""That's why Sidecar failed,"" Paul said in a blog post. ""And it's also why both drivers and passengers are left with higher prices and fewer choices today. Now it is clear that Uber's predatory and anticompetitive strategy worked.""
Sidecar alleged in the lawsuit that ""Uber's senior officers and executives directed clandestine campaigns"" to place fraudulent ride requests on the Sidecar app. Drivers were inundated with ride requests sent by Uber that were canceled before they arrived at the pick-up destinations. 
""That triggered a vicious cycle that undermined the ability of Sidecar's app to challenge Uber,"" the lawsuit says.
Sidecar launched a ride-hailing service in 2012, and was the first app to show passengers the price before they booked a ride and to match passengers for car pooling. 
Uber, which was founded in 2009 and had operated a black-car service with professional drivers, launched its lower-cost ride-hailing service in 2013. Ride service Lyft also began in 2012, with all three companies headquartered in San Francisco.
Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival with about 35 percent of the market, last week also filed for an IPO. Most economists consider the ride-hailing industry a duopoly.
""Ridesharing is a highly competitive industry, with many players coming and going over the years, like Sidecar. Not all have survived,"" an Uber spokesman said in a statement. ""New competitors, along with low prices, benefit consumers and reflect the exact type of competition that the antitrust laws are meant to protect."" 
The spokesman said the lawsuit's timing, days after Uber's IPO filing, ""is not a coincidence.""
According to Sidecar's lawsuit, Uber gave bonuses and other subsidies to drivers, reduced passenger fares and lost money on every ride. 
""Uber intentionally sustained near-term losses that were designed to drive Sidecar out of the market while Uber acquired a dominant market position,"" the lawsuit says.
In 2015, Uber passengers were only paying about 40 percent of the cost of rides, using funding to sustain the losses. 
By the end of 2015, Uber had raised $6.9 billion from private market investors, and Lyft had more than $1 billion in funding, according to data firm PitchBook Inc. Sidecar had raised about $43 million, hardly able to compete in a subsidy war.

Since 2016, Uber has repeatedly raised prices for passengers in most markets, increased its commission and cut the amount it pays per mile to drivers, as has Lyft.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - New Jersey Transit's board will decide on Wednesday whether to award the first part of an order for up to 999 cars worth as much as $3.6 billion to Bombardier (TO:BBDb), a copy of the agency's Dec. 12 agenda shows.
The board will vote on the purchase of 113 multilevel passenger vehicles, including passenger amenities and parts, for $669 million.
The deal also includes options for up to 636 vehicles for New Jersey and an additional 250 cars for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) worth a total of $3.6 billion if fully exercised, according to an executive director's report attached to the agenda.
The contract would be one of the largest orders for Bombardier's North American rail business in years, if all options are exercised. 
The agenda confirms a Reuters report in November, which said Bombardier was the preferred bidder for the contract. 
NJT, the largest statewide public transportation system in the United States, with over 900,000 daily riders, has been criticized by commuters and public officials for delays and breakdowns. An audit published in October concluded that its operations were ""inefficient"" and ""unsustainable.""
The Multilevel III Vehicles will feature new customer amenities such as USB ports, an infotainment system, LED lighting, power restroom doors, and a video surveillance system, the agenda report said.
Chinese state rail company CRRC Corp (SS:601766) was also vying for the contract.
NJT had ruled out the competing bid from the Chinese company, although it was not immediately clear why. CRRC, the world's largest train maker, has made inroads in the U.S. market, winning orders in Chicago and Massachusetts, but faces pressure from U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and components.
The New Jersey order would be a boost for Bombardier, which in 2016 launched a turnaround plan for its rail operations in the Americas, following complaints by customers of delivery delays and manufacturing concerns.
Bombardier Transportation, the company's largest unit by revenues, with a $34 billion backlog, aims to lower costs and boost margins by expanding its more lucrative signaling and services business.
Bombardier spokeswoman Maryanne Roberts called the NJT agenda items ""an encouraging development and we look forward to the board's decision tomorrow."" 
A New Jersey transit spokesman referred Reuters to the board agenda.

Bombardier stock was up 5 percent in early afternoon trading.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>","EU opens $22 billion Vodafone, Liberty Global deal inquiry","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vodafone's (L:VOD) purchase of Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) assets in Germany and east Europe may damage competition in Germany and the Czech Republic, EU antitrust regulators said on Tuesday, as they opened a full-scale probe into the $21.8 billion deal.
The deal between the world's second-largest mobile operator and U.S. cable pioneer John Malone's Liberty would enable  Vodafone  to compete more effectively with Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) in the German rival's home market.
It also expands Vodafone's reach in broadband, cable and mobile services elsewhere in Europe as it includes Liberty Global assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.
The European Commission said some rivals might be shut out of the Czech market, where Vodafone offers mainly mobile telephony services and Liberty Global offers fixed services.
In Germany, the deal might reduce competition in the retail fixed telecoms markets and retail TV markets, curb investments in next-generation networks and give the merged firm more power as a TV broadcaster, the EU competition enforcer said. 
It saw no issues in Romania and Hungary and said it will decide whether to clear the deal by May 2. The deadline can be extended if Vodafone offers concessions.
Reuters reported on Nov. 30 that the watchdog was set to launch a full-scale probe into the deal.
Vodafone said it still expected EU approval by mid-2019.
""On balance, we conclude based on the language in the press release that this transaction remains on track for a Phase II approval and closing,"" Bernstein wrote in client note.
The telecoms industry is hoping for a lighter regulatory touch from the Commission after it cleared without conditions Deutsche Telekom's bid to acquire Tele2's (ST:TEL2b) Dutch business despite earlier qualms.

 Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland, which has called for the deal to be blocked, said it expected Vodafone to make every effort to avert the negative effects singled out by the Commission.

The executive told Reuters the United States had not received any formal documentation of China's move. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that China would cut autos tariffs to 15 percent.

China hiked its tariffs on American autos and parts to 40 percent earlier this year after the U.S. raised its tariffs on Chinese vehicles and parts to 27.5 percent.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 12:52PM ET</span>","Verizon takes billions in charges for Oath, voluntary buyouts","By Sheila Dang and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said on Tuesday it will take a $4.6 billion charge related to its Oath media assets - which includes digital media sites Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and AOL - and a severance charge of up to $2.1 billion for voluntary buyouts in the fourth quarter. 
The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers said in a regulatory filing that it saw fewer benefits than it expected from the combination of businesses that make up Oath. Verizon bought Yahoo for $4.48 billion in 2017 and AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015.
In the third quarter, Oath's revenue fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion, putting it far off from its goal of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, which Verizon said it did not expect Oath to achieve. [nL3N1X36DP] 
Oath has struggled to improve its digital advertising business, competing with the likes of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google for ad dollars. Verizon said in September that Tim Armstrong, Oath chief executive and architect of the group, would step down and appointed Guru Gowrappan as his replacement. 
Armstrong's departure came after The Wall Street Journal reported people within Oath felt they did not have enough access to Verizon's wireless subscriber data to improve Oath's advertising. 
Verizon had said that about 10,400 employees will leave the company by the middle of next year as part of its voluntary separation program. The employees will get a salary of up to 60 weeks, bonus and benefits, depending on their length of service. 
The New York based-company said the severance charge was mainly due to the buyouts announced on Monday as well as other headcount reductions.
Verizon, which had 152,300 employees as of the quarter ended Sept. 30, has been looking to cut costs as it ramps up investment in its next-generation 5G network, which is expected to fuel its future growth. 
It said severance charges in the fourth quarter would come to $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion after tax, with the Oath charge amounting to $4.5 billion after tax. 
Analysts on average expect Verizon to post a profit of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company is set to post its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29.

Shares of Verizon were up 1 percent to $58.89 in afternoon trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese stocks look a better bet than the United Kingdom next year, as Britain struggles with its painful divorce from the European Union, a senior executive at BlackRock, the world's top asset manager, said on Tuesday.
""China is slightly more invest-able than the UK right now,"" said Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday.
The comment illustrates the depth of concern about the uncertain outcome of Brexit, with the FTSE 100 (FTSE) and midcap index (FTMC) on track for their worst year since 2008 and sterling languishing at 20-month lows. 
It is also significant as Beijing remains locked in a protracted trade row with Washington, which has triggered big sell-offs in China's volatile equity market in recent months amid worries it will hurt the world's second-largest economy.
BlackRock's Bolton said he would wait until there is clarity around that dispute. But he pointed as positives to Beijing's efforts to shore up its economy and expectations the government will take more aggressive action in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown next year. 
""We think the upside is potentially bigger than the downside. We've been edging money back into China,"" he said.
In contrast, he still sees a 30 percent downside risk to domestically focused U.K. equities as Prime Minister Theresa May's deal flounders with less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29. 
The blue-chip FTSE 100, which makes 70 percent of its income outside of the UK, has fallen 11.5 percent so far this year, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is down 15 percent year to date. 
The sterling was near 20-month lows on Tuesday after May on Monday pulled a parliamentary vote because she faced defeat and a day later rushed to Europe to try and renegotiate new terms. 
While BlackRock doesn't expect Britain to go through a hard Brexit, the political uncertainty will cast a cloud over the market for the foreseeable future. 
That may be the case for European equities too, Bolton said.
""In Europe, we're more cautious over the next year or two. The primary reason is politics, with the unknown factors of Brexit, concerns around the French government, a new policymaker in Germany and the open question of Italy,"" he said.
""International investors will remain on the sidelines. I don't see them returning until there is clarity."" 
The asset manager's top pick is U.S. equities based on expected earnings growth of 9 percent - compared with 5-6 percent in Europe - and the pace of share buybacks of some $800 billion, Bolton said.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) delivered 61 of its best-selling 737 single-aisle aircraft in November, up from 50 a year earlier, suggesting that the planemaker may be finally moving past supplier problems that have dented production. 
Total deliveries for the first 11 months of 2018 rose to 704 from 680 in the same period a year earlier. Boeing expects to deliver 810-815 planes in 2018.
The company has been striving to overcome production bottlenecks stemming from delays in the delivery of fuselages and engines from its suppliers.
Investors and analysts closely watch the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms for cues on the company's cash flow and efficiency.
Airbus said last week it had delivered 673 aircraft up to the end of November, leaving 109 aircraft still to be delivered in December to reach a core target of 782 deliveries.
Boeing delivered a total of 79 aircraft in November.
Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said last month that deliveries would rebound in the last two months of the year despite supply delays in engines and other components.
The company's deliveries could take a hit if Indonesia's Lion Air decides to cancel orders for Boeing's 737 MAX jets following a crash that killed 189 people in October.

Lion Air, a privately owned budget airline, has 190 Boeing jets worth $22 billion at list prices waiting to be delivered, on top of 197 already taken, making it one of the U.S. manufacturer's biggest export customers.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 11:16AM ET</span>",BlackRock and peers slash research budgets as new EU rules squeeze brokers,"By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock and other investment houses have slashed their budgets for external research by as much as half after the introduction of new European Union rules, piling pressure on stockbrokers, a senior executive at the world's top asset manager said on Tuesday.
The EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, known as MiFID II, which took effect in January, states investment research must be priced separately from other broker services to ensure transparency and better value for money.
With the rules making clear how much investors are being charged for research, many asset managers are scrutinizing more than ever what they're paying for and using less. 
""It's really clear the amount being paid is 30-50 percent lower and that's staying there,"" Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities at BlackRock, told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday.
""A lot of people are waiting for it to get better, but I don't think it will. Budgets are down and aren't going to come back up.""
The sweeping changes in how asset managers consume research will underscore concerns about pain being felt across European equity research providers almost a year after MiFID II came into force.
Stockbrokers have been the main losers from the new legislation, Bolton said, echoing a sentiment across the financial sector.
""We basically think twice before having a meeting (with a stockbroker), and we share meetings,"" Bolton said.
Verena Ross, executive director of the EU's European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the implementation of MiFID II, said the watchdog was closely monitoring the market's concerns about research.
""The landscape is changing and that has some implications, but at the same time the evidence from the data is not particularly firm yet,"" she told a conference in London.
The watchdog will look, in particular, at whether there is sufficient coverage of small-cap companies, she said.
The cuts are likely to drive consolidation as small- and medium-sized brokerages struggle with the loss of research income and falling commission fees amid growing competition, experts say.
The comments come after reports last month that Australia's Macquarie (AX:MQG) was in talks to buy boutique London-based broker, Liberum, in a bid to strengthen its UK equities business as MiFID II forces it to pay for research.
German private bank Berenberg has laid off staff in its equities business amid pressure from MiFID II, the Financial Times reported last month.

""We haven't seen the mass cull I'd expected. We'll see more mergers (in 2019),"" BlackRock's Bolton told a briefing earlier on Tuesday. He is also co-head of fundamental equities and head of the European equities team at the world's top asset manager.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 11:05AM ET</span>",Brexit Britain's financial sector faces 'slow puncture',"By Huw Jones, Sinead Cruise and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Life in London's financial district will appear little changed when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, defying predictions of an exodus of high-flyers to rival centers like Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin.
But as chaos reigns in Westminster, the mood in the capital's historic ""Square (NYSE:SQ) Mile"" and Canary Wharf's gleaming towers is one of resignation and regret.
Without meaningful access to the EU's single market, the financial services sector is braced for a long goodbye to its status as the world's international trade and banking hub, more than a dozen senior industry players told Reuters.
""It could be a slow puncture,"" said City of London leader Catherine McGuinness, flagging a steady drain of talent and activity from an industry that has wielded little influence in Brexit negotiations even though it generates about 10 percent of Britain's economic output.
""We won't know what we are going to look like for at least 10 years.""
Sources cited years of political strife -- from Scotland's 2014 independence referendum to the bitterly contested Brexit vote and its aftermath -- that have hurt Britain's image as a safe haven for banks, market-makers and investors.
Few are willing to bet that the financial industry, whose 2.3-million-strong workforce stretches across the country, will be bigger or more profitable in a decade's time.
Parliament has yet to settle on whether Brexit will be hard, soft or even happen at all after Prime Minister Theresa May pulled a vote scheduled for Tuesday on her divorce deal with the EU that she acknowledged she would lose.
But the feeling in the City is that much of the damage has already been done and is largely irreversible.
The finance industry is also grappling with a new political reality in which it has no clear allies in government.
Bankers initially expected ministers to champion their cause above other industries. Instead, the finance sector has been sacrificed to protect manufacturing and secure an end to freedom of movement from the EU.
""It feels like we have been thrown under the bus,"" a senior executive at one of Britain's top banks said.
EURO ZONE GRAVITY
Britain and its financial regulators argue that the vast financial services ""ecosystem"" that has evolved in London since the 1980s ""Big Bang"" will help the City maintain its role as 'banker to Europe'.
The French, German and Irish governments are pushing hard to replicate this, however, incentivizing big financial firms to expand in their countries and wooing bankers who fear for their job security in post-Brexit Britain.
Many banks, insurers and asset managers who want to retain access to customers in the EU after March 29 have already redirected hundreds of millions of pounds of investment towards new or expanded hubs in the bloc.
Nearly 40 banks from London have applied to the European Central Bank for licenses. According to Frankfurt Main Finance, which promotes the German financial capital, these are set to transfer 750-800 billion euros in assets early in 2019.
The shift in activities has alarmed UK regulators so much that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has written to banks saying they must be able to justify any shift of non-EU business from London to EU hubs.
The Bank of England's top regulator Sam Woods has said he expects around 4,000, or about 1 percent, of City jobs to have left by Brexit Day, a fraction of the 30,000-232,000 some consultants had initially forecast.
A Reuters survey of 123 firms in September showed as few as 630 UK-based finance jobs had been shifted or created overseas.
But the ECB has told financial firms they must staff their new EU offices with decision-makers, managers, risk-takers and support teams appropriate to the business they operate from them, meaning a slow brain-drain from Britain looks inevitable.
""Once the European regulators have their hooks in you, they can then start to ratchet things up, limiting how much outsourcing to London and elsewhere outside the EU that you can have,"" said David Lawton, a former senior FCA official and now with consultants Alvarez & Marsal. 
Some core services are already moving.
The London Stock Exchange's MTS Cash and CME's BrokerTec platforms will have moved all trading in euro-denominated government bonds and repurchase agreements to the bloc by March, whatever form Brexit takes.
Customers of share-trading platform Aquis will use a new Paris hub from March, with only non-EU stocks left in London.
French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said on Monday that some customers now want to clear their trades in the euro zone instead of London.
""The train has left the station and it ain't turning back. The U.S. and Japanese banks will never put their eggs in one basket again,"" a senior UK banking industry official said.
Other parts of the transaction chain may follow.
That includes clearing of 210 billion euros a day of repo trades, according to Godfried de Vidts, chair of the ICMA European Repo and Collateral Council.
""It will not be possible to do a big bang and move everything from the City to the euro zone in one go because it's far too complex, but it will happen progressively over the next few years,"" de Vidts said.
Insurers like AIG (N:AIG) and RSA (L:RSA) have already obtained court approval to shift chunks of policies with EU customers from London to Luxembourg.
Global banks like JPMorgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC), which made their European homes in London, are scattering staff across EU cities as a ""multipolar"" European financial system slowly emerges.
""The pity here is that we are crumbling and unravelling something so efficient for everyone, that took more than 30 years to build,"" said a senior banking executive who declined to be named.
""Day 1 (after Brexit) may look benign, and Day 2 may look slightly different ... But what is very clear is that there is no single winner, it is a question of who loses most.""
TUG OF RULES
Monday's delayed vote has shortened the odds on a no deal Brexit but Britain may secure a ""standstill"" transition deal, retaining EU rules and full single market access until at least the end of 2020. If so, the extent of damage to the City will become more apparent when transition ends.
""When you consider all that London has survived through, up to this point, it is tough to say that the vast majority of it won't cope just as well the other side of Brexit,"" said Omar Ali, head of financial services at consultancy EY.
""But saying we're not facing imminent disaster is not the same as saying our success is guaranteed in 10 years' time.""
The EU has said Britain's financial market access after transition would be based on its equivalence system, a patchy and politically uneasy gateway that requires home rules of foreign financial firms to be closely aligned with the EU's.
The EU is tightening up equivalence conditions ahead of Brexit.
""There are steps being taken to regulate third-country access in areas where it hasn't been regulated before,"" said Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe.
The EU accounts for 40 billion pounds or a fifth of UK financial sector revenues, with half depending on full ""passporting"" or unfettered access to the single market.
With that in mind, some UK lawmakers and bankers say Britain should focus on fashioning rules and taxes that keep London competitive with global financial centers like New York, Singapore and Shanghai.
""There will be in effect a permanent debate on whether to align or diverge from the EU framework,"" said Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
EU policymakers shrug at Britain's arguments that European companies will pay more for financial services without the cost efficiencies currently offered by London's scale and scope.
Their ultimate aim is a capital markets union (CMU) that will end the EU's reliance on London as a source of funding.
Progress so far is slow as London continues to clear more than 90 percent of euro-denominated derivatives. Efforts to dislodge chunks of that $280-350 billion a day business have largely been resisted so far.
London's global dominance in foreign exchange trading and cross-border lending has also yet to be challenged.
The amount of international lending channelled through UK-based banks grew by about 11 percent in the first six months of 2018, compared to the same period last year. 
The next two largest markets are the United States, where lending declined by 1.68 percent and Japan, which saw a 4.79 percent rise. But there is no room for complacency.
""The long-term requires that the capital market becomes more self-sustaining in Europe,"" said Jonathan Hill, the former EU financial services chief and an architect of the CMU, who is now an advisor to UBS (S:UBSG).
""Whether they can pull it off is a different question. But it won't stop them trying.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) has hired Justin King, the former boss of supermarket chain Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), as a non-executive director, adding another big-name industry veteran to its board.
M&S said on Tuesday that King, one of Britain's best known businessmen, would take up his new role on Jan. 1. Shares in the firm were up 1 percent at 1355 GMT.
After a decade of failed reinventions, the 134-year-old M&S is now targeting sustainable, profitable growth in three to five years by shutting less-successful stores. It warned last month that sales were unlikely to improve any time soon.
King is best known for leading the revival of Sainsbury's as chief executive over ten years. He delivered over 10 billion pounds ($12.7 billion) in incremental sales, a near-tripling in earnings and total shareholder return of 85 percent, before stepping down in 2014.
Prior to that, he was director of food at M&S and before that was part of the leadership team at supermarket group Asda, where he worked with Archie Norman, another turnaround specialist who is now M&S's chairman.
""Justin is recognized as one of the UK's most successful retail leaders,"" said M&S.
King has been vice-chairman of private equity firm Terra Firma since 2015, although it was reported by Sky News earlier this month that he was stepping back from day-to-day management of the buyout group.
When he quit Sainsbury's he said he wanted another big job. That is yet to materialize.
Analysts said that given King's history his appointment will increase the pressure on chief executive Steve Rowe, an M&S lifer, and on new food managing director Stuart Machin.
Analysts speculated that should Norman lose patience with either he would have a ready-made replacement in King, although Britain's corporate governance guidelines advise against moving a non-executive director to an executive role. 
""Having worked there 15 years ago, M&S has a very special place in my affections,"" said King. ""I look forward to joining the board and supporting Steve in the turnaround that he is leading.""

580,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Tesla is crushing the stock market — even as traders are betting big against it,"Even as  Tesla remains the most shorted US-listed stock, it's beating the broader market by a mile.
Tesla has soared 45% since putting in its 2018 closing low of $250.56 in early October. The S&P 500 has fallen 8% over the same time. Shares are now trading near $366, about 6.6% below their all-time high hit in June 2017.
All the while, Tesla remains the most heavily shorted stock in America, measured by short interest in US dollars, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm. Much to the chagrin of CEO Elon Musk, investors have a short position of nearly $10.4 billion, according to the firm's analysis.
Musk  has been infamously vocal about short-sellers targeting his company. ""These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it,""  he tweeted in June of last year. ""What they do should be illegal,"" he said on Twitter in October, four days before the stock hit its 2018 low.
""Overall, Tesla shorts are a very stubborn bunch, even though they are down $6.5 billion in mark-to-market losses since 2016,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics, wrote to Business Insider in an email on Monday.
Trends within Tesla's short-seller landscape have indeed shifted this year.  Two measures of Tesla's short interest were at 2018 lows last week, according to IHS Markit.
The stock's recent surge has not been the result of a short squeeze, Dusaniwsky said. A so-called short squeeze comes about when investors rush to cover bets against a security, adding to upward pressure in the asset.
The dramatic move in a relatively short period of time may have come from two key fundamental drivers.
Tesla came out with  strong quarterly earnings in late October, reporting an unexpected profit in a quarter it called ""truly historic."" The stock  surged on the report.
Then in early November, Tesla said the Australian telecom executive Robyn Denholm, already a director on the board,  would replace Musk as its chair. The move appeared to assuage some investors' anxiety about leadership at the company. Tesla's stock was up nearly 5% since the appointment.
Tesla was up 17% this year.

585,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 09:28AM ET</span>",The 'Trump Trade' has finally evaporated entirely — here's what that means for the market's future,"As President Donald Trump's global trade war ratcheted up several notches in recent months, the market clung stubbornly to one last vestige of a more optimistic time.
We're referring to the so-called Trump Trade, which, since Trump's victory in the November 2016 election, had been a solid representation of the market's policy expectations.
The Trump Trade is shown in the chart below. For the purposes of this discussion, it's being defined as the ratio between more growth-sensitive cyclical stocks (industrials) and their defensive counterparts (utilities).
As you can see, the relative outperformance that existed for more than two years has now vanished.
A quick glance at this chart shows just how effective it was at assessing the Trump Trade. The ratio skyrocketed immediately after Trump's victory as investors speculated that the president would make good on his myriad campaign promises. It spiked again in early 2018, immediately after the enactment of the GOP tax law.
Put simply, this ratio of industrials to utilities was a reliable proxy for the optimism surrounding Trump's various policy initiatives. That is why it's so disconcerting that the massive comparative advantage enjoyed by industrials for so long has been wiped out.
So where do we go from here? If the factors responsible for erasing the Trump Trade persist, its unceremonious end may end up being the least of the market's problems.
The most obvious headwind is a continued escalation of the trade tensions that are already wreaking havoc on markets. Every week brings a fresh new set of issues for Trump's administration and his trade-war opponents in China, and experts across Wall Street are already factoring in the negative impact this could have on both earnings growth and economic expansion.
In addition to this overhang, which is widely expected to hamper stock performance in 2019, investors are also worried about the Federal Reserve. There's a growing wariness that the central bank will commit a policy error when raising interest rates, which would lurch an uncertain equity landscape into even more turmoil.
So while the Fed is widely expected to raise rates another 25 basis points at its December meeting, a recently inverted yield curve suggests that traders are actually positioning somewhat for a rate cut, which would signal fresh recessionary fears. And that's never good news for stocks.
Ultimately, the tenuous situation in stocks is a situation of Trump's making. He's the one who ramped up the trade war, and he's also the one responsible for supplanting a dovish Fed chair.
In the event that the market gets even more tumultuous, he'll have to shoulder a great deal of the blame. After all, he doesn't have the Trump Trade to fall back on anymore."

They rose as much as 2.9 percent in midday trade and were up 1.9 percent by 1334 GMT, outperforming their UK peers. The FTSE 100 (FTSE) was up 1.8 percent.
Chatter about the rumor was mentioned on the Financial Times' Alphaville markets chatroom. 
The chatroom moderator said: ""There's a mad story going round the traps about Amazon going for Morrison ... Looks to me like wild speculation, but stranger things I guess...""
The supermarket chain has struck wholesale supply deals with Amazon and is widely seen as a potential takeover target for the U.S. company as it moves into bricks-and-mortar retailing after its takeover of Whole Foods. 
A spokesman for Morrisons said the company does not comment on speculation about transactions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks jumped on Tuesday as investors clung to hopes of a detente in the China-U.S. trade war and picked through the rubble of conflagrations in other top economies, with heightened uncertainty over Brexit and French protests.
A report China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars drove European stocks to extend gains strongly as auto stocks jumped and the market interpreted this as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. 
The report came after China's Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
S&P 500 and Dow futures were up 0.8 to 1 percent, indicating a strong open on Wall Street. 
Euro zone stocks rose 1.8 percent and Germany's DAX climbed 2 percent while Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.6 percent. Germany's DAX, the most China-sensitive market in Europe, last week entered bear market territory.
MSCI's world equity index gained 0.4 percent - set for its first day of gains after a five-day losing streak. China's blue-chip index had risen 0.5 percent overnight.
Sterling, meanwhile, still floundered near 20-month lows as the market sought clarity on the next steps for Brexit after Britain's prime minister postponed a vote on her deal. 
WHERE NEXT FOR BREXIT?
Sterling hesitantly rose 0.4 percent to $1.2610 as traders sought to price in a range of possibilities after Prime Minister Theresa May's abrupt decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement on Monday, a move that sent the pound spiralling down to $1.2505.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said volatility across UK assets has increased, with option markets pricing a wider range of outcomes including Brexit without a deal, a last-minute agreement or another referendum on EU membership.
""We still think a no deal is a very low probability, but the uncertainty will persist for some time,"" said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK). 
""The events of the last few days show you why there’s caution,"" he added. 
May embarked on the first leg of a trip to meet European leaders on Tuesday, seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal, while at home some lawmakers agitated for a vote of no confidence.
The EU was adamant the withdrawal agreement, including its most contentious element - a ""backstop"" for the Northern Ireland frontier - could not be renegotiated.

Bond markets were focused on France as investors fretted over fiscal spending after the government announced concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often violent protests.
President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners.
This sent French bond yields to their highest level over Germany's in 19 months, with the spread over the safe-haven German Bund hitting 48.5 basis points.
Macron's announcement ""leaves open the question about how the new fiscal measures will be covered financially,"" wrote UniCredit analysts. 
Olivier Dussopt, junior minister for public accounts, said on BFM TV the measures would cost 8-10 billion euros ($9.1-$11.4 billion).

The dollar index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, slipped 0.3 percent to 97.078.
In emerging markets, stocks rose 0.4 percent from one-month lows hit on Monday.
The shock resignation of India's central bank governor hurt India's NSE share index initially, but it closed up 0.6 percent, helped by election results in three states which were not as poor for the ruling party as some had expected.
Oil prices rebounded strongly from earlier losses, having sunk on Monday. 
U.S. crude futures climbed 1.2 percent to $51.61 and Brent futures rose 0.8 percent to $60.47.
Growth worries still stalked markets.
Japan's economy provided the latest negative data point, contracting the most in over four years in the third quarter.
Disappointing economic data has fanned worries about corporate earnings and factory output, with the Sino-U.S. trade battle clouding the outlook for growth.
All sectors in Europe are in the red this year after oil became the last to give up all its 2018 gains, as investors licked their wounds and awaited the end of a bruising year.

China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars to 15 percent from the current 40 percent, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.
The step hasn't been finalized and could still change, according to the report. 
Shares of U.S. automakers including General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) rose about 2 percent in premarket trading on hopes that the move could revitalize sales that took a hit when China ramped up levies on U.S.-made cars.
European auto stocks (SXAP) also rallied 2.8 pct on the news, as several of the carmakers build SUVs in the United States and sell in China. 
BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler AG (DE:BMWG) rose between 2.3 percent and 4 percent.
A proposal to reduce tariffs on cars made in the U.S. to 15 percent has been submitted to China's Cabinet to be reviewed in the coming days, according to the report.
Beijing had raised tariffs on U.S. auto imports to 40 percent in July, forcing many carmakers to hike prices.
The news would also be beneficial for Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) that has been hit hard by increased tariffs on the electric cars it exports to China.
The U.S. firm, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said it will cut prices to make its cars ""more affordable"" and absorb more of the hit from the tariffs. Tesla is also building a local plant in Shanghai to help it avoid steep tariffs.

""China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%,"" Trump had tweeted last week.

8minutenergy will use the more than $200 million in capital to develop projects throughout the United States over the next five years, including in California, Texas and the U.S. Southeast, Buttgenbach said in an interview.
The company has more than 10 gigawatts of projects under development, with 2 GW under contract.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian banks are expected to reach a deal with Islamic tax authorities before the end of the year to resolve a dispute over increased liabilities, banking sources say.
Banks have been at loggerheads with the authorities since at least the start of the year over additional payments of zakat - the name of the tax - for years going back as far as 2002.
Banks have been contesting the extra payments, but a compromise is close, said the sources, with one adding that the tax will be calculated at 10 percent of each bank's profit.
The previous calculation by the General Authority of Zakat and Tax (GAZT) was based on 2.5 percent of a bank's equity, with adjustments.
GAZT did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The increase in payments across the banking sector could be as high as 25 billion riyals ($6.7 billion) if banks are told to pay zakat based on a rate of up to 2.5 percent of their book value, estimated Shabbir Malik, regional financial analyst at investment bank EFG Hermes.
If the formula changes to banks paying zakat based on 10 percent of profit before tax, it could be around 14 billion riyals, he estimated.
The dispute prompted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to intervene earlier this year and direct the government to find a breakthrough.
The sources said bilateral discussions have been continuing between the lenders and GAZT and should be finalised before the end of the year. One of the sources said the deal was likely to be less harmful for banks than some lenders initially feared.
Analysts previously warned if the liabilities were too onerous they might tighten liquidity at the banks, many of which help finance the budget deficit through purchases of local bonds.
They could also curb banks' ability to lend to the private sector, an integral part of Prince Mohammed's reform plan to move the economy away from reliance on oil and create jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Saudis.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hyundai Motor's two R&D vice chairmen offer to resign - sources,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group's two vice chairmen in charge of research and development (R&D) have offered to resign, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
R&D president Albert Biermann is likely to be named the new head of the division, two of them added, declining to be named as they are not authorized to speak to media.
Hyundai is battling a plunge in sales, profits and its share price, and the reshuffle would be the latest since it promoted Euisun Chung in September to executive vice chairman, moving him closer to succeeding his octogenarian father as head of South Korea's second-largest group.
The group has appointed new product strategy, design chiefs and replaced senior executives at its overseas operations, including China and the United States.
The latest shake-up at the group, which includes Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270), could be announced on Wednesday, one of the sources said. 
It is ""part of a generational change Chung is pushing for"", another person said.
A Hyundai Motor spokesman declined to comment.
The group's vice chairmen, Yang Woong-chul and Kwon Moon-sik, both aged 64, told senior officials at its R&D center on Tuesday that they would leave the company, the sources said, declining to say why they had offered to resign. 
Biermann, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) performance vehicle development official, adds to a flurry of foreign executives that Chung, 48, has brought in to the company typically dominated by Koreans.
In October, Thomas Schemera, also a former BMW executive, was appointed to lead product planning for autonomous cars, connected and electrified vehicles, while Luc Donckerwolke, a former Bentley design chief, was appointed to oversee design at Hyundai and Kia.
Hyundai Motor's third-quarter net profit plunged by two-thirds, hit by U.S. recall costs that added to its problems. The automaker was already suffering with weak sales in its key U.S. and Chinese markets.

Hyundai's share price is down more than 10 percent this quarter, despite a recent rebound driven by a share buyback plan announced on Nov. 30.

604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",China Moves on U.S. Car Tariff Cut Trump Tweeted About,"(Bloomberg) -- China is moving toward cutting its trade-war tariffs on imported U.S.-made cars, a step already brandished by President Donald Trump as a concession won during trade talks in Argentina.
A proposal to reduce tariffs on cars made in the U.S. to 15 percent from the current 40 percent has been submitted to China’s Cabinet to be reviewed in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.
The step hasn’t been finalized and could still change. Top Chinese and American trade officials spoke by phone Tuesday morning Beijing time, signaling that dialog between the two nations on trade issues is at least continuing despite a diplomatic row over the arrest of a senior Chinese businesswoman.
The Finance Ministry didn’t immediately respond to faxed request for comment sent outside business hours.
In July, China had boosted the tariff on American-made cars to 40 percent as part of retaliatory measures against the U.S. Following a summit on trade in Buenos Aires earlier this month, Trump jolted global auto stocks with a tweet that China agreed to “reduce and remove” tariffs on imported American-made cars, something China did not confirm at the time.
Trump’s tweet came shortly after he agreed with Xi to a truce in the trade war during a meeting at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina.
The trade war has taken a toll on car companies that manufacture in the U.S., with the makers of Mercedes-Benz and its rival BMW both warning of lower profits this year as tariffs forced them to hike prices in China. Car sales in the world’s second-biggest economy declined for a sixth consecutive month in November, bringing the market closer to its first annual drop in at least two decades. That’s piled pressure on auto companies that have relied on the country for growth amid declining car sales in the U.S.
The tariff reduction benefits Daimler and BMW more than U.S. automakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). or Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. That’s because the German luxury brands dominate the top 10 list of vehicle imports into China.
Longer-term, China has a lot to gain from free trade in autos as Chinese manufacturers such as Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. look to move overseas. The U.S. currently charges a 27.5 percent tax on imported cars from China.
Of China’s $51 billion of vehicle imports in 2017, about $13.5 billion came from North America, including sales of models made there by non-U.S. manufacturers like BMW. China imported 280,208 vehicles, or 10 percent of total imported cars, from the U.S. last year, according to China’s Passenger Car Association.
U.S. exports of cars and light trucks to China were worth $9.5 billion in 2017 and have dropped off significantly since China imposed its retaliatory tariffs over the summer that gave exporters in Europe and Japan a significant advantage.
For Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a tariff cut will provide a boon until the company sets up local production. The Palo Alto, California-based carmaker has been working with Shanghai’s government on establishing a factory to assemble cars in China.
Foreign carmakers have long pleaded for freer access to China’s auto market, while its own manufacturers are trying to expand abroad. In April, China announced a timetable to permit foreign automakers to own more than 50 percent of local carmaking ventures.

Ghosn has been held in a Tokyo jail since he was arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of conspiring to understate his pay by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million) awarded over five years from 2010. He was officially charged on Monday.
He was also re-arrested on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018, with the Tokyo District Court extending his detention until Dec. 20.
Ghosn's lawyers filed an appeal to overturn the detention midday Tuesday, but it was rejected by the court by evening.
From indictment, cases typically take months to go to trial. In the past, suspects who have been indicted have seldom been freed on bail, but in recent years that has become more common, said Masashi Akita, a defense lawyer. 
It is unclear whether Ghosn would be freed on bail as some legal experts have said he may be a flight risk.
Nissan, which fired Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest, has said the misconduct was masterminded by the executive with the help of former Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also indicted on Monday. Kelly will also remain detained until Dec. 20, the district court said.
Ghosn's lawyer in Tokyo, Motonari Otsuru, could not be reached at his office for comment.
But Kelly's lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he was certain that his client's innocence would become clear in court.
""The reason I'm confident is because there was no violation of the financial instruments and exchange law,"" he said.
Ghosn's arrest marks a dramatic fall for a leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.
The executive has been treated like others in detention, held in a small, chilly room, with limited opportunities to shower and shave, a person familiar with the matter has said.

Asked about criticism that Japanese prosecutors often try to force confessions from suspects, deputy prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Shin Kukimoto, has said no such method was being used with Ghosn and Kelly.

""The fact that markets are actually moving forward shows that investors are perhaps scouting around for bargains amid this year’s turmoil rather than sitting on their hands in fear"", commented Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Smaller companies in the UK-focused FTSE 250 (FTMC) were flat. 
Among top performers was British advertising giant WPP (L:WPP), which rose 4.9 percent after announcing plans to spend 300 million pounds and cut 2,500 jobs - part of new boss Mark Read's plans to return the world's biggest advertising group to growth.
Shares in Ashtead (L:AHT) jumped 6.4 percent as the equipment rental firm said it expected full-year results ahead of expectations.
In Germany,  Linde  (DE:LING) rose 2.7 percent after news that shareholders would be offered an extra 1.22 euros to help complete a merger with U.S. rival Praxair (NYSE:PX). 
France's Suez (PA:SEVI) fell 3.2 percent as a source said the board of French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) decided to stick with its 32 percent stake in the utilities group. 

In Italy, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) was the best performer in Milan (FTMIB), up 3.1 percent after announcing it had agreed to sell up to 7.8 billion euros in bad loans along with a stake in its debt recovery business to Credito Fondiario and U.S. fund Elliott.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>",Uber's dominant size may rob smaller Lyft of its IPO oxygen,"By Joshua Franklin and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and smaller rival Lyft are driving side-by-side on the road to a stock market debut, and that may not bode well for Lyft as investors decide where to place their bets in the ride-hailing sector.
Uber and Lyft both submitted confidential IPO filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Thursday, suggesting that their public offerings could take place in close proximity, unless one decides to take a pause.
Some IPO investors interviewed by Reuters said two IPOs in quick succession could force them to choose between Uber and the smaller and less diversified Lyft.
""The advantage of being first to market with your IPO is the ability to control your destiny without being impacted by how the competing IPO is performing in the public market,"" said Jim Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief investment officer of Creative Planning Inc, a wealth and investment manager in Overland Park, Kansas, which manages $35.7 billion and advises clients who already own shares in Lyft and Uber, or are considering buying them. 
The first company to debut will get to define the sector in the eyes of stock market investors. 
Uber will likely draw investor attention to its larger market share and wider business operations, such as freight hauling and food delivery, while Lyft will play up its smaller but highly focused ride-hailing business, said people close to both companies. 
Lyft operates in the United States and Canada and the majority of its business is ride-hailing, although, like Uber, it recently got into bike and scooter renting. It expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $30 billion in an IPO, sources have said.
Uber, on the other hand, operates in more than 70 countries -- although like Lyft it is also still unprofitable. Investment bankers have said it could be worth as much as $120 billion in an IPO, which would be one of the largest on record and would likely sap most of investors' appetite for ride hailing.
""Very large IPOs can be hard to absorb into the market,"" said Kathleen Smith, founding principal at Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. ""It would not be favorable if Lyft and Uber come to market at the same time.""
Sources said there has so far been no change to Lyft's IPO plans in light of news of Uber's following suit. But sources close to Lyft said it lost precious time by not pulling the IPO trigger while Uber faced a number of challenges and scandals last year.
Throughout 2017, Uber was pummeled by a series of controversies, including allegations of sexual harassment, obtaining the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver in India, a massive data breach, and federal investigations into issues including possibly paying bribes to officials and illicit software to evade regulators.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who was named to the top spot in August 2017 after Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned under investor pressure, and his leadership team have attempted to reset the workplace culture and clean up the messes. They clinched settlements with U.S. states over the data breach and with Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) self-driving car unit, Waymo, which had sued Uber for trade-secrets theft.
Spokespeople for Lyft and Uber declined to comment. 
""It would have been a particular advantage for Lyft to have gone earlier when Uber was under a lot of pressure from a PR perspective,"" said Alex Wellins, co-founder of IPO advisory and investor relations firm Blueshirt Group LLC.
FIERCE RIVALS
Lyft did not push for an IPO earlier because it wanted to build up its business, grow revenue and make its stock market flotation more attractive to investors, according to sources familiar with its thinking. 
David Erickson, senior fellow and lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania and former co-head of global equity capital markets at  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), saw advantages to Lyft by waiting. Lyft ""clearly had things in the hopper that makes their story richer,"" he said.
The companies are betting on a similar reception from public market investors that they saw in their private financing rounds, which have been oversubscribed. 
To be sure, Uber and Lyft could decide to space out their IPOs. And if the recent stock market volatility continues, the companies may change their IPO plans altogether.
Uber has a history of maneuvering to one-up Lyft so it could appear to be a step ahead of its business rival. In 2014, as Lyft was preparing to launch its carpooling service, Uber rushed to publicly announce its own carpool, even though it did not have the service ready, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Uber must be thinking it “did all the heavy lifting, took all the risks,” said Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, a Lyft investor. ""They can't let Lyft take the credit and define the expectations of investors.""

The move against Apple and its regional distributor comes just days after the Egyptian Competition Authority accused the Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker of violating local law by preventing its regional distributors from selling to Egyptian distributors -- a move that eliminated what it called “intra-brand competition.”
It said Apple also banned parallel imports of Apple products into the Egyptian market.
The decree published in the Official Gazette threatened legal action against Apple and its agent in the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates-based Arab Business Machine. Calls for comment from ABM were routed through various individuals and voicemail systems before being cut off. A message was left with Apple’s media relations department in London outside business hours.
The competition authority said that while companies had a right to specify sales areas, in Egypt the local market had in effect been isolated from the regional one, sending prices significantly higher than in other Arab nations.
An iPhone Xs Max with 512 gigabytes storage, for example, costs the equivalent of $1,306 in the U.A.E., while the same phone is listed for the equivalent of $1,983 in Egypt through an authorized Apple reseller."

Vivendi, which holds a stake of around 24 percent, has been battling with Elliott over Telecom Italia, where Elliott wrested control over the board from Vivendi in May.
Vivendi said a decision by Telecom Italia this month not to convene a shareholders meeting to choose new auditors went against the principles of proper corporate governance.
""For this reason, Vivendi has decided to write to the board before the end of the week, to urge it to convene a shareholders’ meeting as soon as possible to appoint new financial auditors, revoke five current board members from the Elliott list of 10, particularly those who were involved in these governance issues, and propose five new ones,"" Vivendi said in a statement.

In November, Telecom Italia appointed Luigi Gubitosi as chief executive in a move seen as suggesting a more aggressive shake-up of the company which prompted his predecessor to call for a shareholder vote on the potential change in strategy.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. private investment firm Castlelake LP has struck a deal to buy a portfolio of about 30 narrowbody planes from AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) for a total price of roughly $800 million, people familiar with the transaction said.
The deal underscores the strong appetite of funds to invest in the global aircraft leasing sector, which is benefiting from growing demand on the back of a rise in low-cost carriers and passenger traffic.
For AirAsia, the deal marks another move to monetize its assets as Asia's biggest budget airline seeks to transform itself into an asset-light, digitally focused firm. The carrier is cashing in on a booming leasing sector after ordering hundreds of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) planes at bargain prices in recent years to become one of Airbus' biggest customers.
Castlelake, a global fund focused on alternative investments, has been stepping up its exposure to aviation assets. In June last year, it raised $1 billion from investors including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and pension funds.
""Castlelake is growing at a fast pace and looking to buy aviation assets,"" said one of the people. ""This is one of their biggest deals in Asia with one airline.""
Castlelake clinched the deal from Malaysia's AirAsia after edging out U.S. lessors, funds and leasing units of major Chinese banks in a tightly contested deal, said the people, who did not wish to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the transaction.
Castlelake and AirAsia are expected to close the deal in the next few weeks, the people said.
Castlelake and AirAsia declined comment.
Earlier this year, AirAsia agreed to sell part of its aircraft leasing portfolio in a staggered deal for $1.2 billion to firms managed by BBAM Ltd, one of the world's largest aircraft portfolio managers.
Castlelake is buying older aircraft which are under lease to AirAsia's affiliated airlines, the people said. AirAsia's leasing subsidiary, Asia Aviation Capital, manages AirAsia's planes.
""This is an upcoming sector for asset managers. They see an opportunity to buy older aircraft and sell them once the lease expires,"" said another person familiar with the transaction.
Castlelake was ranked as the 32nd biggest lessor with the value of its total fleet estimated at $2.1 billion in consultancy FlightGlobal's ranking of top global lessors as of September 2018.

Chinese bank-owned leasing units and the likes of U.S. listed AerCap Holdings NV (N:AER) and  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) GE Capital Aviation Services dominate the leasing industry, but the share of asset managers and funds is gradually rising.

Consumer preferences have shifted rapidly to SUVs in recent years, impacting Hyundai with its sedan-heavy line-up. The automaker has since introduced new SUVs, including a redesigned Santa Fe this year, but its U.S. sales still fell 1.6 percent in January-November in a near flat market.
Weak sales in the United States and China has left Hyundai bracing for a fifth consecutive year of annual profit decline.
In South Korea, the Palisade's price starts at 36.22 million won ($32,224.20), slightly higher than the smaller Santa Fe.
""I think it will sell well in Korea because of its price competitiveness, though the model could cannibalize sales of the Santa Fe,"" said auto analyst Sean Kim at Dongbu Securities.
Hyundai has not yet disclosed U.S. pricing for the three-row, eight-seat car, which will compete with the likes of Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Highlander and Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Explorer.
At home, the automaker has embarked on a marketing blitz for the new model, including a full, front page teaser ad in a major newspaper, an endorsement by pop star BTS and featuring the car in television drama Encounter.
The Palisade will replace the larger version of the Santa Fe as Hyundai's biggest SUV. The automaker is looking to end a poor record in the large SUV segment, where it discontinued its Veracruz in 2013 as sales dwindled.

The new model will help Hyundai raise its number of SUV models to six next year, from two last year. Its premium brand Genesis also plans to launch its first SUV next year.

SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Chinese court has ordered a sales ban of some older Apple Inc iPhone models in China for violating two patents of chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, though intellectual property lawyers said enforcement of the ban was likely still a distant threat.
The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple's business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.
Apple said on Monday that all of its phone models remained on sale in mainland China and that it had filed a request for reconsideration with the court, the first step in a long appeal process that could end up at China's Supreme Court.
""It's incredibly unlikely, I'd say almost impossible (that Apple would have to stop sales),"" said a Beijing-based IP lawyer who is not directly connected with the Qualcomm case but has worked with large U.S. tech firms.
""In all likelihood it will drag on for some time. It's worth keeping in mind that this is just one battle in a larger rift"", he said, referring to the legal fight between Qualcomm and Apple that stretches from European courts to South Korea.
Qualcomm said in a statement the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.
Apple said the trio of new models released in September were not part of the case.
""Qualcomm's effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,"" Apple said.
Reuters couldn't immediately reach the court for comment.
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are Apple's third-largest market, accounting for about one-fifth of Apple's $265.6 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year.
Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case in China in late 2017, arguing that Apple infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.
COURT BATTLE OVER DETAILS
In July, the same court banned the import of some microchips by Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) into China, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp (UMC).
In the provincial Chinese court, which is separate from China's specialized intellectual property courts in Beijing, one party can request a ban on an opponent's product without the opponent getting a chance to present a defense.
IP lawyers said that an appeal process could take the case up to the Fujian provincial high court and then go as far as the Supreme Court in Beijing, a process that would likely take many months given the high-profile nature of the case.
To enforce the ban, Qualcomm separately will have to file complaints in what is known as an enforcement tribunal, where Apple will also have a chance to appeal. 
Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels, said the Chinese injunction could put pressure on Apple to reach a global settlement with Qualcomm.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose less than 1 percent to $169.60, recovering from an early drop when it became clear phones were still on sale, and Qualcomm stock rose 2.2 percent to $57.24.
TRADE WAR IMPACT?
The ruling comes as Beijing and Washington are locked in a tense trade dispute. The two sides have agreed to trade negotiations that must be concluded by March 1.
While IP lawyers said the case wasn't directly political, most agreed it could be drawn into broader Sino-U.S. trade tensions, where technology and IP have been a core focus.
The specific iPhone models affected by the preliminary ruling in China are the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.
Erick Robinson, a patent lawyer in Beijing and former Qualcomm lawyer, said that while Chinese courts had become fairer in recent years, nationalism could sometimes be a factor in rulings.
Qualcomm is a key technology vendor to China's rising smart phone brands such as Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, while Apple competes directly against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], China's top homegrown maker of premium-priced smartphones, whose CFO was arrested this month for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions.
""There is probably a political play here. Apple is a direct competitor to the biggest companies in China, whereas Qualcomm is a supplier,"" Robinson said. 

Qualcomm officials said tensions between the two nations had no bearing on the ruling. The company has had its share of troubles in China, from an unfavorable 2014 antitrust ruling to regulatory limbo that doomed its $44 billion bid for Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors.

While news that top Chinese and American trade officials talked over the phone helped the region’s shares almost erase early Tuesday losses, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index soon headed back in the red. S&P 500 Index futures showed a similar trading pattern.
There’s been a deluge of bad news in recent days -- from the unsolved case about the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer to the surprise exit of India’s central-bank governor on Monday evening -- and the optimism seen after the 90-day trade truce between the U.S. and China is far gone. Since Dec. 3, Asian stock markets have already lost more than $1 trillion in market value, with the regional gauge trading at a six-week low.
The big hit on Tuesday came of course from India, after Urjit Patel quit the Reserve Bank of India as a governor amid a rift with the government. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index fell as much as 1.5 percent as the rupee -- already Asia’s worst-performing currency this year -- slumped. Now concerns are growing over the country’s monetary policy, both foreign and domestic, just as political uncertainty grows ahead of a general election next year, adding the potential for more volatility in the equity market. Results from state votes are due Tuesday.
And the bad news doesn’t stop there:
South Korea’s Kospi index traded between gains and losses Tuesday, with Samsung (KS:005930) Biologics Co. heading for a record jump as it avoided a delisting from the stock market. In Southeast Asia, Philippines shares ended a four-day losing streak. Data showed the nation’s trade deficit widened more than estimated.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>","Nissan, Ghosn clash over Rio apartment filled with art, cash: filing","By Marcelo Rochabrun and Ritsuko Ando
SAO PAULO/TOKYO (Reuters) - A Rio de Janeiro apartment containing cash, art works and personal belongings of Carlos Ghosn has become the latest battleground between the indicted former Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) chairman and the automaker.
Ghosn is seeking to retrieve ""personal belongings, documents, cash, objects and art pieces” from the beachfront apartment, which Nissan says it owns. The home could contain evidence of financial misconduct, according to a filing by Nissan in a Brazilian court last week.
The legal dispute has been fierce in recent days, showing that Ghosn and Nissan are not just clashing in Japan, where the scandal first broke and where Ghosn was formally charged on Monday, but around the world.
Ghosn's family obtained a favorable injunction last week that was then swiftly overturned, but Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported the family obtained another favorable court decision on Monday.
A PR representative for Ghosn in Brazil declined to comment. A source at Nissan in Brazil on Monday afternoon said the Ghosn family still does not have access to the apartment.
The previously unreported court papers seen by Reuters show the extent of the legal dispute between Ghosn and Nissan over access to the apartment, one of several around the world he has been able to use. Nissan alleges Ghosn, who had been hailed for bringing the company back from the brink of bankruptcy, underreported his income by tens of millions of dollars and diverted corporate funds for personal use. 
The Rio apartment contains three safes that Nissan has yet to open, according to the filings. The carmaker found them when it did an audit of the apartment following Ghosn's firing, the company said. 
The apartment also has ""designer furniture, artwork and decorative objects,"" it added. 
The Rio apartment was purchased by a Nissan subsidiary in late 2011 following the carmaker's launch of a factory in the nearby city of Resende.
The apartment was bought on expectations that Ghosn's trips to Brazil, where he was born and maintains citizenship, would ""become more constant"" after the factory opened, Nissan said in the filings. 
The apartment is in the Copacabana neighborhood, on a road directly facing Rio's famous beaches. An apartment in the same building was listed online for 12 million reais ($3.07 million). 
Monday's indictment in Japan puts the ball back in the court of Nissan's alliance partner,  Renault  (PA:RENA). The French company, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is preparing for a Dec. 13 board meeting likely to consider Ghosn's future as its chairman and chief executive.
Renault has so far stopped short of dismissing Ghosn while repeatedly demanding access to the findings of the Nissan internal investigation that led to his arrest.
""INCALCULABLE RISK""
Court proceedings in Brazil started on Nov. 29 when a lawyer for Ghosn asked a judge to grant him access to the Rio apartment.
Nissan says allowing him access would ""represent an incalculable risk of destruction of potential evidence of crimes allegedly committed."" So far he has been denied access by Brazil's courts. 
A lawyer for Ghosn, Jose Roberto de Castro Neves, told Reuters he was unaware of the existence of three safes and that it was ""absurd speculation"" that they may contain evidence of wrongdoing. 
""He's a very smart guy,"" de Castro Neves said in a brief phone interview. ""If he had done something wrong, he would never leave it in the apartment.""
Tokyo prosecutors on Monday indicted Ghosn for under-reporting his income and also charged the automaker, making Nissan culpable for the alleged financial misconduct, which has shocked the industry. Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Nov. 19 and is being held in a Tokyo jail.

Ghosn has not made any statement through his lawyers in Japan but has denied the allegations, according to local media.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google on Monday defended the integrity of the company's products a day ahead of a congressional hearing where he is expected to face tough questions from U.S. lawmakers.
The technology company has been under fire on Capitol Hill over issues including why it delayed disclosing vulnerabilities with its Google+ social network, whether it will restart its search engine in China and if it is biased against Republicans.
Three Democratic senators wrote the Federal Trade Commission in October asking the agency to investigate Google+.
In written testimony to the House Judiciary Committee made public on Monday, CEO Sundar Pichai said he led the company ""without political bias.""
""We work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we’ve put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards,"" Pichai's testimony said. ""I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests.""
Pichai agreed in September to testify over Republican concerns that the company is biased against conservatives. Google has repeatedly denied this.
The company faced renewed criticism on Capitol Hill after senior executives skipped a high-profile Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier in September.
Google previously told U.S. lawmakers it was considering ""a variety of options"" to offer additional services in China, but declined to detail plans for addressing Chinese censorship.
The company has been criticized after reports it was considering re-entering China’s search engine market and would comply with its internet censorship and surveillance policies.
Pichai said in his testimony that ""even as we expand into new markets we never forget our American roots."" He added that ""we do work, and we will continue to work, with the government to keep our country safe and secure.""
Pichai may face questions about Google+. On Monday, Google said it would shut down Google+ in April, four months ahead of schedule, after finding a software flaw for the second time this year that allowed partner apps to access its users' private data.

However, Google said in a blog post it found no evidence that any other apps had accessed the data, such as name, email, gender and age, using the latest bug. It affected 52.5 million Google+ accounts, including some business customers, for six days after it was introduced last month, Google said.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian provincial court on Monday weighed whether to grant bail to a top executive of one of the world's biggest telecommunications companies, Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], while she awaits a ruling on extradition to the United States. 
U.S. prosecutors want Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to be extradited to face accusations she misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions which would incur severe penalties, court documents said.
Meng's lawyers told the court high-tech surveillance devices would ensure their client does not flee and proposed a C$15 million ($11.3 million) bail guarantee for her release.
Meng's arrest has roiled markets over fears it would exacerbate tensions between the United States and China, already at a high over tariffs. The two sides have agreed to trade negotiations that must be concluded by March 1. 
Beijing has demanded Meng's immediate release and threatened ""consequences"" for Canada. But both Chinese and U.S. officials appear to be avoiding linking her arrest to the trade dispute.
Meng, the 46-year-old daughter of the founder of Huawei, was arrested on Dec. 1 as she was changing planes in Vancouver. In a sworn affidavit, she said she is innocent and will contest the allegations against her at trial if she is surrendered to the United States.
Meng's lawyers argue that while she awaits the extradition ruling, she should be allowed to live in one of her two multi-million-dollar Vancouver homes and travel through the area as long as she is accompanied at all times by drivers and minders from a security firm. She would also wear a global positioning system (GPS) bracelet at all times, her lawyers said. 
Of the C$15 million guarantee, C$14 million would be in equity and C$1 million in cash, they said. 
At one point the judge asked why Meng had avoided travel to the United States since 2017 if not to avoid arrest. Her lawyer David Martin cited a ""hostile"" climate toward Huawei in the United States.
""I ask the court to ask itself, what motive could she possibly have to flee?"" Martin said, arguing the evidence against her was not overwhelming.
""If she were to flee, or breach order in any way ... it doesn't overstate things to say she would embarrass China itself."" 
Meng appeared confident in court on Monday, smiling and taking her lawyer's arm. She has argued she needs to be released because she has severe hypertension and fears for her health.
Huawei is the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92 billion last year. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas.
U.S. officials allege Huawei was trying to use the banks to move money out of Iran. Companies are barred from using the U.S. financial system to funnel goods and services to sanctioned entities.

Huawei and its lawyers have said the company operates in strict compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions of the United States and other parties.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The S&P 500 is not yet in a bear market, but nearly half of its components are.
Hurt by worries about global growth, the S&P 500 (SPX) on Monday fell as much as 1.89 percent before reversing course and ending the session with a 0.17 percent gain, trimming its loss so far in December to 4.44 percent.
The S&P 500 index has been in a correction since October, defined by many investors as a drop of 10 percent or more from a high. It has not crossed the 20 percent threshold, widely viewed as the definition of a bear market.
However, 237 stocks in the S&P 500 - 47 percent of its components - on Monday were down 20 percent or more from their 52-week highs. Another 128 S&P 500 stocks had fallen 10 percent or more from their 52-week highs, but less than 20 percent.

The index on Monday remained down 10 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL), until recently Wall Street's most valuable company and the largest component of the S&P 500, has declined 27 percent from its record high on Oct. 3, accelerating the index's losses as investors fret over cooling demand for iPhones.
Pessimism has spread beyond the S&P 500 to smaller companies across the U.S. stock market, with hundreds of stocks hitting lows for the year on a daily basis in recent sessions.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico governor signs bill for $2 billion in tax relief,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló signed into law on Monday legislation to provide nearly $2 billion in tax relief over five years amid concerns by the U.S. commonwealth's federally created fiscal oversight board about how the island will fund the tax break. 
Rosselló said the new law will improve the island's investment climate, while providing tax cuts for residents and businesses.
The legislation, which was introduced in April, establishes an earned income tax credit of as much as $2,000 annually per worker and slightly reduces individual and corporate income tax rates, as well as the sales tax on prepared food. It further eliminates a tax on business-to-business transactions for those establishments with annual revenue of less than $200,000, affecting almost three-quarters of island businesses. 
Most of the changes will take effect next year, the governor said.
To fund the tax cuts, the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth is counting on $1.7 billion in additional revenue over the next five years from increased efforts to collect taxes. The $200 million annual cost of the earned income tax credit was previously included in the government's projected expenditures.    
  Puerto Rico has been in federal court since 2017 trying to restructure roughly $120 billion in public debt and unfunded pension liabilities under a form of bankruptcy.
After enacting the law, Rosselló told reporters that the island’s fiscal oversight board has certified that the tax measures are “revenue-neutral.” 
The fiscal board, however, raised flags over one provision in the new law that calls for the legalization of unauthorized video gaming machines. That move would generate some $160 million in additional annual revenue, according to government estimates. 
""The oversight board has repeatedly expressed its concerns that the video lottery provisions included in the legislation are not revenue neutral because the government and legislature have not put forth sufficient evidence that these changes will not cannibalize existing Commonwealth Fiscal Plan revenues,” Natalie Jaresko, the board's executive director, said in a statement.
A statement from Rosselló's office said video lottery revenue will not fund the administration’s tax reform measures, but will be mainly allocated toward police retirement and municipalities’ healthcare costs.
Jaresko said there will be no further comment until Puerto Rico certifies that the tax reform law complies with the island's fiscal plan. That certification is due by Dec. 19.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 05:09PM ET</span>","Automakers, unions say strong currency rules a must in U.S.-Japan trade deal","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit automakers and labor unions on Monday insisted that any U.S. trade deal with Japan contain strong provisions to combat currency manipulation and pry open Japan's largely closed auto market before lowering any U.S. autos tariffs.
At a hearing on U.S. negotiating objectives for trade talks expected to start early next year, the United Auto Workers union called on the Trump administration to demand imposing strict quotas on Japanese vehicles and parts, with any increases based on the growth of U.S. automotive exports to Japan.
Desiree Hoffman, UAW international representative, said that despite zero tariffs on vehicle imports, Japan's auto market is largely closed as a result of other barriers such as Japan-specific regulatory, safety and emissions standards and currency manipulation to push down the value of the yen. 
""These barriers have created an uneven playing field so much so that for every car that the U.S. exported to Japan in 2017, Japan sent 100 back,"" Hoffman said. ""Any loosening of the 2.5 percent automotive or 25 percent light truck tariff would further direct Japan's overcapacity to our shores, exacerbating the problem.""
Currency provisions stronger than those negotiated in the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico free-trade deal are needed in a U.S.-Japan trade agreement, said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).
Given Japan's history of currency market intervention, he said, ""more enforceability"" was needed with clearer penalties for violating currency provisions. He said in the past, AAPC has advocated that trading partners with high current account surpluses and high foreign currency reserve levels be cut off from free-trade agreement benefits if they are found to be intervening in currency markets.
""We recommend the administration avoid making any concessions that would further open the U.S. market to Japanese imports unless and until there is evidence that Japan is truly committed to opening its auto market to U.S. vehicles,"" Blunt said.
AFL-CIO trade policy specialist Celeste Drake said a U.S.-Japan trade deal should have a sunset clause that allows termination if it fails to achieve a 50 percent reduction in the U.S. non-military industrial goods trade deficit with Japan.
The total U.S. goods trade deficit with Japan was about $69 billion in 2017, with autos trade accounting for about 75 percent of the gap. 
U.S. OBJECTIVES
Testimony from the hearing will feed into the U.S. Trade Representative's formulation of negotiating objectives for the trade talks, which U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to launch in late September.
Japan has sought to keep discussions on currency separate from trade agreements. The Bank of Japan has intervened on occasion to maintain currency stability in the face of safe-haven inflows.
A representative of foreign-brand automakers in the United States said currency issues are better dealt with by multilateral groups such as the Group of 20 or Group of 7 major economies.
""We don't want to limit our policy options to promote economic growth here,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers, adding that such provisions could restrict U.S. monetary policy.
Bozzella, whose organization represents major Japanese and European automakers, said an immediate elimination of U.S. automotive tariffs would help make U.S. auto production more competitive by increasing access to technology and components.
AG GROUPS: DON'T LIMIT TALKS
Japan is also seeking less than a full-range free trade agreement with only limited access to agriculture. In a joint statement issued in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the two sides said Japan would not offer any more access to the United States in agricultural, forestry and fishery products than it would have received in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump quit the TPP early in 2017.
But agriculture groups said USTR should push for more access to Japan for U.S. beef, pork, grains and dairy products.

""Don't limit the potential market access gains that may be possible,"" said Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy for the National Milk Producers Federation. She urged USTR to ""not set a precedent of prematurely capping trade benefits for American farmers and food manufacturers before negotiations begin in earnest.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering Republican Representative Mark Meadows, former campaign adviser David Bossie, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for White House chief of staff, a source familiar with the search said on Monday.
Another source said Trump was also looking at U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for the job.
The search comes after the president's initial choice for the job bowed out and as his White House braces for an onslaught of political and legal challenges in the coming year. 
On Saturday Trump announced that his current chief, General John Kelly, would be leaving the White House at the end of the year. The two men had clashed for months.
Trump's initial pick for the job, Nick Ayers, pulled out on Sunday. Ayers, who is Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, had agreed to come on for an interim period but declined to commit to stay for the remaining two years of Trump's term.
The new chief of staff will have to navigate a challenging political environment as Trump begins his third year in office and prepares for a 2020 re-election campaign. 
Democrats take over control of the House of Representatives in January, and U.S. prosecutors are intensifying their probe into potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Trump has denied any collusion, while calling the probe a ""witch hunt."" 
A White House official said Trump was considering four people for the position but declined to give names.
Other names that have come up for the job include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, but a person familiar with Mnuchin's thinking said he believed he could serve better in his current position.
White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is no longer interested in the job, said a source close to him, adding that he would prefer to serve at the Department of Commerce or Treasury ""if that's where the president needed him."" Neither of those cabinet-level secretary jobs are open at the moment. 
Lighthizer, meanwhile, has gained prominence in the administration for his handling of trade negotiations; he is the point person for talks between the administration and China over trade, an issue that is likely to dominate the first part of 2019 and beyond.
""The argument for Lighthizer is he'll be able to navigate trade negotiations - which could be a defining part of the presidency, and has run a major company,"" said one official familiar with the process. ""The argument for Meadows is [Trump] ultimately wants a political strategist going into 2020 - which Mark is.""
Meadows' spokesman Ben Williamson released a statement on Twitter from the lawmaker indicating his interest in the job.
""Serving as Chief of Staff would be an incredible honor. The President has a long list of qualified candidates and I know he'll make the best selection for his administration and for the country,"" the statement said.

Trump is expected to make a decision about the position by the end of the year.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo won't be allowed to grow unless problems fixed: Fed's Powell,"By Patrick Rucker and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) must keep a lid on its growth until the bank has hardened its risk management policies to prevent any further abuse of its customers, said Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
In February, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to freeze its balance sheet, keeping its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it put new checks on senior managers and gave the board new powers to sniff out abuses.
""We do not intend to lift the asset cap until remedies to these issues have been adopted and implemented to our satisfaction,"" Powell wrote in a letter to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren seen by Reuters.
Wells Fargo has so far failed to satisfy the Fed and the bank is months behind schedule on submitting an acceptable reform plan, Reuters reported last week.
A bank representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Powell's letter. Wells Fargo executives have previously said that they expect the cap to be lifted during the first half of next year.
Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been a vocal critic of Wells Fargo and its Chief Executive Tim Sloan. In October, Warren wrote a letter asking the regulator not to remove the asset cap until Sloan is removed, charging that Sloan was ""deeply implicated"" in the misdeeds of the past. Wells Fargo has called Sloan's 30-year tenure at the bank an asset and said he has the full support of its board.
On Monday, Warren faulted the bank for being late with its reform plan and said Sloan must go.
""Wells Fargo is already months behind,"" Warren said in a statement. ""If the Fed is serious about changing the practices at Wells Fargo that have cost customers their homes or cars or credit scores, it must insist on new leadership at the bank.""
The Wells Fargo sanctions were rooted in a sales practices scandal that broke open in 2016 when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. In his letter to Warren, Powell wrote that what happened inside the bank was ""outrageous,"" but declined to say whether or not Sloan should continue to lead the bank.
Since the phony accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has said it found abuses in auto insurance, small business loans, mortgage lending and other business lines.
Once Wells Fargo has satisfied the terms of the February settlement, Powell wrote, the Fed board will decide whether or not the bank can grow.

""The decision about terminating the asset growth restriction imposed on Wells Fargo will be made by a vote of the Board,"" Powell wrote in the Nov. 28 letter.

1. Wholesale Inflation Numbers Arrive
It’s time for inflation data again, starting off, as usual, with the latest on wholesale prices tomorrow.
The Labor Department will release the producer price index (PPI) for November at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the PPI remained flat last month. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to post a 0.1% drop for November.
Inflation gauges have looked tamer of late, adding to the argument that the Federal Reserve can back off its plan for steady rate hikes next year.
2. Dave & Buster’s, American Eagle Report Results
In a very light earnings calendar this week, attention tomorrow will be on results after the bell.
Restaurant and arcade chain Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) will be hoping for another strong report like the one in mid-September when it lifted guidance and shares spiked. The stock rallied short term after that, but has since been brought down by the broader selloff, trading lower than it was three months ago.
Analysts, on average, predict a profit of 24 cents per share on revenue of more than $277 million.
Clothing retailer  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) will also weigh in after the bell, with its stock down more than 20% from three months ago.
The Street is looking for a profit of 48 cents per share, with sales of about $1 billion.
3. Oil Market Dismissing OPEC’s Plans
While the stock market experienced whipsaw action today, the oil market was all about selling.
Crude oil prices settled down 3% and then kept tumbling, with WTI prices around $50.50 per barrel in late trading. That, in turn, kept energy stocks lower.
With the OPEC+ production cut now decided, there seems little to get in the way of oil bears tomorrow. Traders will likely be positioning ahead of Wednesday U.S. inventories data.
Strong U.S. production has taken away a lot of influence by OPEC, but the market will be watching geopolitical headlines to see any signs of further impediments to global economic growth on the U.S.-China trade and Brexit fronts."

651,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>","In a tight labor market, companies bet big on five-year rewards","By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the old days, longtime employees in the United States were honored with a gold watch after 30 years or so at a company.
Well, they have got nothing on Hadas Streit.
The senior vice president at the global public relations firm Allison + Partners recently returned from a one-month paid sabbatical, awarded to staffers after only five years at the company. During that time, she rented a house in Cape Cod for a couple of weeks.
Streit, who is based in New York, swears she did not check her work email once.
""The last time I wasn't working was back when I was a kid,"" says Streit. ""It's a little scary, but when you come back, you feel refreshed, with new drive, and ready to work again.""
Streit is not alone in enjoying some fast-tracked work recognition. Workplace anniversary awards are offered by 63 percent of companies, according to the 2018 Benefits Survey of the Society for Human Resource Management. And rewards rose 9 percent in a single year.
The five-year honor has taken particular hold in work cultures like Silicon Valley, where intense lifestyles and endless project deadlines can easily lead to employee burnout.
Social media giant Facebook (O:FB) has been offering its ""Recharge"" program since 2015: It is a 30-day period (the days have to be continuous, but do not have to be taken right at the five-year mark) which staffers can use as an ""uninterrupted break to refuel and relax,"" said Tudor Havriliuc, Facebook's vice president of compensation, benefits and global mobility.
So what is going on? Well, just take a look at the nation's employment situation: Joblessness is near historic lows, currently at 3.7 percent of the population, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a recent poll of small business owners, 37 percent reported having openings they could not even fill – the highest figure in the survey’s history, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.
At the same time, companies are reluctant to boost wages, in order to keep profits up. So, one way to honor employees and improve retention, without a huge wage hike, is the service anniversary award.
And since hardly anyone stays with a company 30 or 40 years these days, more companies are honoring longevity after only a few years on the job, when staffers are in their prime and most likely to be scouted by rival firms or executive recruiters.
HAPPY WORK ANNIVERSARY
“In today’s job market, there are more jobs than applicants, and the competition for top talent is greater than ever,” said Vanessa Hill, spokeswoman for the Society for Human Resource Management. “Organizations are identifying which compensation benefits are most helpful in getting employees in the door and keeping them – and service anniversary rewards are trending up.”
But it is not just sabbaticals that employees are enjoying after only a few years on the job. 
SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, which helps businesses find savings in their regular monthly expenditures, offers employees a fat check for $50,000 after they reach their 5-year work anniversary.
“The thought process was, people don’t stick around at jobs for a long time anymore,” said Dan Schneider, chief executive officer of the Charleston, South Carolina-based company. “A lot of times, people leave for a little more pay. So an award like this shows you can still grow within your company, and earn more money, without having to leave.”
Most companies might hold onto staffers for 24 months, Schneider said. By tempting employees with a gigantic check, his own firm now boasts average retention of four years.
Of course, as humans typically have bad money instincts, there is always the possibility that they might spend these milestone cash awards on unnecessary stuff. 
So, instead of using a cash gift to glam up your lifestyle, devote it to something else that will improve your situation for the long-term – like wiping out student debt, a downpayment for a house or a wedding, advises SIB’s Schneider.
And if it is a sabbatical you are entitled to, here is some advice from Hadas Streit: Use it. 
After all, the purpose is to have fun, recharge and come back reinvigorated. If you end up checking your work e-mail every five minutes, you are defeating the purpose – and cheating both yourself and your employer, Streit said.
""When I tell people I got a month off after five years on the job, folks are in shock because they never heard of that before,” she says. “I feel like I took a really long nap.”
(This version of the story corrects to ""most companies"" from ""most of SIB's competitors"" in paragraph 16 as the firm says it does not have competition)

655,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>","Google+ shutdown speeds up, new privacy bug affected 52.5 million users","By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said on Monday it would shut down its Google+ social media service in April, four months ahead of schedule, after finding a software flaw for the second time this year that allowed partner apps to access its users' private data.
However, Google said in a blog post that it found no evidence that any other apps had accessed the data, such as name, email, gender and age, using the latest bug. It affected 52.5 million Google+ accounts, including those of some business customers, for six days after it was introduced last month, Google said.
The disclosure comes a day before Chief Executive Sundar Pichai is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Congress about Google's data collection practices. Some U.S. lawmakers from both major political parties have called for new privacy rules to better control Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and other large technology companies.
In October, the company said it would shut down the consumer version Google+ in August 2019 because it would be too challenging to maintain the unpopular service. At the time, it said profile data from up to 500,000 users might have been exposed to partner apps by a bug that was present for more than two years.

Apps that pull data from Google+ to personalize their own services with user authorization will lose access in 90 days, the company said. Developing Google+ for business customers would remain a focus, it added.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>",Avianca seeks to cut Airbus order as much as half: CEO,"By Luis Jaime Acosta
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Airline Avianca Holdings SA (CN:AVT_p) will begin negotiations with Airbus (PA:AIR) to reduce the 100 planes it had agreed to purchase in a 2015 deal to as few as 50, the chief executive of the Latin American company said.
Avianca was also seeking a strategic alliance with German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), CEO Hernan Rincon said late on Sunday, part of its bid to expand in Europe.
Avianca representatives will travel to France in the coming days for re-negotiations with Airbus, Rincon said. Avianca had agreed to buy 100 A320neo planes to modernize its fleet.
""Of those 100, we'll probably receive between 50 and 80 planes,"" he said. ""We don't have any doubt that we will keep growing, what has changed is the rhythm of the growth.""
Technological advancement is part of the reason for the airline wanting to reduce its purchases, Rincon added.
""The rhythm of technology is changing, it will take a while to get all of the order and we don't want to have a commitment to planes with today's technology which will be received by us in 10 or 15 years,"" he said. 
A reduction in the original order, which was set to cost $10 billion, will also give Avianca some financial breathing room, Rincon added.
At the end of last month Avianca, United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and Copa Airlines of Panama said they had finalized a three-way joint venture that will allow them to plan routes and fares together and share revenues on those routes.
United, Avianca and Copa are already codeshare partners and Star Alliance members.
""We've started conversations with Lufthansa, but its very embryonic,"" said Rincon. ""We hope to reach an agreement to benefit our passengers in Europe, which is a relevant and growing market.""
The deal with Lufthansa would be similar to the one just agreed with United and Copa, Rincon added.
Under the United and Copa agreement, United said it would provide a $456 million term loan to cash-strapped Avianca's top shareholder, Synergy Group Corp. Loss-making Avianca has a roughly $4 billion debt pile, of which 40 percent is due within the next two years, according to recent financial statements.
That deal still has to be approved by regulators.

Avianca will also start operating a regional subsidiary in Colombia in 2019, meant to serve medium and small-sized cities with 12 ATR 42 planes. The planes are already part of Avianca's fleet, Rincon said.

The public prosecutor is accusing the former official of failing to report suspicious transactions, despite sufficient indications of money laundering, Hessischer Rundfunk reported, without citing sources.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Frankfurt prosecutor's office didn't answer the phone or return an email seeking comment.
Deutsche Bank shares hit a low on Friday and traded 4.4 percent lower at 1614 GMT. Shares are down 53 percent this year.
Last month, Police raided six Deutsche Bank premises in and around Frankfurt over money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers. 
The two-day search included all the offices of Deutsche Bank's management board.
Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor's office has said. The inquiries focus on events from 2013 to this year.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Deep losses in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc have left the former tech favorites at their lowest earnings multiples in years, offering potential bargains to cold-blooded investors looking to buy stocks at a time of heightened fear.
Plummeting stock prices in recent months have mostly outpaced a simultaneous decline in earnings expectations, presenting potential opportunities to buy beaten down stocks. But apparent bargains could turn out to be expensive if earnings expectations take a turn for the worse next year as the United States continues its trade dispute with China.
Since Apple's November forecast for a weaker-than-expected holiday shopping quarter and other reports of sluggish demand for iPhones, analysts have cut estimates for the Cupertino, California-based company's December-quarter net income by almost $1 billion. Apple's stock last week traded at a nearly two-year low of 13 times expected earnings, even after accounting for analysts' reduced expectations.

Already, the so-called FANG group of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet shares has seen its weight within the S&P 500 dwindle to 8 percent from as much as 10 percent in July, with investors fleeing what for years was Wall Street's most popular trade.

Since the U.S. stock market abruptly dropped in early October, Apple has lost a quarter of its value, and last week it relinquished its title as Wall Street's most valuable company to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since then, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have been battling to be No. 1.
Netflix has slumped 20 percent since early October, while Facebook and Amazon are both down over 10 percent. Alphabet, the least badly performing of the group, has lost 9 percent, a little worse than the S&P 500's 8 percent decline.

Investors in recent months have become increasingly worried that an ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict may hobble U.S. multinationals just as a year-long an surge in earnings growth caused by new corporate tax cuts is set to end. 
Tech investors have also become more concerned about a global smartphone market that is losing steam, but the resulting drop in Apple's stock has outpaced analysts' reduced earnings expectations. Apple and other big tech names are trading at the lowest multiples of their prices to expected earnings in years, suggesting recent selling might be overdone.
""There are some attractive buying opportunities,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""We are buying Microsoft, and we could add some Apple and some Alphabet at these levels."" 
(For a graphic on 'Wavering Faith in Apple, Facebook and Alphabet' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2QiFzRP)
Facebook, plagued for months by criticism of its use of people's personal data and fears that it could face more regulation, recently traded at 19 times expected earnings, its lowest ever. That compares to a multiple of 45 times after Facebook went public in 2012.
Amazon's stock is now trading at 64 times expected earnings, it lowest multiple since 2012. Netflix's price/earnings multiple has dropped to 68, its lowest since 2015.

Newly enacted corporate tax cuts supercharged U.S. earnings this year, but their effect on profit growth will end in the December quarter, leading analysts on average to predict S&P 500 earnings per share next year will rise 8 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The question going into 2019 is, 'Are you seeing enough of a pullback in those sectors that led that would entice investors to accept the lower valuations as an opportunity?'"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

The S&P 500 lost 47 points, or 1.8%, as of 11:24 AM ET (16:24 GMT), while the Dow decreased 482 points, or 2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 87 points, or 1.2%.
Ongoing trade tensions increased after Chinese officials summoned the U.S. ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest the arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese electronics giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada.
Despite a trade truce being declared earlier in the month, the U.S. has taken a hard stance, with a March 1 ""hard deadline"" to come up with a trade deal before tariffs kick in, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday.
Nearly every sector was down, lead by declines in the financial and energy sectors. The S&P 500 Financials index fell 2.9% amid expectations that the Federal Reserve won’t increase interest rates as fast next year due to slowing global economic growth.
The S&P 500 Energy index fell 3.2% as crude oil prices sank again.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell 4% while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) dipped 2.3% and Visa (NYSE:V) was down 1.5%.

The company had previously said it was being ""very proactive"" about the situation regarding tariffs as U.S. and China ramped up its bitter trade war, in which both nations have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's imports.
GoPro said international-bound camera production will remain in China.
""It's important to note that we own our own production equipment while our manufacturing partner provides the facilities, so we expect to make this move at a relatively low cost,"" said Chief Financial Officer Brian McGee.
In the company's earnings call in November, GoPro said it had the option to move U.S.-bound production out of China in the first half of 2019, if necessary.
GoPro has been trying to drive demand for its trademark action-cameras - once a must-have for surfers, skydivers and other action junkies — as competition ramps up.
Last month, the company forecast fourth-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates as it battles waning demand for its products.
The forecast was a disappointment as the company launched new low-price models of its flagship Hero camera for the holiday season.

However, GoPro said it would be profitable in the fourth quarter and expects ""low channel inventory"" to be well-positioned for the first quarter.

The collapse of the country's socialist economic system has decimated demand for consumer goods and left firms unable to import raw materials, leading companies ranging from Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) to Kellogg Co (N:K) to leave for good.
""A lawyer called from abroad to inform of that operations were being halted,"" said union leader Jorge Rodriguez in a telephone interview. ""The plant is open but nothing is functioning.""
Goodyear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company is making legally mandated severance payments and is giving each worker 10 tires, which are of enormous value due to chronic product shortages, it said in a letter written to workers.
""This letter is to inform that as of today, Goodyear de Venezuela has been forced to halt its operations,"" reads the letter.
Dozens of multinationals are hanging on in Venezuela by maintaining minimum operations, hoping for a turnaround in the country's fortunes.
Many survive by limiting their product lines, which economists and corporate advisors call a strategy to prepare for an eventual exit.

Asian markets kicked off what looks to be a bearish day for global stocks on Monday on growing concerns over global economic growth and the US-China trade war. European stocks and US futures also fell.
Tensions over trade between the US and China heightened even further as China summoned the Canadian and US ambassadors over the weekend regarding the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada last week. China has  described the arrest as ""lawless"" and ""extremely vicious.""
""Global stocks are set up for a rough ride this week after something of a drubbing last week,"" said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst for Markets.com. Markets tend to rise in a ""Santa rally"" in December; the S&P 500 has declined in December only four times since 2002.
US equity futures were trading lower on Monday. The Nasdaq was down 0.4%, while the Dow and S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 4.6% for the month. If it closed at that level come New Year's Eve, it would be the worst since 2002, when the index slumped 6%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.8% as investors fret about a continued war of words. Weak Chinese inflation figures and continued concerns about trade weighed on equities. Chinese goods-exports growth slowed to 5.4% year-on-year in November from 15.6% in October. 
The Nikkei slumped 2.4% after data showed that Japan's economy  contracted by more than expected in the third quarter.
European markets also slumped, with Germany's DAX index down 1.2% amid uncertainty about the German economy.  Weak export data and a poor year for the country's powerhouse automotive industry aren't helping the German cause. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is  under pressure and facing a massive defeat on a crucial Brexit vote that could endanger her job.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 had dropped 0.6% at 9:56 a.m. in London (4:56 a.m. ET).
In France, the ongoing ""Yellow Vest"" protests are slowing the country's economy, with the Bank of France predicting 0.2% growth in the fourth quarter,  down from an estimate of 0.4%.
Investors in the US are also still jittery about the Treasury ""yield curve,"" a wonky market event that can signal a recession. The outlook between the two-year and 10-year government bonds stayed flat, but investors are concerned the curve will invert, which would add weight to any forecasts for a slump in growth.
""Bond markets have been more accurate than stock markets in predicting economic slowdowns,"" said Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at ForexTime. ""It looks like a matter of time before the long end of the curve inverts too. While this doesn't necessarily indicate a recession is imminent, it's a bold warning signal.""

(Reuters) - Shares in  Interserve  (L:IRV) lost more than half their value on Monday after the British support services provider said it was in rescue talks which may hand control of the company to creditors in a bid to avoid a Carillion-style collapse.
The Reading-based outsourcer, which employs 75,000 worldwide and has thousands of UK government contracts to clean hospitals and serve school meals, said on Sunday it would seek to cut its debt to 1.5 times core earnings in talks with lenders it hopes to complete early next year. 
Chief Executive Debbie White said that the company was trading well and in line with expectations for 2018, and that the debt reduction plan, first floated in a refinancing in April, had government support.
But the moves add to the sense of crisis around the company, whose value has slumped from over a billion pounds in 2014 to just 9.7 million pounds ($12.4 million).
Carillion's (L:CLLN) collapse in a mass of debt and pensions dues in January forced the government to step in to guarantee services ranging from roadworks to school meals and led to a parliamentary inquiry into the extent to which private companies should be running essential services.
Prime Minister Theresa May faces a 148 million pound bill from the collapse, according to estimates from the National Audit Office and her government now wants the likes of  Serco  (L:SRP) and Capita (L:CPI) to show that contracts can be transferred to peers if they fail. 
Interserve's combined credit score, which measures on a scale of 100 to 1 how likely a company is to default on its debts in the next year, was ""1"", according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating it was expected to default. 
""While trading is in line we believe that it is hard for Interserve to get credit insurance or win new contracts, given the current environment and its leverage,"" Liberum analyst Joe Brent, said.
""We struggle to see any scenario, which leaves much, or any value, for the current equity … valuation is close to irrelevant given the financial risks."" 
GOING UNDERGROUND
Interserve, which maintains eight out of 10 of Britain's busiest railway stations and cleans 2,490 London Underground carriages every evening, warned in November that its debt would rise more than expected this year. 
It said then that it expected year-end net debt in a range of 625 million pounds to 650 million pounds ($795-$830 million), citing project delays and a weak construction market.
Sky News reported https://news.sky.com/story/interserve-lenders-hire-lazard-amid-600m-rescue-bid-11576979 on Monday that the firm's creditors had hired Lazard to advise on the terms of a 600 million pound rescue deal. Lazard and Interserve did not immediately respond to request for comment on the report. 
Separately, the BBC cited sources close to Interserve's creditors as saying that lenders recognized they may have to write off some of the loans to stave off a collapse but still supported company management.
UK trade union Unite, which has 1,200 members working at the firm, said it would support opposition Labour Party proposals to ban the company from bidding for public contracts until its future is clear, also calling for ministers to lay out contingency plans. 
""We could be facing  Carillion  Mark Two,"" Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail, said https://unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2018/december/interserve-could-be-carillion-mark-two-unite-warns. 
Another major contractor,  Kier Group  (L:KIE), announced a surprise plan two weeks ago to tap shareholders for 264 million pounds, blaming the reluctance of banks to lend to builders. 
Danish support services company ISS (CO:ISS) on Monday announced its own plan to raise up to 2.5 billion Danish crowns ($381 million) from selling businesses. 
""The phrase ‘too big to fail’ will inevitably be trotted out (for Interserve),"" said Julie Palmer, a partner at restructuring consultants Begies Traynor. 
""But it is going to be sensible management and sound financially grounded decisions that help this giant of a company survive long-term. It can’t just keep receiving financial adrenaline through rescue packages.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrero SpA is interested in buying  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) international business, which includes biscuit brand Arnott's, two sources close to the matter said on Monday.
The Italian group based in the Piedmont region is working on a possible deal with Rothschild as advisers, one of the sources said, confirming an earlier report by Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore. According to the newspaper, the deal could be worth more than $2 billion.
Campbell started the process of selling its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units in August following a strategic review, joining the likes of other packaged food makers such as Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) and Kellogg Co (N:K) who have also been offloading some brands.
Campbell recently settled a months-long proxy battle with billionaire Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC, which had pressured the company to sell itself.
The company said last month, the units which were put up for sale have attracted strong interest from potential buyers.
Campbell's international biscuits and snacks operating segment also include Kelsen Group, along with the company's manufacturing operations in Indonesia, Malaysia and its businesses in Hong Kong and Japan. 

Ferrero, which also makes Kinder brand chocolates and Tic Tac, declined to comment, while a Campbell spokesman said the company does not comment on rumors and speculation.

The sale would allow Banco BPM to reduce its problem loan ratio to as low as 10.6 percent of total lending from 16 percent at the end of September, putting to rest concerns the bank may need to raise capital to clean up its balance sheet.
The board of Italy's third-largest bank will meet later on Monday to pick the winner of the race in which Credito Fondiario and Elliott were up against Italy's top bad loan specialist  doBank  (MI:DOB), backed by U.S. private equity firm Fortress, and a third group comprising U.S. funds TPG, Christofferson, Robb & Company and Davidson Kempner.
All the parties involved declined to comment.
Banco BPM earlier this month struck a consumer credit agreement with  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) which helped to boost the Italian bank's capital, paving the way for this latest bad loan deal. [nL8N1Y607C]
Problem loans are normally sold at a loss, which depletes a bank's capital reserves. A source involved the bidding process told Reuters last month Banco BPM's bad loans were being valued at a fifth of their gross book value.
Banco BPM's latest efforts to clean up its balance sheet had run into difficulties due to a sharp rise in state borrowing costs under the country's eurosceptic government, which has made foreign investors nervous and hit the value of banks' sovereign bond holdings.
Like other Italian banks, Banco BPM had seen its core capital eroded by the falling value of its domestic government bond holdings in the three months through June.
This has added to pressure on Banco BPM's shares, which trade at an almost 70 percent discount to its assets.
However, the bank managed to bolster its capital levels in the third quarter with an asset sale and accounting changes.[nFWN1XI11M]
It gained a further capital benefit by selling part of its ProFamily consumer financing business to the Agos consumer credit joint-venture it has in place with Credit Agricole for 310 million euros ($352.66 million).
Created last year from the merger of Banca Popolare di Milano and  Banco Popolare  , Banco BPM has already offloaded 11.5 billion euros in bad loans since the end of 2016.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The growing ranks of stock market Eeyores now have another reason to stay glum: Next year's profit picture is darkening fast.
Corporate earnings forecasts are eroding as the tailwind from the tax cut fades and as investors worry the U.S.-China trade dispute could upend global commerce more than it already has.
Even after the second correction of the year for the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index, many investors wonder whether share prices adequately reflect risks of slower profit growth. 
Emblematic of the recent turbulence, last week the S&P 500 slid 4.6 percent. The previous week it notched its biggest weekly gain in nearly seven years.
Wall Street analysts have slammed the brakes on estimates for profit growth for S&P 500 companies, which had accelerated for much of the year. Two months ago, 2019 profit growth was pegged at 10.2 percent; it is now seen at 8.2 percent, and growing ranks of doubters reckon growth could slow to half that rate or less.
""It may be more in the line of 3 to 4 percent,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, adding the market has yet to price that in.
""The risk to that estimate is the downside. Right now, the equity market is focused more on trade than they are earnings.""
Morgan Stanley's outlook warned of more than a 50 percent chance of a ""modest earnings recession,"" or two quarters of year-over-year profit declines. That last occurred when earnings declined for four straight quarters starting in the third quarter of 2015.
In recent weeks, top strategists at RBC Capital Markets,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) have forecast 2019 earnings per share growth below the rate compiled by Refinitiv, an aggregate of estimates from analysts covering individual companies.
Among the deepest profit downgrades have been for the technology and communications sectors that had carried the market higher through the latest stages of the bull market.
Tech delivered third-quarter earnings per share growth of 29.2 percent from a year earlier, but the latest forecasts for next year's third quarter see that plunging to 2.2 percent and averaging just over 4.9 percent for all of 2019. [L1N1YB25L]
The recently formed communication services sector, which includes such heavyweights as Facebook (O:FB) and other social media companies facing increased regulatory scrutiny, is now expected to deliver profit growth of 6.7 percent in 2019, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 11.6 percent. 
""Tech earnings will be there. They're just not going to lead,"" said Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management.

SHIFT IN OUTLOOK
Strong earnings and economic growth had helped stocks rebound from steep drops in February and kept most investors optimistic about market valuations. At the time, earnings forecasts were rising fast as companies were ramping up buybacks and spending plans following hefty tax cuts approved by Congress in late 2017.
Near the end of 2018, the bond market has been flashing warning signs about a possible economic slowdown, while investors fret about nagging trade tensions.
Strategists now fear the economy could slow while interest rates are still rising. Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates in December for a fourth time this year, but the focus is on how many rate hikes will follow in 2019. 
Another concern for stocks: companies have been warning for a couple of months about rising wages eating into profit margins.
Some strategists did cite reduced profit growth forecasts as one of the reasons stocks sold off recently. The S&P 500 is trading at 15.8 times forward earnings compared with 17.3 at the start of October, according to Refinitiv data. 
Others said earnings growth, even at a much-reduced rate, will be healthy enough to support the market.
""Where we're getting to is a healthy, sustainable level from something that was running really very hot,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. chief investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities. He said analysts also tend to overestimate long-range profit growth, so investors should not be surprised by reduced forecasts.
Semiconductor-related companies including Micron Technology (O:MU), Applied Materials (O:AMAT) and Lam Research (O:LRCX) are the biggest drags on tech earnings estimates for 2019, while  DISH Network  Corp (O:DISH) is among the biggest weights on communication services, based on Refinitiv data.
Global demand for chips has been slowing, and investors are concerned the U.S. President Donald Trump could enact tariffs on imports of electronics products manufactured in China that are made with chips from U.S. companies. 

Technology and communication services stocks have been among the hardest hit this quarter, with the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) down more than 14 percent since the end of September.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 06:45AM ET</span>","Ghosn, Nissan formally charged in financial misconduct scandal","By Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo prosecutors indicted ousted Nissan Motor (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn for under-reporting his income and also officially charged the automaker, making the firm culpable for the financial misconduct scandal that has shocked the industry.
Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of conspiring to understate his compensation by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million) over five years from 2010. 
He has been held in a Tokyo jail since then for questioning, but had not been officially charged until now. Prosecutors re-arrested him on Monday on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018. 
Nissan, which fired Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest, has said the misconduct was masterminded by the once-celebrated executive with the help of former Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also indicted for the first time on Monday.
Ghosn and Kelly have not made any statement through their lawyers, but Japanese media reported that they have denied the allegations. Calls to Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, at his office went unanswered.
Nissan, indicted for filing false financial statements, said it takes the charge seriously.
""Making false disclosures in annual securities reports greatly harms the integrity of Nissan's public disclosures in the securities markets, and the company expresses its deepest regret,"" it said, adding it will correct past financial reports to include appropriate compensation figures. 
Japan's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC), said the crime carried a fine of up to 700 million yen ($6.2 million). 
Analysts and legal experts say it will be difficult for Nissan and its Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa to avoid blame, regardless of whether other executives knew about Ghosn's misconduct or that the company lacked internal controls.
""It becomes difficult to overlook Saikawa's role in all of this. That becomes the main focus now,"" prominent lawyer and former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said.
Ghosn, if convicted, faces up to 10 years in prison and/or 10 million yen in fines under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
FALL FROM GRACE
Ghosn's arrest marks a dramatic fall for a leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. 
The once-feted executive has been treated like others in detention, held in a small chilly room. Authorities have limited his opportunities to shower and shave, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Asked about criticism that Japanese prosecutors often try to force confessions from suspects, deputy prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Shin Kukimoto, said no such method was being used with Ghosn and Kelly.
""Questioning is by no means being conducted in a way that forces confession,"" he told a news conference. ""It's my understanding that both of them are being treated appropriately at the Tokyo Detention Center.""
The arrest of Ghosn and Kelly has shaken up the foundations of the Renault-Nissan alliance. 
While the Japanese automaker has stepped up its offensive against Ghosn, seeking to block access by his representatives to an apartment in Rio de Janeiro citing a risk that the executive may remove or destroy evidence, the European partner has kept him on as its chairman and CEO.
The key question is whether and how the ownership structure of the alliance might change. Ghosn, under pressure from the French government, had pushed for a deeper tie-up including a possible full merger between  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan, despite strong reservations at Nissan.
Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over the Japanese automaker, which dwarfs Renault in vehicle sales. 

Renault holds around 43 percent of Nissan, while Nissan has a non-voting 15 percent stake in the French partner.

Profits this year would decrease in the range of 15%-to-20% compared to 2017, BASF said. The firm had previously forecast a decline of up to 10% in 2018.
The company cited a drop in chemical prices, while low water levels on the Rhine and weak automotive demand especially in China were also to blame.
Shares in BASF plunged by as much as 5.5% after the open to touch their lowest level since early 2016. It was last down around 5% by 6:40AM ET (11:40 GMT).
BASF peers K+S AG (DE:SDFGn),  Symrise AG  (DE:SY1G), and  Lanxess  AG (DE:LXSG) all dropped by at least 3% in Frankfurt.
Elsewhere across the continent, Switzerland-based Sika AG (SIX:SIKA) lost 4%, while  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) sank 6% in Paris.
The losses helped to drag the pan-European Stoxx 600 Chemicals index down almost 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the day.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Stock selloff snowballs on fresh fears for world growth,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Losses on global stocks snowballed on Monday, with European markets following Asian peers lower as fresh signs emerged of slowing growth worldwide and fears grew that simmering U.S.-China tensions would torpedo chances of a trade deal.
Wall Street was set to open lower, futures indicated, after New York-listed shares posted their biggest weekly decline since March.
""Another day, another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining,"" said Stephen Innes at brokerage OANDA 
MSCI's all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) has spent four weeks in the red, despite intermittent rallies fueled by hopes of trade war detente. The pessimism has been exacerbated by data showing the world's largest economies -- the United States, China, Japan and Germany -- are all headed for slower growth.
That pushed the index 0.5 percent lower, while a pan-European index (STOXX) fell almost one percent by 0930 GMT and U.S. equity futures (ESc1)  were down 0.5 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session.
Last week's arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States was seen putting up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said Sunday there was a ""hard deadline"" to the 90-day trade ceasefire and without a successful end to talks by March 1, Washington would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods.
""The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties,"" said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo.
Economic data has disappointed, too, underscoring the impact of the trade wars on the world economy.
Following weak trade and inflation data on the weekend, China posted far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reinforcing expectations Beijing will roll out more stimulus to prevent the economy cooling too fast.
However, the yuan sagged to a one-week low after the weak data .
""(The data) would suggest China woes go well beyond U.S. tariffs, given that China trade surplus to the U.S. was at a record level. One can only imagine the impact on China terms of trade if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff,"" Innes of OANDA said.
Japan posted the worst contraction in over four years in the third quarter as uncertainty over global demand and trade saw companies slashing capital spending.
MSCI's index of Asian equities outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slid 1.5 percent to a near three-week low, Shanghai shares (SSEC) retreated 0.6 percent and Japan's Nikkei (N225) shed 2.1 percent. Emerging-market stocks lost 1.3 percent (MSCIEF).
Asia's data came after investors were spooked last week by below-forecast industrial output numbers in Germany and U.S. jobs data showing employers hired fewer workers than expected in November.
The slowdown signs also have pummelled oil prices, which have slumped around 30 percent since early October. Brent futures rose 0.2 percent to $61.90 a barrel after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers announced a supply cut.
DATA AND DOLLAR, PARLIAMENT AND PROTESTS 
The U.S. jobs data weakened the dollar by convincing many that U.S. growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening sooner than previously thought. Last week, the dollar posted its worst performance since August against a basket of currencies. (DXY) 
The dollar was a touch firmer on Monday but stayed near two-week lows. The euro rose 0.3 percent at $1.1418 (EUR=EBS). 
European investors were keeping their eyes on events in Britain and France. 
Sterling inched lower, heading back towards 17-month lows hit last week  versus the dollar, as British Prime Minister Theresa May's European Union divorce deal looks set to be rejected by parliament in a Tuesday vote.
While that raises fears of a chaotic exit in March, those hoping for a no-Brexit outcome were encouraged by a ruling from the EU's top court that Britain can revoke its decision to leave the bloc without the consent of other EU members.
France, meanwhile, suffered a fourth weekend of anti-government riots, which the finance minister said could curb economic growth by 0.1 percentage point. 
French hotel, transport and retail stocks fell. The yield premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German peers rose to the highest since May.
President Emmanuel Macron, already forced to row back on fuel tax increases, will make a televised address at 1900 GMT.
""Concern about a bit of political and fiscal capitulation is rarely good for a bond market,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",SoftBank's record IPO reaches $23.5 billion after extra share sale,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is set to raise 2.65 trillion yen ($23.5 billion) in Japan's biggest-ever IPO - a share sale widely regarded as finalizing the group's transition from domestic telco to a monolithic global tech investor.
Telco unit SoftBank Corp <9434.T> on Monday priced its stock at 1,500 yen apiece, as previously indicated.
It also said it will sell all extra shares set aside for excess demand, taking the total just shy of the record $25 billion raised in 2014 by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), a SoftBank Group portfolio company.
The group, which controls the world's biggest tech private equity fund at nearly $100 billion, will use the proceeds to invest in startups which have ranged from tiny games makers to U.S. ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].
""Demand was well above the number of shares on offer,"" SoftBank Corp said, declining to disclose by how much.
The stock will debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section on Dec. 19.
TROUBLED BACKDROP
The IPO pricing comes just days after Japan's third-largest mobile phone network provider by subscriber numbers suffered a rare nationwide service outage. SoftBank said the disruption would not affect its earnings or dividend forecast.
But other causes of concern abound. The government wants to see a decline in mobile phone charges just as competition is set to increase with the market entrance next year of e-commerce firm  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755).
Moreover, Tokyo plans to ban government purchases of telecommunications equipment from Chinese maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], sources have told Reuters. SoftBank has a long relationship with Huawei that has included joint trials of fifth-generation (5G) network technology.
On Monday, Kyodo News reported that SoftBank will no longer use Huawei equipment for its current network as well as in 5G. The firm told Reuters it was closely watching government policy.
Earlier in the IPO process, SoftBank Group's ties to Saudi Arabia - whose contribution makes up almost half of its massive Vision fund - caused investors to sweat after Saudi security forces were implicated in the murder of a dissident journalist.
RETAIL INVESTORS
SoftBank offered nearly 2 billion shares for sale raising concern of oversupply, particularly as it is widely perceived to be a mature business with consequently limited growth prospects.
It allocated over 80 percent of the sale for domestic retail investors, banking sources have said. To stimulate interest, the deal's domestic lead underwriters pursued an unprecedented marketing campaign - including what are believed to be Japan's first TV adverts for a private firm's IPO.
""Retail investors see IPO stocks as profitable,"" said Naoto Akashi, general manager at SBI Securities, Japan's biggest online brokerage and one of the lead underwriters for the domestic portion of SoftBank's IPO.
""In popular IPOs, there are several cases this year in which we received orders worth over 1 trillion yen for a single deal during book-building period,"" he said, declining to comment specifically on SoftBank.
Kazuto Hayashi, chief executive of smartphone brokerage startup One Tap BUY, said the IPO also attracted many young investors, some participating in an IPO for the first time.
Still, brokerages said they would be able to attract enough investors with SoftBank's dividend alone. SoftBank likely set its indicative share price at 1,500 yen - rather than a price range, as is the norm - to keep its dividend yield among the highest in Japan at 5 percent, brokerages said.

O'Day, now head of Roche's pharmaceuticals business, joined the company in 1987 and held various roles in the United States before moving in 1998 to headquarters in Basel, Switzerland.
O'Day's hiring comes about four months after Gilead said in July that Chief Executive John Milligan and Chairman John Martin would step down at the end of the year.
Jefferies analysts said in a note that O'Day's three decades of oncology and global commercial expertise at Roche should help Gilead build out its own global presence, particularly in new areas it is entering including oncology and inflammation as well as through more acquisitions and in-licensing deals.
At Roche, O'Day was a champion of bi-specific antibodies that are under development as a potentially less expensive, less complicated alternative to CAR-T therapy where T cells must be taken out of the body, re-engineered and re-infused. 
With Gilead's Yescarta therapy, O'Day is now on the opposite side of the divide.
Separately, Roche said William Anderson, current CEO of its Genentech business, would replace O'Day next year.
Anderson joined Roche in 2006, leading the immunology business unit in Genentech, and then took charge of oncology sales and marketing. In 2013, he became head of global product strategy based in Basel before assuming his current role at Genentech in 2017.
Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider called Anderson a ""seasoned Roche manager"" who played a key role in leading multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus to success and driving double-digit growth in the U.S. market.
Gilead said on Monday that Martin would step down from the company's board of directors, effective March 1, 2019.
Up to Friday's close, the company's shares have fallen nearly 14 percent since Milligan and Martin's departures were announced by Gilead in July.
The Wall street Journal first reported O'Day's hiring on Sunday.
Gilead said its board had appointed Gregg Alton as interim chief executive for the period of January 1, 2019 until O'Day's start date of March 1, 2019.

Roche shares were down 0.6 percent by mid-morning, in line with the Stoxx European health care sector index.

LONDON (Reuters) - Simmering U.S-Chinese trade tensions dented European shares on Monday as investors fled risk at the start of a highly uncertain week, with Britain's parliamentary vote on Brexit also looming and chemicals stocks dented by a BASF profit warning.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.9 percent to hit a fresh two-year low, with Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) down 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.8 percent at around 0930 GMT.
Oil stocks (SXEP) fell 1.1 percent, erasing their 2018 gains. Oil had been the last sector holding onto gains in Europe, and all the STOXX 600 sector indices are now in the red (with falls of 26 percent for autos and banks) or flat on the year.
Shaunak Mazumder, a senior fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said a combination of worries about the U.S.-China trade row and the Brexit vote was weighing on the market. 
""The market is lacking proper conviction. If the U.S.-China issue blows over, that could give support to the market. But it's difficult to call,"" he added. 
Shares in BASF (DE:BASFn) fell 4.7 percent after the German chemicals firm slashed its forecast for 2018 profits on Friday.
It said the decline was mainly due to its chemicals business, while low water levels on the Rhine and weak automotive demand especially in China were also to blame. 
BASF peer Symrise (DE:SY1G) also tumbled 3.1 percent, Sika (S:SIKA) fell 5.1 percent and  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) lost 5 percent, helping to drag the pan-European chemicals index (SX4P) down 2.5 percent and making it the worst-performing sector.
Construction and materials stocks (SXOP), also highly sensitive to economic growth, fell 1.5 percent, while autos stocks (SXAP) declined 1.3 percent as trade tensions took their toll. 
Unless U.S.-China trade talks wrap up successfully by March 1, new tariffs will be imposed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday, clarifying there is a ""hard deadline"".
Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) fell 2.9 to 5.1 percent as investors ditched the tech sector.
Outside of trade, politics drove some of the biggest moves. 
French retail, hotel, and transport stocks tumbled anew after a fourth weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests which are disrupting the economy.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among the biggest drags on the STOXX. But France's CAC 40 (FCHI) overall did not underperform European peers, down just 0.6 percent. 
Shares in British energy utilities  Centrica  (L:CNA) and SSE (L:SSE) fell around 3 percent as investors held their breath ahead of a crucial vote on Brexit on Tuesday. 
Traders said a Sunday Telegraph report flagging a risk Centrica may struggle to pay its dividend was also hurting sentiment. 
British housebuilders Berkeley Group (L:BKGH),  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) fell 1.5 to 2.5 percent as nerves built and Peel Hunt cut its ratings.
Outside large-cap moves, shares in  Interserve  (L:IRV) plunged as much as 71 percent, last trading down 51 percent, after the embattled British outsourcer said it was in talks with debtholders and considering converting debt to equity.

It is also focusing on building its priority and premium retail banking businesses, one of the sources said.
The bank has eight branches in the UAE, its website shows.

Chief Executive Bill Winters is overseeing a broader strategic overhaul at the bank aimed at reining in costs and delivering better returns in the medium term.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest pension fund, AustralianSuper, said it will vote against the executive pay of three of the country's biggest banks, in a show of the investment community's souring attitude toward the sector following a year-long misconduct probe.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), the country's second-largest lender, would be first to receive AustralianSuper's protest vote at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.
The pension fund said it would also vote against the executive pay plans of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) in the coming weeks.
""AustralianSuper is disappointed at the approach taken by the boards at ANZ, NAB and Westpac over executive remuneration and will be voting against them at the upcoming AGMs,"" Ian Silk, AustralianSuper chief executive officer, said in a statement.
""In what has been an annus horribilis for the banking sector, there has been a distinct lack of transparency from the banks around their rationale for paying executive bonuses this year.""
Under Australian corporate rules, if more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a pay proposal for two years running, they can call for the board to be removed.
With about A$8 billion ($5.8 billion) of retirement savings invested in the shares of large banks, AustralianSuper holds 2 percent to 2.5 percent of each of the four major lenders.
A powerful Royal Commission inquiry this year exposed major misconduct in Australia's financial industry, including allegations of rip-offs, mistreatment of customers, deception of regulators and even taking money from the dead.
The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which advises pension funds on how to vote at shareholder meetings, is also urging others to vote against bank executive pay.
""The question we are asking is, what do they have to do not to get a bonus?"" Louise Davidson, ACSI chief executive told Reuters.
Australian banks have said they would cut bonuses by 20 percent to 40 percent in response to the inquiry's findings, however Davidson said this was not enough.
Representatives of Westpac and NAB were not immediately available for comment. ANZ declined to comment.
No. 1 lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) held its annual general meeting in September, before AustralianSuper announced its protest vote. At CBA's AGM, just 5.8 percent of investors voted against its remuneration plans.

776,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Google, Facebook Face Australia Crackdown Over Market Power","(Bloomberg) -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). face a regulatory crackdown in Australia after the nation’s competition watchdog joined a chorus of international criticism over their use of data and the market power they wield across news and advertising.
In a preliminary report released Monday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said a new or existing watchdog should investigate and monitor how large digital platforms rank and display adverts and news. It also expressed concern about a lack of transparency in how their key algorithms work.
“The ACCC considers that the strong market position of digital platforms like Google and Facebook justifies a greater level of regulatory oversight,” Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The report contains 11 preliminary recommendations and eight areas for further analysis as the inquiry continues.
The tech giants have come under increased scrutiny internationally amid concern about the dissemination of fake news and their potential to dominate online advertising. U.S. lawmakers have lambasted Facebook for failing to stop a flood of Russian propaganda during the 2016 election, while European regulators are looking at the advertising practices of digital platforms.
Echoing such concerns, the ACCC said Google and Facebook had become the “dominant gateways between news media businesses and audiences,” leading to a loss of advertising revenue and ultimately cuts in the number of journalists who could play an important role in “exposing corruption and holding governments, companies, powerful individuals and institutions to account.”
The competition watchdog said its “preliminary view is that consumers face a potential risk of filter bubbles, or echo chambers, and less reliable news on digital platforms.”
A lack of transparency in key algorithms makes it difficult to know if the tech giants are favoring their own business interests over advertisers using the platforms, the ACCC said.
Google and Facebook didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking a response to the ACCC’s report.
The government isn’t expected to act on the ACCC’s recommendations until the final report is issued in June.
“Digital platforms have changed the way media content is produced, distributed and consumed,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement on Monday. “To make the most of opportunities that digital platforms bring, and to provide the right safeguards for the community, it is important that the regulatory environment remains fit-for-purpose.”
The ACCC’s preliminary report comes days after Australia’s parliament passed some of the world’s toughest anti-encryption legislation to force tech companies to help decode messages on services such as WhatsApp when they are used in terrorism and organized crime.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors managing $32 trillion in assets have called on governments to accelerate steps to combat climate change, as policymakers meet for talks at a United Nations conference in Poland.
A total of 415 investors from across the world including UBS Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments signed the 2018 Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change demanding urgent action.
""The global shift to clean energy is underway, but much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low carbon transition and to improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system to climate risks,"" the statement said.
The intervention is the single largest on the topic to date, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change said, as talks continue in the Polish city of Katowice to agree how to slow global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.
That goal was agreed at a 2015 meeting in Paris, but investors said national governments were being too slow in enacting the policies needed to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy.
Failure to act could lead to permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impact of the financial crisis, British asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR) said.
As well as ramping up the involvement of the private sector, governments needed to commit to improving climate-related financial reporting, a move that would help investors better assess the risk and allocate capital to the right companies.
""The reality is that the long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many,"" said Chris Newton, Executive Director Responsible Investment, IFM Investors.
""This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic.""
Among specific policy requests, the group called for governments to phase out thermal coal, put a ""meaningful"" price on carbon emissions and gradually get rid of subsidies for fossil fuels.
Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the U.S. government will pull out of the Paris deal and has looked to talk up the country's coal industry, policies Thomas DiNapoli of the New York State Common Retirement Fund called ""misguided"".
""Global efforts to address the very real threat climate risk presents to the economy, financial markets and investment returns are ongoing... (we) remain committed to supporting the Paris Agreement's climate goals.

""The transition to a low carbon economy presents numerous opportunities to create value and investors who ignore the changing world do so at their own peril,"" said DiNapoli, whose fund manages $207 billion in assets.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>",Hong Kong on track for global IPO crown but many new listings sag,"By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong is on course to take the global IPO crown this year for the most money raised in stock market flotations, narrowly ahead of arch-rival New York, but its new listings have posted the worst performance among leading bourses, data show. 
The figures are a blow to Hong Kong, whose hopes of a listings bonanza spurred by new tech-friendly rules have been dented by weak markets, sparking fears the soggy performance could weigh on initial public offering (IPO) volumes in 2019. 
Several companies have in recent weeks cut the size of their offerings, while others have held back from floating in the hope of a better environment later.
Companies listing in Hong Kong have sold shares worth $31.4 billion so far this year, the highest total in eight years, compared with $30.2 billion on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), according to Dealogic data.
But just six of the biggest 20 IPOs in Hong Kong that have begun trading were above their offer prices a month after debut, the data show, compared with 16 on the NYSE and 10 on Nasdaq.
Two of Hong Kong's biggest deals,  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690), which raised $9.7 billion between them, are down 19 percent and 26 percent respectively since their floats in July and September. 
Hong Kong has been hit by volatility stemming from concerns over a U.S.-China trade war and by slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy.
INVESTING PERSPECTIVE
The city's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) has fallen 13 percent this year, while the Shanghai Composite index (SSE) has dropped more than 20 percent. In the United States the S&P 500 is up 0.8 percent.
""From an investing perspective it's obviously been terrible,"" said a Hong Kong-based investor at a major asset manager. 
""A lot of these companies are very interesting, they're really attractive ... and I think there's been a certain amount of ... fear of missing out,"" the person said, referring to investors' continued participation in IPOs despite their performance.
Hong Kong has hosted a series of Chinese tech floats after a change in its listing rules in April to allow dual-class shares, brought in to avoid a repeat of Chinese e-commerce group  Alibaba  (N:BABA) picking New York in 2014 for its record $25 billion IPO because Hong Kong would not accept its unusual control structure.
Bankers said a factor in the soggy post-IPO performance was a reluctance by many company founders to accept lower valuations, meaning many deals priced high. Xiaomi for instance, valued at $54 billion in its July IPO, had been seeking a valuation of more than $70 billion as recently as May. 
Bankers however took comfort from the renewed interest this year in Hong Kong listings among global institutions, many of which had previously been deterred by a parade of unexciting Chinese state-owned enterprises that dominated local IPOs. 

""That (poor performance) is symptomatic of the process of re-institutionalisation of the Hong Kong market and that is going to take time,"" said a senior equity capital markets banker. ""It was never likely to be particularly smooth.""

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is fighting to be released on bail after she was arrested on Dec. 1 in Canada at the request of the United States.
Meng, 46, faces U.S. accusations that she covered up her company's links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions, a Canadian prosecutor said on Friday, arguing against giving her bail while she awaits extradition to the United States.
In a sworn affidavit, Meng said she is innocent of the allegations and will contest them at trial in the United States if she is surrendered there. 
Meng also said she was taken to a hospital for treatment for hypertension after being detained.
China has strongly criticized her detention and demanded her immediate release. The arrest has roiled global markets amid worries it could torpedo possible thawing of trade tensions between the United States and China.
In a bail application seeking her release pending an extradition hearing, Meng said she has longstanding ties to Vancouver dating back at least 15 years, as well as significant property holdings in the city. 

Her family also sought leave to remain in Vancouver if she was granted bail, according to the court documents, with her husband saying he plans to bring the couple's daughter to Vancouver to attend school during the trial.

The plan, which is not yet finalised, might see part of the new equity sold to existing shareholders and potentially to other investors, the company, which has around 75,000 employees worldwide, said in a statement.
""If implemented in this form, the deleveraging plan could result in material dilution for current Interserve shareholders,"" Interserve said.
Proposals were also being discussed to amend Interserve's financing agreements, including extending the maturity dates of existing loans, it said.
Support service companies have been under scrutiny in Britain with questions asked about whether private companies should be running essential public services after Carillion Plc collapsed in January, triggering Britain's biggest corporate failure in a decade and forcing the government to step in to guarantee public services from school meals to roadworks.
Interserve warned in November that its debt would rise more than expected this year amid project delays and a weak construction market, and said it would launch plans to cut borrowing in early 2019.
Under the deleveraging plan being discussed with lenders, Interserve would target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 times, it said on Sunday.
Interserve said it continued to trade well and in line with its expectations for the year ending Dec. 31.
""We are making good progress on our deleveraging plan which we expect to announce early in 2019. Our lenders are supportive of the deleveraging plan which will underpin the long term future of Interserve,"" Interserve CEO Debbie White said in the statement.
The company, which among other activities cleans rail stations and provides probation services to the Ministry of Justice, said on Saturday that it was looking at bringing new capital into the business and selling non-core businesses.

That followed a report in the Financial Times that the company was in rescue refinancing talks that could see creditors take control.

Citing internal documents from investigators, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that Poetsch, VW's finance head at the time, learned about the carmaker's violations of the rules in late June 2015.
The paper cites a confidential presentation from the VW legal department, available to investigators in proceedings about the carmaker's alleged market manipulation.
According to the report, a presentation dubbed ""Sacramento"" and dated June 24, 2015, stated that U.S. emissions rules were being violated and that the company may also have breached its supervisory obligations. 
The paper also reported that, according to testimony from a leading VW lawyer, referred to as ""witness P."", Poetsch received the presentation on June 29, 2015. He was also informed then that 600,000 vehicles in the U.S. were affected and that the financial risk for VW stood at 35 billion euros ($39.8 billion).
Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday that it had been aware of the allegations for some time.
""The presentation by the witness P. is emphatically rejected as inaccurate.""
The diesel issue was the subject of a number of discussions with Poetsch in the summer of 2015, Volkswagen said. 
""However, none of these discussions had the content and quality which could have made capital markets law relevant for Mr. Poetsch.""
Volkswagen added that until the publication of the Notice of Violation by the U.S. authorities on September 18, 2015 it did not have sufficiently concrete indication of a situation that could be share price sensitive.
Poetsch became VW chairman shortly after the ""Dieselgate"" scandal broke in 2015.
Plaintiffs in a market manipulation lawsuit in Germany say Volkswagen failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has so far cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines.
The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities.

The agreement, which could potentially benefit companies such as smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), relates to investments in the stock connect scheme which links exchanges on the mainland with the Hong Kong bourse.
""The three exchanges will promptly work on formulating relevant rules and will announce them to the market after completing necessary procedures,"" the Hong Kong stock exchange said in a statement.
The new rules were expected to be implemented in the middle of next year, it added.
The stock connect scheme allows Chinese investors their only direct means of trading offshore stocks, and international investors access to China's companies.

The agreement comes five months after the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges caught investors and exchange officials off guard when they said they would not allow mainland investors to buy shares in Hong Kong-listed companies with different voting right structures.

Most companies in Tel Aviv must currently report in Hebrew, with the exception of high-tech and dual-listed firms that are permitted to use English. The new proposal offers the option to all businesses and is meant to bring Tel Aviv in line with leading global exchanges, where English is commonly accepted.
""Giving the option to report in English is expected to remove the language barrier and further open the Israeli market to the world,"" said Anat Guetta, chair of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA).
Israel has been taking steps over the past few years to boost trading volumes in Tel Aviv, reducing regulations and encouraging dual-listings.
The public has until Jan. 16 to respond to the proposal.

If it is accepted and the law is amended, companies making an initial public offering in Tel Aviv could choose English, while those already listed would need board and shareholder approval to switch languages.

Brazilian-born Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since his Nov. 19 arrest on suspicion of conspiring with former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly to understate his compensation by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million), over five years from 2010. 
Tokyo authorities extended their detention until the maximum Dec. 10 for the alleged crime.
A Brazil court has granted Ghosn access to the property, owned by Nissan, in the Copacabana neighborhood, but the company said in a statement on Sunday that it was now petitioning a higher court to reverse the decision.
""Nissan has been cooperating with authorities to investigate misconduct on the part of its former chairman, and is working to prevent the destruction of any potential evidence that could occur by allowing access to residences in question,"" a Nissan spokesman said.
A person close to the Tokyo prosecutors' office told Reuters that Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan itself will be indicted as early as Monday.
""Nissan identified serious misconduct related to the reporting of Mr. Ghosn's compensation. The company has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with its investigation. We will continue to do so,"" the Nissan spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Brazilian builder Odebrecht’s Peruvian unit has signed a deal with Peruvian authorities to pay a multimillion dollar fine that will allow it to continue operating in the country in return for providing evidence about officials it bribed, three sources related to the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
Two sources said the fine would amount to approximately $182 million to be paid over 15 years. It would also admit that it paid bribes to win six contracts related to four infrastructure projects, they added.
The third source said Odebrecht would pay a total of some $200 million and the deal would include reference to a fifth project for which it has already admitted paying bribes. 
Odebrecht has been at the center of Latin America’s largest graft scandal since admitting in a 2016 plea deal with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts, including $30 million in bribes in Peru.
The three sources told Reuters that the plea agreement with the Peruvian authorities was signed in the early hours of Saturday, after 12 hours of final negotiations between representatives of the prosecutor's office, the attorney general's office and Odebrecht in Peru.
The agreement allows Odebrecht to continue operating in Peru in exchange for its executives giving evidence against Peruvian officials and politicians who allegedly received bribes over almost 20 years.
Odebrecht's representatives in Peru declined to comment.
After Brazil, Peru has seen the greatest fallout from the Odebrecht scandal. All four of its most recent former presidents, and its opposition leader, are under investigation in connection with payments from Odebrecht. All deny wrongdoing. [L2N1XB2F7]
In the agreement, Odebrecht accepts it paid bribes in relation to six contracts, two sources said. 
Two involve the construction of a road linking Brazil and Peru during the government of former President Alejandro Toledo, between 2001 and 2006, while two more relate to the construction of Lima's Metro under former President Alan García (2006-2011), they added.
Two more involved the extension of a coastal road in Lima and construction of a highway in the Andean city of Cusco.
A final contract, referenced by the third source and for which it has already admitted paying bribes, relates to a road project in the Ancash region north of Peru. 
""The 15 years' time frame was established for the payments because Odebrecht is technically bankrupt,"" one of the sources said.

Peruvian prosecutors are expected to begin questioning several Odebrecht executives in Brazil in January, including the former head of the firm in Peru, Jorge Barata.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 12:36AM ET</span>",China urges Canada to free Huawei CFO or face consequences,"By Ben Blanchard and David Ljunggren
BEIJING/OTTAWA (Reuters) - China warned Canada on Saturday that there would be severe consequences if it did not immediately release Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, calling the case ""extremely nasty"".
Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's global chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 and faces extradition to the United States, which alleges that she covered up her company's links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions.
The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei.
If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge.
No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the hearing was adjourned until Monday.
In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to lodge a ""strong protest"".
Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond what the Minister said yesterday"".
Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in Beijing has assured Chinese that consular access will be provided to Meng.
When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship with Beijing.
Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach of her lawful rights, Le said.
The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its very nature ""extremely nasty"", he added.
""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful, legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full responsibility for the serious consequences caused.""
The statement did not elaborate.
""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday.
""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that. That's the price of dealing with a country like China.""
On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said that while China would not ""cause trouble"", it also did not fear trouble and that nobody should underestimate China's determination on this case.
""Only if the Canadian side corrects its mistake and immediately stops infringing upon the lawful, legitimate rights of a Chinese citizen and gives a proper accounting to the Chinese people can it avoid paying a heavy price for this,"" it said in an editorial.
Meng's arrest was on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.
""We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,"" said a U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce.

A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."" The company has said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations.

Baer said in October it was closing its branches in Peru and Panama as part of its effort to focus on larger markets in the region such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
A source familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified, said on Saturday that talks with Santander over Baer's Venezuelan book of business were under way but had not yet been concluded.
Last month, another source told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Santander was talking to Julius Baer about taking over some of the Swiss bank's clients in Venezuela.
A third source said a potential deal would not involve the transfer of any portfolio or assets, but rather come as referral agreement where the Spanish bank could access Baer's clients.
A spokesman for the Spanish bank declined to comment.
Switzerland's Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper reported on Saturday that Baer had ended ties in April with hundreds of clients in Venezuela with less than $1.5 million each in assets, and that the remaining clients there had more than $20 million each in assets.
Santander has not operated in Venezuela since agreeing in 2009 to sell its stake in Banco de Venezuela to the country's government for 1.05 billion euros ($1.19 billion).
Baer's possible exit from Venezuela follows legal proceedings involving a former executive in Latin America. The bank itself has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Matthias Krull, a former Julius Baer Panama vice-chairman, was sentenced to 10 years in U.S. prison in October after pleading guilty for his role in a billion-dollar scheme to launder money embezzled from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].

799,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",The 2018 Contrarians Who Got It Right: What They're Saying Now,"(Bloomberg) -- With just three weeks to go, 2018’s market contrarians are proving prescient.
The outlook was decidedly bullish for U.S. stocks and developing-nation assets 12 months ago, with both forecast to build upon a stellar 2017. The beaten-down greenback wasn’t expected to fare any better in 2018, as a rosy international growth outlook threatened to lure investors away from American markets. And despite some tough talk between the U.S. and China, risks of an all-out trade war were an afterthought.
Not much has gone according to plan, but DWS, Cantor Fitzgerald and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were among the few who bet against the trend and got it right. Federal Reserve rate hikes against a backdrop of sharply escalating trade tensions roiled markets in 2018, punishing U.S. stocks and causing risk-averse investors to flee developing nations. Meanwhile, the down-and-out dollar has gained against virtually all major currencies amid rising rates and buoyant U.S. growth.
Here’s what those who called 2018 correctly expect in the new year:
Stalling Dollar
Stefanie Holtze-Jen, chief currency strategist at asset manager DWS, is among the vindicated.
In February, after the dollar’s worst annual slide in 14 years, she called for the greenback to strengthen to $1.15 per euro by March 2019, from the prevailing level of about $1.23. The argument that the U.S.’s twin deficits would depress the dollar was over-hyped, according to Holtze-Jen, who saw extreme bearish positioning setting up a rebound.
The dollar’s rally starting in mid-April proved her right -- inflicting pain on global investors. But Holtze-Jen doesn’t expect another strong year for the greenback. She sees the euro ending next year at $1.15 as slowing growth and European political woes weigh on the common currency, while the Fed approaches the end of its hiking cycle. Expectations for Fed rate increases have crumbled, with markets now pricing in less than a quarter-point of tightening in 2019.
Most forecasters expect the euro-dollar pair to reach $1.20 by the end of 2019, according to a Bloomberg survey, from about $1.14 now.
“The Fed has come back from autopilot,” said Holtze-Jen. “Their calls will be more data-dependent. That’s something that takes the needle lower on the dollar going forward.”
U.S. Equities Gloom
When it comes to U.S. stocks, 2018’s bears are still skeptical. For months, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Peter Cecchini has forecast the S&P 500 to finish the year at 2,805, one of the more bearish projections among Wall Street’s strategists, and almost 7 percent above Friday’s close.
A deceleration in U.S. growth, driven in part by higher funding costs on tighter financial conditions, and a frothy commercial and industrial loan market will create credit stress next year, according to Cecchini.
“Our disposition towards equities has moved from buy-the-dip to sell-the-rally,” said Cecchini, Cantor’s chief global market strategist. “If I’m not constructive on the credit markets, then I won’t be constructive on the equity markets.”
He has company in his pessimism. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, the biggest equity bear on Wall Street, forecast last month that the S&P 500 will end 2019 at 2,750, the same target he called for this year. As the fiscal boost from tax cuts wears off and global growth decelerates, Wilson expects a “material” deceleration in corporate profits.
That’s at odds with what most strategists expect. The average prediction as of the end of November was for the S&P 500 to climb to 3,056 by the end of next year, according to 14 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg. It’s the most optimistic year-ahead call since 2009.
Emerging Cheer
Jordi Visser at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, who predicted the peak of the developing-market rally in late January, expects emerging markets to be a bright spot in 2019 as the dollar stumbles. Visser is calling for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) to outperform the S&P 500 Index by 15 percent to 20 percent in 2019. Chinese Internet stocks, developing-nation sovereign debt and emerging-market currencies look particularly attractive.
""Bullishness comes from an expectation of a weaker dollar next year on the back of easier U.S. monetary policy, the lag of recent Chinese stimulus measures and a focus of value as a factor in 2019 rather than growth,"" said New-York based Visser, chief investment officer at the $1.7 billion hedge fund.
Tania Escobedo, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC who correctly called a slide in the Brazilian real this year when most of the market was bullish, now has another contrarian call for 2019. She’s wagering against the real and going long the Mexican peso. Most investors are optimistic about Brazil’s incoming government and concerned about the populist rhetoric from Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
There are “pockets of value” in emerging markets, including Argentina’s beaten-down currency, Lisa Chua, a New York-based money manager at Man GLG, said in an interview last month. The firm boasted this year’s top developing-nation debt fund with more than $1 billion under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Trade Reminder
A year ago, Jens Nordvig at Exante Data LLC was cautioning that the markets weren’t adequately priced for a building U.S.-China trade dispute, as concern about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program garnered more attention. Now he expects trade tensions will remain a focal point in 2019, even after the world’s two biggest economies appear to have reached a tentative truce on tariffs.
“China will try to delay and delay, but not give in on the big stuff,” said Nordvig, Wall Street’s top-ranked currency strategist for five years running before founding Exante. “By the second quarter, the U.S. will have to decide if they agree to some cosmetic concessions, or whether they are actually ready for a sustained trade war.”

VANCOUVER/LONDON (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer faces U.S. accusations that she covered up her company's links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions, a Canadian prosecutor said on Friday, arguing against giving her bail while she awaits extradition.
After nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, no decision was reached and the hearing was adjourned until Monday 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time (1800 GMT).
The case against Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of Huawei [HWT.UL], stems from a 2013 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131 about the company's close ties to Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran despite U.S. and European Union bans, the prosecutor told a Vancouver court.
U.S. prosecutors argue that Meng was not truthful to banks who asked her about links between the two firms, the court heard on Friday. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, the court heard, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge. 
Meng, 46, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. The arrest was on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.
The news of her arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his top economic advisers have downplayed its importance to trade talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. 
A spokesman for Huawei had no immediate comment on the case against Meng on Friday. The company has said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations.
Friday's court hearing is intended to decide on whether Meng can post bail or if she is a flight risk and should be kept in detention.
The prosecutor opposed bail, arguing that Meng was a high flight risk with few ties to Vancouver and that her family's wealth would mean than even a multi-million-dollar surety would not weigh heavily should she breach conditions.
Meng's lawyer, David Martin, said her prominence made it unlikely she would breach any court orders.
""You can trust her,"" he said. Fleeing ""would humiliate and embarrass her father, whom she loves,"" he argued.
The United States has 60 days to make a formal extradition request, which a Canadian judge will weigh to determine whether the case against Meng is strong enough. Then it is up to Canada's justice minister to decide whether to extradite her. 
Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday that neither Canada nor the United States had provided China any evidence that Meng had broken any law in those two countries, and reiterated Beijing's demand that she be released.
Chinese state media accused the United States of trying to ""stifle"" Huawei and curb its global expansion.
IRAN BUSINESS
The U.S. case against Meng involves Skycom, which had an office in Tehran and which Huawei has described as one of its ""major local partners"" in Iran.
In January 2013, Reuters reported that Skycom, which tried to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator, had much closer ties to Huawei and Meng than previously known.
In 2007, a management company controlled by Huawei's parent company held all of Skycom's shares. At the time, Meng served as the management firm's company secretary. Meng also served on Skycom's board between February 2008 and April 2009, according to Skycom records filed with Hong Kong's Companies Registry.
Huawei used Skycom's Tehran office to provide mobile network equipment to several major telecommunications companies in Iran, people familiar with the company's operations have said. Two of the sources said that technically Skycom was controlled by Iranians to comply with local law but that it effectively was run by Huawei.
Huawei and Skycom were ""the same,"" a former Huawei employee who worked in Iran said on Friday.
A Huawei spokesman told Reuters in 2013: ""Huawei has established a trade compliance system which is in line with industry best practices and our business in Iran is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the U.N. We also require our partners, such as Skycom, to make the same commitments.""
U.S. CASE
The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported in April.
The case against Meng revolves around her response to banks, who asked her about Huawei's links to Skycom in the wake of the 2013 Reuters report. U.S. prosecutors argue that Meng fraudulently said there was no link, the court heard on Friday.
U.S. investigators believe the misrepresentations induced the banks to provide services to Huawei despite the fact they were operating in sanctioned countries, Canadian court documents released on Friday showed.
The hearing did not name any banks, but sources told Reuters this week that the probe centered on whether Huawei had used  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) to conduct illegal transactions. HSBC is not under investigation.
U.S. intelligence agencies have also alleged that Huawei is linked to China's government and its equipment could contain ""backdoors"" for use by government spies. No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims.

The probe of Huawei is similar to one that threatened the survival of China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), which pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran. ZTE paid a $892 million penalty.

802,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Airbus wins December deliveries some breathing room after busy November,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has left itself a slightly less challenging task on deliveries for the final weeks of the year than 2017's record surge in December, but only after trimming the target with its most recent results, company data showed on Friday.
Airbus said it had delivered 673 aircraft up to the end of November, leaving 109 aircraft still to be delivered in December in order to reach a core target of 782 deliveries - excluding the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now selling as the A220.
Airbus in October said it maintained a target of 800 deliveries for 2018, but that these would now include 18 A220 models previously been excluded from the goal - a move equivalent to cutting the core Airbus target by 2 percent to 782 aircraft.
Had it not done so, it would have had to repeat last year's record feat of 127 deliveries in December, after taking into account a 20 percent rise in deliveries last month. 
Airbus recently took formal control of the former Bombardier A220 after buying it to bolster its lineup of larger jets and thwart a possible sale of the project to China, a future aerospace rival.
Still, it has been struggling to keep its own deliveries on track this year due to a combination of engine delays and industrial problems. 
Most industry sources have estimated it will hit the recently softened target, but with a razor-thin margin for error.
November saw an acceleration of deliveries to airlines linked to China's debt-laden HNA Group, including five for Beijing Capital airlines, directly or via leasing firms.
Reuters last month reported Airbus was set to resume stalled deliveries of jets to HNA Group.
November also saw the first delivery of the upgraded A330neo long-range range model to TAP Portugal.
Further A330neo deliveries have been slowed by snags at engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Airbus's incoming chief executive said last month those delays should be re-absorbed by end-2019.
Emirates took two A380 deliveries in November.
On the order front, Airbus sold 40 planes commercially plus three internally for conversion to air tankers.
Its January-November tally of 439 gross orders - or 380 after cancellations - leaves it well behind rival Boeing Co's (N:BA) totals of 821 gross and 642 net orders up to the end of October, the latest period for which figures are available.
Earlier on Friday, leasing firm Avolon firmed up an order for 100 A320-family aircraft that will appear in the year-end order count, due to be released in mid-January.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More losses may be ahead for U.S. stocks in the short term, according to an indicator with a fittingly ominous name: the death cross.
A chart pattern tracked by technical analysts and other market mavens, a death cross forms when an index's near-term moving average of daily closing prices falls below its long-term moving average as both averages are declining. The 50- and 200-day moving averages are commonly used.
On Friday, the S&P 500 Index, the U.S. benchmark for large stocks, joined the main gauge of small companies' share performance, the Russell 2000, in forming a death cross. 
It occurred as the S&P tumbled another 2.3 percent for its third straight daily decline. That pushed its 50-day moving average 3.7 points below its declining 200-day moving average, resulting in the first death cross since January 2016.
The S&P is now down 10.16 percent from its record close on Sept. 20.
Historically, the death cross has indicated a further fall for the index after the pattern emerges.
For instance, a death cross appeared on the Russell 2000 chart on Nov. 14 after it had fallen 13.7 percent from its all-time high closing level reached on Aug. 31. It has dropped another 3.6 percent in the three weeks since.

(Graphic: A 'death cross' forms in U.S. stocks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QhRzTz)
Before Friday, a death cross had appeared on the S&P 500 only 12 times since 1928, according to research from Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group in Harrison, New York. 
Following 10 of those instances, the index has been lower a month later. On average, the S&P 500 had fallen 1.9 percent one month after a death cross formed, with a median one-month decline of 3.1 percent. 
Six months later, however, the index is typically higher, with an average gain of 7.5 percent and a median rise of 9.8 percent.
Like all technical indicators, it has its limits, and not all large market sell-offs are signaled in advance by a death cross. The 2007-2009 bear market brought on by the financial crisis, which saw the S&P lose more than half of its value in 17 months, occurred without a death cross ever having formed.
There have been four S&P death crosses since then, however.
Some market technicians, such as Brian LaRose at ICAP (LON:NXGN) Technical Analysis in Jersey City, New Jersey, see the death cross as more of a lagging indicator than a leading one, simply reflecting an acceleration of losses in a market already in an established decline.
""It doesn't happen until the market has already broken down, and we've already seen that happen,"" said Ken Polcari, managing principal at ButcherJoseph Asset Management in New York. ""We're in for more bumpy price action, but I don't think we're in for a crash.""

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Erases Gains for Year on Tech, Trade Turmoil","Investing.com - The Dow erased its gains for the year after plunging Friday on a weak jobs report and concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.24% and is down 1.34% year-to-date. The S&P 500 fell 2.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.05%.
U.S.-China trade tensions were thrown into further turmoil after President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said if issues with China are not resolved during the 90-day ceasefire, the administration would raise existing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, however, offered a more sanguine outlook, telling CNBC that Trump would consider extending the 90-day tariff truce with China if progress is made in talks.
But Kudlow's remarks did little to allay concerns as investors abandoned trade sensitive corners of the market like industrials.
Indutrial heavyweights Boeing (NYSE:BA), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), all of which have strong international exposure, were under pressure, accelerating downside momentum in the broader market.
Tech also contributed meaningfully to the selloff on Wall Street, led by Apple after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the tech giant's shares on fears over a slowing smartphone market in China.
Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $236 from $253, citing supply-chain conversations in Asia that revealed a weaker backdrop for smartphone demand. That was the third Apple price cut this week following cuts by both Rosenblatt and HSBC, sending Apple's share price more than 3% lower.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also closed lower.
Energy, meanwhile, struggled to take advantage of the rally in oil prices, which had followed an agreement by OPEC and its allies to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day for the first six months of 2019.
Wall Street's start to the session was soured by a U.S. labor market report showing the economy created fewer jobs than expected and wage growth fell short of forecasts.
Analysts at CIBC, however, said the report was ""constructive,"" paving the way for a December rate hike, adding that the drop in job gains was unsurprising as the economy is nearing full employment.
On the corporate news front, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) slumped 13% as underwhelming guidance and concerns over margin pressures offset above-forecast earnings.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell more than 2 percent on Friday in a broad sell-off led by declines in big Internet and technology shares, and posted their largest weekly percentage drops since March as concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions and interest rates convulsed Wall Street.
The S&P 500 erased virtually all of its gains from a week earlier, when the benchmark index notched its biggest weekly rise in seven years.
Following a weekend truce between Washington and Beijing in talks in Argentina, stocks have been volatile all week as investors comb through the news looking for signs of whether a trade-tension cloud over the stock market would dissipate.
Concerns over U.S.-China trade relations were fanned by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's comments that U.S. officials would raise tariff rates if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period.
Along with trade, Wall Street has been focused on bond yields and the direction of interest rate policy from the Federal Reserve, with some investors expecting a slower pace of hikes than previously anticipated.
""It’s a crisis of confidence on the trade situation, what’s going to happen there, and maybe a little bit of a crisis of confidence in the Fed, given how quickly they have got to change their tune,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 558.72 points, or 2.24 percent, to 24,388.95, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 62.87 points, or 2.33 percent, to 2,633.08 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 219.01 points, or 3.05 percent, to 6,969.25.
Technology shares tumbled, with the S&P 500 tech sector down 3.5 percent. Healthcare shares (SPXHC), the biggest gainer among major S&P sectors this year, dropped 2.5 percent.
The S&P 500's 50-day moving average fell below its 200-day moving average, a phenomenon known as a ""death cross"" and one that some market watchers see as a bearish near-term signal.
(Graphic: Hundreds of U.S. stocks are marking year lows - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RHJX9R)
For the week, the Dow fell 4.5 percent, the S&P 500 slid 4.6 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 4.9 percent.
The Dow Jones Transport Average (DJT) tumbled 8 percent for the week, its biggest weekly drop in more than seven years. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 5.6 percent, its biggest weekly drop since January 2016.
Government data showed U.S. job growth slowed in November and wages increased less than forecast, suggesting some moderation in economic activity that could support expectations of fewer interest rate increases from the Fed in 2019. The Fed is due to meet Dec. 18-19.
""People were expecting a stronger labor market report,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. ""It was a little bit weaker on the margin but nonetheless it's going to give the Fed some food for thought as they ... debate how they're going to shape policy for the upcoming year.""
Energy shares (SPNY) fell 0.6 percent, supported by rising oil prices as Saudi Arabia and other producers in OPEC, as well as allies like Russia, agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market.
In a closely watched initial public offering, shares of biotech company  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) fell 19.1 percent in their debut.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 238 new lows. 
On Thursday, 1,322 stocks made new 52-week lows on the Nasdaq and NYSE on Thursday, the most since January 2016.

About 8.7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 03:16PM ET</span>",Huawei arrest stokes fears of China reprisals among America Inc executives,"By Fanny Potkin and Adam Jourdan
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - At a closed-door security meeting of U.S. companies in Singapore on Thursday, one topic was high on the agenda: the arrest of a top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei [HWT.UL] and the potential backlash on American firms operating in China.
Officials from major U.S. companies who attended the event, a scheduled meeting of the local chapter of the U.S. Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), voiced concerns about retaliation against American firms and their executives, two people with knowledge of the meeting said.
A number of attendees said their companies were considering restricting non-essential China travel and looking to move meetings outside the country, one of the people added. 
Security executives for companies including Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) attended the meeting, according to the sources and a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) posting by one of the attendees.
The companies all declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The discussions at the meeting underscore concerns rippling through U.S. businesses in the world's second largest economy, already facing a delicate balancing act amid a tense trade standoff between Washington and Beijing.
The formal agenda for the meeting, held at Google's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, included presentations on economic crime and terrorism in the region. OSAC promotes ""security cooperation between American private sector interests worldwide and the U.S. Department of State,"" according to its website.
But conversation soon turned to possible risks in China prompted by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and ""heiress"" of Chinese telecom network equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, who was detained in Canada on Dec. 1. The news of the arrest was made public on Wednesday.
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was held at Washington's request as part of a U.S. investigation of an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, people familiar with the probe said.
The arrest has roiled global markets amid fears that it could further inflame the Sino-U.S. trade row.
Risk consultants and analysts said that the arrest could prompt Beijing to retaliate in some form. 
""This will pressure a lot of Chinese officials to look strong in this dispute,"" said Nick Marro, Hong Kong-based Asia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, who added that technology companies were particularly at risk.
""This could mean either taking a stronger stance on trade negotiations, or taking a stronger stance on U.S. tech firms in China right now.""
Asked whether there would be any retaliation against any foreign executives in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday China has always protected the lawful rights of foreigners in China in accordance with the law. 
""Of course in China they should respect China's laws and rules.""
EARLY CHRISTMAS TRIP?
OSAC says it is made up of 34 private and public sector member organizations. It lists its events on its website, including the Dec. 6 meeting in Singapore. There was also a separate listed meeting held in Shanghai on the same day.
Prashant Nayak, Disney's Asia Pacific director of corporate security, posted about the Singapore meeting on LinkedIn, tagging other executives at Google, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Marriot International Inc (O:MAR),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and others. Nayak did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking further comment.
The second person with knowledge of the event said the Huawei arrest and potential fallout was a hot topic at the meeting.
A senior diplomat from the U.S. embassy in Singapore gave opening remarks, but an embassy spokesperson said she left before any discussion.
Asia-based risk consultants said they had seen a rise in the number of clients asking about the Huawei issue and potential concerns related to the impact on U.S. firms in China.
Jakob Korslund, CEO of Singapore-based consultancy Deutsche Risk, said his firm had received a number of enquiries in the last two days asking about the risks of traveling to China.
""For a few we have advised postponing trips that were not time critical, telling clients to wait for the next few weeks to see the situation,"" he said.
James McGregor, chairman of APCO Worldwide's Greater China region, said companies would likely err on the side of not sending executives to China for the time being.
""It's all about avoiding risk, because what do you do if somebody is arrested?"" he told Reuters, adding anxiety was also spreading among executives already in China.

""People are joking about it a little bit and saying 'maybe I should take an early Christmas trip home'.""

834,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 02:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Activist investor Elliott has stake in Germany's Bayer - sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Greg Roumeliotis
FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott has taken a position in Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn), adding to the slew of investments the fund has made in German companies, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Elliott has held shares in Bayer for more than a year, two of the sources said, declining to specify the size of the stake. A holding of more than 3 percent would trigger mandatory disclosure under German securities trading rules. 
While Elliott has tried to talk to Bayer's top management it has not been able to get a meeting with Chief Executive Werner Baumann or his colleagues, one of the sources said, adding that Baumann also declined to talk to other hedge funds invested in the company.
News of the Elliott stake comes in the aftermath of Bayer's $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). The German company faces thousands of lawsuits over a suspected cancer link to the U.S. company's Roundup weedkiller. 
Elliott, founded and run by Paul Singer, declined to comment, as did Bayer. 
Elliott also owns stakes in steelmaker ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG), utility Uniper (DE:UN01) and food processing machinery maker GEA Group (DE:G1AG). 
The presence of such activists on shareholder registers can raise pressure on company management to change strategy and improve shareholder returns. In the case of Thyssenkrupp for instance, where Swedish investor Cevian holds a larger stake, a new CEO was appointed who announced the company would be broken up into two parts.
Bayer shares, which had been down 0.8 percent before the news, closed 1.7 percent higher in Frankfurt.
But the stock has lost 38 percent so far this year, mainly due to risks relating to the more than 9,000 lawsuits brought over Roundup.
Investors have also urged Bayer to strengthen its drug development pipeline, even though its financial firepower was depleted by the Monsanto deal.
Chief Executive Werner Baumann last week unveiled plans to sell businesses, including the animal health operations and two consumer healthcare brands, and cut around 12,000 jobs, vowing to revive earnings growth.
PLANNED AUCTION 
Bayer will kick off the planned auction of consumer brands Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone early next year, people close to the matter said.
The auction of footcare brand Dr. Scholl's, on which Bayer is working with investment banking boutique Sawaya, is expected to start at the end of January, they said.
The Coppertone sale, led by Citi (N:C), is likely to start towards the end of the first quarter, one of the people said.
The two brands could fetch a combined 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), analysts have estimated.
Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) are likely to be among potential suitors for the consumer brands, for which they vied with Bayer when the German company bought them with other assets from Merck & Co (N:MRK) in 2014, people close to the matter have said.
Bayer is also selling its animal health division and Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) are working on the sale, people close to the matter said.
The animal health business, which could fetch between 6 and 7 billion euros, has whetted the appetite of several private equity groups. 
Bayer's rivals in veterinary medicine may face antitrust issues if they tried to buy the whole business. But some of them are expected to express interest either in the part of the business which makes drugs for livestock or the part that focuses on companion animals.
Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis (N:ZTS), the former  Pfizer  (N:PFE) unit, Elanco (N:ELAN), formerly of Eli Lilly (N:LLY), unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY), and drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK).
Bayer's animal health business, the largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs, needs to grow to compete with larger rivals but Bayer lacks the financial firepower to sponsor big moves, sources have said.
Bayer and the banks declined to comment, except for Sawaya which was not immediately available to comment.

Bayer earlier this week reduced its combined sales estimate for its most promising experimental drugs, acknowledging it needs to do more to replenish the development pipeline.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>",Danske Bank elects top shareholder's candidate as chairman,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank elected the favored candidate of its top shareholder as its new chairman on Friday to help steer the Danish lender through a multi-billion euro money laundering scandal.
Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States are investigating payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) made through Danske Bank's tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The threat of a heavy fine from the U.S. Department of Justice has sent Danske's shares down almost 50 percent since March, erasing around $15 billion of market value and raising the prospect of legal action from investors.
The Maersk shipping tycoon family, the bank's top shareholder with a 21 percent stake, ousted chairman Ole Andersen and called Friday's shareholder meeting to nominate Karsten Dybvad, 62 and another board member.
There were more than 600 shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in Copenhagen on Friday which elected Dybvad to the board. The modified board of directors then elected Dybvad as the new chairman.
Outgoing chairman Andersen and other managers were criticized by several private shareholders at the meeting.
""I take my responsibility. Let's just call it a firing, and I agree that a firing is the right thing,"" Andersen said about his own departure from the bank.
Dybvad was CEO of the Confederation of Danish Industry, one of the country's most influential lobby groups, for the last eight years and before that had a long career as a government official working with ministers from both left and right of Danish politics, though his role did not involve oversight of banks.
""We hope and are confident that Karsten can contribute to the dialogue with authorities which probably will take up a lot of time the next couple of years,"" said Robert Maersk Uggla, A.P. Moller Holding chief executive at the meeting.
Besides restoring Danske's image, Dybvad is also tasked with finding a new chief executive to head the bank and ensure potential legal cases, not least in the United States, don't drag attention away from day-to-day business.
""There is great task in handling the ongoing investigations in relation to the Estonia case in a way that can contribute to re-establishing confidence in Danske Bank,"" said Claus Wiinblad, senior vice president at Denmark's largest investor, pension fund ATP. 
Jesper Nielsen has taken on the CEO role on an interim basis since Thomas Borgen resigned in September.
The Maersk family's investment firm A.P. Moller Holding, is usually a passive shareholder. The family controls shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb).
""We make this move because we think that Danske's board has not reacted swiftly enough to find a replacement for the current chairman,"" said Robert Maersk Uggla, A.P. Moller Holding chief executive.
The move was welcomed by others at the meeting.
""We see this demonstration of active ownership as positive,"" said Mikael Bak, chief executive at Danish Shareholders' Association, a lobby group for private investors.
""We would have liked to see the large shareholders a little earlier, perhaps far earlier,"" Bak added.
One private shareholder proposed from the rostrum that the remaining board members also step down.

843,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 01:08PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: Bears Bite on Apple as Morgan Stanley Cuts Price Target,"Investing.com - Apple led tech lower Friday after Morgan Stanley jumped on the bandwagon of Apple price cuts on fears over a slowing smartphone market in China.
Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $236 from $253, citing supply-chain conversations in Asia that revealed a weaker backdrop for smartphone demand. That was the third Apple price cut this week following cuts by both Rosenblatt and HSBC, sending Apple's share price more than 2% lower.
Rising average selling prices and better smartphone quality are leading people to keep their current devices for longer, lengthening replacement cycles, which hurt smartphone makers like Apple, Morgan Stanley said.
The Wall Street bank did, however, provide a semblance of optimism as it said wearables and services revenues could help limit the damage somewhat from the weaker iPhone demand.
In a further sign that Apple's newest batch of iPhones are not selling as well as many had hoped, Broadcom's CEO Hock Tan said strong performance in the company's wireless divisions was driven by demand for older smartphones from a North American customer.
While Tan didn’t mention Apple by name, the iPhone maker is Broadcom’s largest North American partner, suggesting Apple has seen strong sales of older iPhone models, according to Bloomberg.
Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported above-forecast fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, but it struggled to hold gains amid a marketwide rout. Its share rose 0.95% to $229.40, down from a session high of $238.28."

855,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",Medicare Advantage plans get unfair push from U.S. government: critics,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Insurance companies do not need any help marketing Medicare Advantage plans - just ask anyone over age 65 about the pitches that clog their mailboxes every year during the fall enrollment period, or check out the television ads that flood cable channels.
So why is the federal government giving these private all-in-one plans an extra marketing push? That is the question raised by two consumer advocacy groups, who charge that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is improperly urging enrollees to pick Advantage plans in ways that tip the scales against traditional fee-for-service Medicare. 
Medicare Advantage plans roll together coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services and prescription drugs that are provided through separate parts of traditional Medicare. In 
a letter sent last month to CMS Administrator Seema Verma, the Medicare Rights Center and the Center for Medicare Advocacy criticize a suite of online tools on the Medicare website that aim to help consumers decide between Advantage and traditional Medicare. The tools make ""overly-broad suggestions"" that encourage Advantage enrollment when ""more nuance is required, and by failing to present individuals with the full array of Medicare coverage options,"" the letter states.
The consumer groups also say that a CMS email campaign during fall enrollment (which ends on Dec. 7) is improperly biased toward Advantage plans. The campaign includes messages with subject lines such as ""Could Medicare Advantage be right for you?"" and ""Get more benefits for your money,"" and contain messages such as ""check out Medicare Advantage.""
CMS did not respond to requests for comment on perceptions that its Advantage promotions lack balance, or who it regards as the target audience.
This is not the first time CMS has been accused of bias in favor of Advantage. Earlier this year, advocacy groups called foul over language contained in a draft of the 2019 Medicare handbook that CMS sends to enrollees every year. (https://reut.rs/2J6D9l1) CMS later responded by fixing the language in the final draft of its handbook ""Medicare & You.""
Advantage plans differ from traditional fee-for-service Medicare in several ways. They receive capped per-enrollee payments from the federal government, rather than the fee-for service model used in the traditional program. Advantage plans must cap enrollees' out-of-pocket expenses; and most wrap in prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries typically must use a network of providers, while enrollees in traditional Medicare can see any healthcare provider that accepts Medicare - and most do.
Advantage plans often save money for enrollees on premiums, since most pay no additional fee for prescription drug coverage and do not need Medigap supplemental policies, which cap out-of-pocket costs.
And the business is doing just fine without cheerleading by CMS. Enrollment has more than tripled since 2005 to 20 million beneficiaries, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Congressional Budget Office projects enrollment will rise from 34 percent to 42 percent of the Medicare population by 2028. 
The companies running plans are enjoying a boom in revenue - for example, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the nation's largest seller of Medicare Advantage plans, reported a 15.2 percent revenue jump in its Medicare business during the third quarter compared with the year-earlier period, to $18.8 billion.
LOUDER CHEERLEADING 
The Trump administration is not the first to play the role of Advantage booster. “The past few administrations have been very much in favor of private plans,” said Gretchen Jacobson, associate director with the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy. She notes that the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, as well as Congress, have encouraged growth of the program through rulemaking and legislation that made it possible for Advantage plans to add benefits such as vision care and gym memberships, and to cap patient out-of-pocket costs. At the same time, regulators have given Advantage plans greater latitude to set their own rules for certain types of coverage.
But the current round of government support for Advantage plans is louder than anything seen in earlier administrations, said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center. “I’ve been involved in Medicare since 1994, and I can’t remember this kind of government promotion for a particular part of the program,” he said. 
Baker adds that his group has no problem with CMS providing education to consumers - but only if it is balanced. “People have two options, and CMS should be communicating about the advantages and disadvantages of both - this approach is lopsided.”
The motivations are not clear, Jacobson said. A research paper she co-authored recently in the New England Journal of Medicine (https:// concludes that evidence is mixed as to whether Advantage saves the government money or is actually increasing government spending. 
The jury also is out on the quality of care provided by Advantage plans, Jacobson’s study found, especially for people with serious chronic conditions. These patients are disenrolling from Advantage plans at high rates, according to numerous rigorous research studies. “That is a real concern as Advantage enrollment grows,” she said.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",Investors flee bonds and stocks in turbulent week for growth and trade,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pulled billions from bonds and stocks this week as U.S. bond movements triggered fears over global growth and a trade tussle between the United States and China heated up, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday. 
This week's selloff was precipitated by the inversion of part of the U.S. yield curve, which has previously been a reliable indicator of an impending recession.
It deepened on Thursday after the chief financial officer of China's Huawei was arrested on a U.S. request, sending markets spiraling further as investors predicted a worsening of relations between the world's two biggest economies. 
The anxiety drove investors to pull $5.2 billion from equity funds and $8.1 billion from bond funds, according to EPFR data cited by BAML.
""Markets starting to price in recession, but policymakers yet to price in recession,"" argued the BAML strategists.
Equity outflows were made up of opposite flows in ETFs and mutual funds, with $5.3 billion driven into ETFs while $10.5 billion was taken out of mutual funds.
But investors were continuing to edge back into emerging market stocks, which saw their eighth week of inflows with $2.7 billion. 
This helped push BAML's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator of market sentiment up from 2.4 to 2.7 - ""not yet an extreme bearish reading"", BAML strategists said. 
The starting point for a fall to lower equity allocations is high, they pointed out, with the world's largest sovereign wealth fund at 67 percent equity allocations.
Hedge funds are still at a net 35 to 40 percent net long, and BAML's fund manager survey shows cash levels under 5 percent.
The global consensus forecast is for 8.3 percent growth in earnings-per-share in 2019, which the strategists said was too high, predicting a ""Big Low"" in markets next year.
In bond flows investors were pulling out of corporate debt and into government debt, the EPFR data showed. 
Some $15 billion flowed into government bond funds over the past eight weeks, while $49 billion flowed out of investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt.
In equity sectors, a building preference for value stocks over growth inverted this week, as tech had its biggest inflows in 11 weeks and financials saw heavy outflows.

Healthcare, tech, energy, and real estate saw inflows while consumer stocks, utilities, and materials saw outflows. Financials were the least preferred with investors pulling $1.3 billion from the sector.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>",Brazil's government joins Embraer in challenging injunction of tie-up with Boeing,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's government said on Friday that it would appeal an injunction issued Thursday blocking a proposed tie-up between planemakers Embraer and Boeing (NYSE:BA) , joining Embraer, which has also said it will challenge the decision. 
The Brazilian government will appeal through its solicitor general. 
Embraer announced in July its intention to sell 80 percent of its commercial aviation business to Boeing for $3.8 billion. Embraer has said the deal is crucial for its survival. 
Meanwhile, Boeing's takeover is widely seen as a response to a similar deal earlier this year, in which Airbus took a controlling stake in the commercial segment of Canada's Bombardier Inc , which used to directly compete with Embraer. 
The Embraer deal has stalled since July partly because the Brazilian government, which has veto power over any significant business decisions, has been reluctant to approve it.

Embraer needs government approval, a remnant of when the company was state-owned before its privatization in the 1990s, before it can formally present the deal with Boeing to its shareholders.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 09:54AM ET</span>",Altria bets big on cannabis with $1.8 billion investment in Canada's Cronos,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc made a big bet on the rapidly growing marijuana industry on Friday with a $1.8 billion investment in Canadian cannabis producer Cronos Group Inc.
The deal gives Altria an up to 55 percent stake in Cronos and is the latest in a string of investments from consumer companies hoping to benefit from Canada's move to legalize marijuana for recreational use.
Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) announced a $4 billion investment in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth in August, the biggest investment so far in the industry.
With the Cronos deal, Altria will get a new opportunity to boost revenue as cigarette smoking continues to decline in the United States.
Federal data from November showed cigarette smoking among U.S. adults reached an estimated 14 percent in 2017, the lowest level ever.
Altria is also in talks to take a minority stake of between 20 percent and 40 percent in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc, sources told Reuters last month.
""Altria's experience is very wide-ranging - not just in tobacco, but in adult beverages in different categories and decades of experience in how to bring different products to market,"" Cronos Chief Executive Officer Michael Gorenstein said on call with analysts.
""That experience, we think, is going to be very important as we try to accelerate new product categories.""
As part of the deal, Altria will buy 146.2 million of newly issued Cronos shares at C$16.25 per share for a 45 percent stake. The offer represents a 16.2 percent premium to the stock's Thursday close on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Shares of Altria were up 1.6 percent at $55.29 in early trading, while U.S.-listed shares of Cronos were up about 29 percent at $13.49.
The deal also includes warrants to acquire additional ownership interest in Cronos at a price of C$19 per share over the next four years, which could raise Altria's stake to 55 percent.
After the deal is closed, Altria will have the right to nominate four directors, including one independent, to the Cronos board.
Cronos announced earlier this week that Altria could make a possible investment after Reuters reported the tobacco giant was in talks to acquire Cronos.
Altria's ability to handle regulatory pressures could help the company navigate complex legal issues such as product registration and taxation as more cannabis markets open up around the world, Cronos said.

Separately Altria also said it would discontinue some of its e-cigarette brands, including all of MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vaper products, based on their financial performance and will take a related pretax charge of $200 million in the fourth quarter.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 09:53AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon targets airports for checkout-free store expansion,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is looking at bringing its futuristic checkout-free store format to airports in an effort to win business from hungry, time-pressed travelers, according to public records and a person familiar with the strategy.
The move underscores how a company that started as an online bookseller is making forays into brick-and-mortar retail to capture a greater share of shoppers' spending.
For months, the world's largest online retailer has been expanding Amazon Go, where customers scan their smartphones at a turnstile to enter, and then cameras identify what they take from the shelves. When shoppers are finished, they simply leave the store and Amazon bills their credit cards on file.
Amazon has opened seven of the stores to the public since January: in Chicago, San Francisco and its hometown Seattle, mostly catering to workers in nearby offices looking for a quick lunch.
Amazon is evaluating top U.S. airports for new locations, according to public records requests to several airport operators.
""The lead for Amazon Go requested a meeting,"" read a June 27 email from a technology adviser who supports Los Angeles International, the second-busiest airport in the country, to a concessions official. ""Interested?""
""Yes. Thanks!"" the concessions official replied.
A few hundred miles north, in the heart of Silicon Valley, an account manager at Amazon's cloud unit asked San Jose International Airport for a meeting and referenced Amazon Go, as ""one of many possibilities we can discuss.""
After the June meeting took place, during which Amazon discussed how the stores work, an airport information technology manager wrote: ""I am looking forward to moving forward with the Amazon Go technology at the airport.""
Officials from both airports have since told Reuters they had no further correspondence about Amazon Go and that the retailer would have to undergo a competitive bid process to become a concessionaire, as is typical. The company's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, has been in touch with airports for other purposes. The status of the Amazon Go effort is unclear.
An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.
A person familiar with the strategy confirmed that Amazon is studying how to get the checkout-free stores into airports and that an employee with experience in business development was assigned to the task.
""Think about how you can expose your brand,"" the person familiar with the matter said, on condition of anonymity. ""You'll be able to build broad awareness just being in a dozen of the best airports.""
More than 350 million passengers boarded flights at the country's top 12 airports last year, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.
Operating in airports will present new challenges for Amazon Go.
Workers must gain clearances to staff concessions after security checkpoints, and square footage in busy sections of an airport can be expensive to lease. What is more, many airports are publicly run and require would-be concessionaires to put in public bids for retail space.
If ""you do a deal, it's almost like they go back out and shop it,"" said Kazuko Morgan, vice chairman at real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield. She was not speaking with reference to Amazon. 
""Not only do your terms become public knowledge, someone can come in at the last hour and block you,"" she said.
That has not stopped airports from trying to court the online retailer. In September, a concessions manager for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport emailed the vice president in charge of Amazon Go, asking for a partnership ""on the first Airport Amazon Go location.""

The airport did not immediately comment on whether the concessions manager got a response.

A lower-than-expected jobs report raised some concerns about the economy, but also took the pressure off the Federal Reserve to increase rates at a higher pace in 2019.
The S&P 500 fell 4 points, or 0.16%, as of 9:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), while the Dow decreased 59 points, or 0.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 22 points, or 0.31%.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 155,000 in November, which was lower than expected but still consistent with a strengthening job market. The data puts less pressure on the Fed to raise rates.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the Fed is likely to consider a wait-and-see approach after hiking rates at its next meeting in December and does not know when its next rate hike will be.
Chances of a rate hike in December were priced in at 77.5%, according Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Cronos Group was among the top gainers after the opening bell, jumping 26% after Altria (NYSE:MO) announced it was investing $1.8 billion in the medical marijuana company for 45% ownership, with the potential to increase its stake to 55% over the next four years.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 08:25AM ET</span>",Bayer's German workers mostly spared from Monsanto-related job cuts: labor boss,"By Patricia Weiss
Leverkusen (Germany) (Reuters) - The lion's share of job cuts from folding U.S. seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) into Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) agriculture unit will affect workers outside Germany, the head of Bayer's works council told Reuters.
""It's wrong to say that the employees now have to carry the can,"" Oliver Zuehlke, who represents Bayer's German workers, told Reuters. 
Chief Executive Werner Baumann, under pressure to boost Bayer's share price after a drop of more than 35 percent so far this year, last week announced asset sales and the reduction of 12,000 jobs across the diversified group, about 10 percent of the total headcount.
Bayer said at the time this included around 4,100 positions to be slashed due to the integration of Monsanto into Bayer's Crop Science business. 
""By far the largest part of those will be abroad,"" works council head Zuehlke said. He is also Vice Chairman of the supervisory board, as is the norm for listed German companies.
He would not specify in which countries. A Bayer spokesman declined to comment.
In January last year, a spokesman for Donald Trump, then U.S. president-elect, said that Bayer had promised to maintain Monsanto's more than 9,000 U.S. jobs and add 3,000 new U.S. high-tech positions. The deal was agreed at the time but not yet cleared by regulators.
The prospective merger parties said at the time the combined agriculture business planned to spend $16 billion on research and development over the next six years, at least half of which in the United States, creating several thousand new well-paying jobs after integration is completed.
Monsanto had about 20,500 global staff last year. Bayer's Crop Science division has about 16,200 staff, excluding Monsanto and also excluding 4,500 staff at businesses sold to BASF (DE:BASFn) to address antitrust concerns. 
Bayer has said that a significant number of the group-wide job cuts, though not the majority, would affect German sites.
Organized labor at Bayer had backed the restructuring program, mainly because the employer had ruled out forced redundancies in Germany through 2025. 

Bayer expects more than 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in one-off costs from the global cost cuts, mainly for severance packages.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 08:24AM ET</span>",Sleeping bags and mini golf as traders brace for Brexit all-nighter,"By Lawrence White and Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - As lawmakers gather in Britain's parliament on Tuesday to vote on the future of the country's relationship with Europe, traders in London's financial hub will be bracing for a potential burst of market turmoil that could affect the Brexit process itself.
Sterling plunged more than 10 percent in the immediate aftermath of Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, while $2 trillion was wiped off global stock markets. 
This time, traders expect a more muted response. Prime Minister Theresa May is widely expected to fail in her attempt to win support for her Brexit plan, meaning the immediate market reaction could be limited - unless there is a surprise. 
But as her failure would usher in yet more uncertainty over the Brexit process, big market swings may follow - and some commentators have suggested heavy market losses could even convince lawmakers to back May if she tried for a second vote. 
""On the morning after the 2016 referendum result the London Stock Exchange kind of broke because there were such wide spreads on stocks, market makers weren't finding prices,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Britain's biggest direct investment service  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""We are less likely to see turmoil like that as people are ready for a range of outcomes this time, but we could see some big swings,"" he said.
Either way, banks and brokerages will be prepared. 
 Barclays  (L:BARC), Investec (J:INLJ), JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Nomura (T:8604) are among banks in London planning to draft in traders and analysts outside of normal business hours on Tuesday, sources familiar with the matter said, as they prepare for an influx of calls from investors keen to understand or make bets on the implications of the vote.
With the result not expected to become clear until around 1900 GMT, London's stock exchange will be closed, meaning it will be sterling - traded 24 hours a day around the world - that will react first.
""We’re preparing for the big day and night by bringing sleeping bags into the office and have mini golf and pinball in our break out area, so we can keep the traders busy during any quieter hours,"" said Samuel Leach, CEO of Samuel & Co. Trading.
Nomura has booked hotel rooms in the city, a bank spokesman said, for bleary-eyed traders to use if necessary after a night that could set the future for the 2.8 trillion pound ($3.6 trillion) British economy for generations.
""We are going to be glued to our trading screens or television wherever we are,"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund foreign exchange sales at Mizuho (T:8411), another Japanese bank, in London.
WORLD WATCHING
It is not just in London where traders will be gripped by the Brexit vote, with less than four months to go before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29.
In foreign exchange hubs like New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo, traders will watch for signs of May's deal being voted through - seen as indicating an orderly Brexit and therefore positive for sterling - or rejected, signaling more uncertainty.
""If we see it becomes a true volatility event, then the ability to step away from the desk will be challenged. Of course, arrangements will be made to feed the troops and no doubt there will be a few ales after to unwind,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at currency broker Pepperstone in Melbourne.
Traders will be focused on helping investor and corporate clients with what each development in the vote means for them.
""This is an exciting market event and it’s intriguing to see what will happen, but it’s important to remember for our clients that it’s the opposite of that – some of the scenarios could be very painful for businesses,” said Jonathan Pryor, head of foreign exchange sales at Investec in London.
May's compromise Brexit deal has dismayed both supporters of a more decisive break with the EU and those who want ties to remain as close as possible. Her reliance for a majority in parliament on a Northern Irish party that opposes the deal has made her position even more precarious. 
Should she defy the odds, analysts say shares in sectors most directly exposed to the British economy such as banks, insurers, homebuilders and retailers could surge.
Such an outcome could also boost sterling, which could hurt FTSE-100 (FTSE) companies that primarily earn revenues in dollars, such as HSBC (L:HSBA) and  BP  (L:BP).
If May fails, however, it could send shockwaves through a financial industry that has been hoping Britain would move into a transitional deal with the EU until the end of 2020. 
""This vote is a lightning-rod realization for some clients, that two years of ministerial resignations, chit-chat and speculation comes down to this: in three months we could be crashing out of Europe,"" said Matthew Hudson, CEO of MJ Hudson which advises more than 600 institutional and retail investment firms.
Defeat for May could see asset managers immediately move to open offices in Europe to ensure continued access to EU markets in the absence of a deal with the bloc, Hudson said.

""I've got clients who are ready to push the button the minute she loses,"" he said.

884,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Licking their wounds, fund managers prep for rally in '19","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With bond and equity markets from the United States to emerging markets all on pace to lose money this year, investors have not seen this much red on their screens since 1972, the last time no asset class returned at least 5 percent. 
Yet fund managers are finding things to like despite the recent market volatility, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 2 percent this week. 
As they start to position their portfolios for 2019, fund managers, from firms including ValueWorks, Sierra Investment Management and Federated Investors, say they are looking at sectors that could snap back next year thanks to a combination of more attractive valuations and a decline in the dollar.
Such a rally in both fixed income and equities markets would not be unprecedented. A 20 percent decline in the value of the dollar pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 38 percent in 1995, while the U.S. bond market returned nearly 17 percent the same year following one of the worst fixed-income bear markets in memory. 
""If you look out at the broader picture, a lot of things are going right,"" said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management, citing strong consumer confidence and other economic indicators. ""It's easy to make a bull case because the economy is humming along just fine, but the market is nervous because the headlines are really loud and no one likes the unknown,"" she said. 
Part of the yield curve inverted this week when yields on 5- year Treasuries dropped below those on both the 2- and 3-year securities, a signal that has preceded every U.S. recession in recent memory by between 15 months and 2 years. Yet the long delay between a yield curve inversion and a full recession can still be a profitable time to invest, said Charles Lemonides, founder of New York-based hedge fund ValueWorks. 
""I don't buy the thesis that the economy is slowing, but I do believe we are late in the cycle. We're going into a period where investors are getting a little fooled by the headlines and avoiding names that have excitement,"" he said. 
As a result, Lemonides has increased his long exposure to companies that have sold off, including battered semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc (O:MU), whose shares are down 37 percent over the last six months, and iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL), whose shares are down nearly 23 percent over the last 3 months. At the same time, Lemonides has increased his short position on defensive stocks like consumer staples companies  Clorox Co  (N:CLX) and Church & Dwight Co Inc (N:CHD), which have benefited from the market volatility. 
Chad Oviatt, director of investment management at Huntington National Bank, said his firm has been increasing its allocation to U.S. large-cap stocks in anticipation that declining bond buying by the European Central Bank and a resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions will derail the rally in the dollar this year. That should improve margins for U.S. exporters. 
A Reuters poll of 60 currency analysts that ended Dec. 5 forecast that the dollar will be weaker against major currencies next year, with most of the declines coming in the second half of 2019. 
Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager of several value-oriented funds at Federated, said the recent stock market volatility has made stocks, including Apple, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) more attractive at a time when the U.S. economy continues to look stronger than either Europe's or China's. Low oil prices, continued job growth and strong consumer spending will likely prolong the U.S. economic expansion well past next year, she said. 

""If the markets were to close for the year today, people would go into 2019 thinking that there are more opportunities given the valuations,"" she said.

KIEV (Reuters) - The Ukrainian subsidiaries of the Russian banks Sberbank and VEB - under sanction, unable to take on new business and legally barred from transferring assets out of Ukraine -- appear to be winding down their operations, the head of Ukraine's central bank said.
Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian banks amid fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. In September, a Ukrainian court froze the subsidiaries' assets and shares, after Ukrainian companies won a claim for compensation for assets lost from the annexation.
""Russian banks are under sanctions,"" Yakiv Smoliy told Reuters in an interview. ""There is a ban for them on transferring assets outside Ukraine to the parent structures.""
 Asked if the banks were moving towards ending their operations in Ukraine, Smoliy said, ""I guess, yes,"" but added that he was not ready to predict when that would happen.
""Taking into account the structures of the balance sheets and their dynamics in the last two years, they have significantly reduced their presence in the market, significantly reduced their assets, and this indicates that the banks are winding down their business,"" he said.
Sberbank (MM:SBER) said in a statement its assets with high liquidity grew by 50 percent to $330 million in the first nine months of 2018. Sberbank has tried to sell its Ukrainian assets, but the central bank blocked the sale because the bids did not comply with Ukrainian law.
""It should be noted that the bank has always faithfully fulfilled and will continue to faithfully fulfill its obligations to customers,"" Sberbank said.
VEB did not respond to a request for comment. But in a statement on Friday, its subsidiary noted that a court of appeal in Kiev had overturned the September freeze on its assets.
Last month, the Ukrainian central bank declared the subsidiary of Russia's VTB (MM:VTBR) bank insolvent and put it under the control of a state guarantee fund, where its depositors, protected by law, would be paid out.
""The further sale of assets will happen, licenses revoked and - yes – the liquidation of the bank,"" Smoliy said.
All three banks, before 2014, were among the top 15 biggest lenders in Ukraine.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group (SI:NOBG) said on Friday it will seek changes to its original debt restructuring plan, with the spotlight now moving toward what the once mighty commodity merchant has called the alternative: insolvency protection. 
In an unusually strong move, Singapore on Thursday issued a joint statement by police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore Exchange regulators that barred Noble from re-listing on the local bourse, which was part of its end-game strategy in a controversial $3.5 billion debt-for-equity re-structuring plan. 
The statement by Singapore authorities cited the start of an investigation into Noble for potential improper accounting. 
The commodity trader, which saw virtually all its stock market value wiped out before trading was suspended on SGX in November, said it had consulted its creditors and would take steps to implement the restructuring by an ""alternative process"", which may involve a court-appointed officer.
GRAPHIC: 1997 to 2018: The rise and fall of Noble Group - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PEZb2j
PLAN B?
Noble, Asia's biggest commodity trader at one time, said Singapore's block to re-listing was a ""very disappointing development"" and said it plans to restructure in forms other than by re-listing in Singapore. 
Noble did not specifically say on Friday it would seek insolvency protection, but the company has openly warned this year that if its $3.5 billion restructuring plan fails, it would begin insolvency proceedings, likely in Britain.
""Plan B is bad for shareholders and perpetual bond holders as there is no listed entity that they can hang their already thin hopes on,"" said Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor of accounting at the NUS Business School. 
The re-structuring deal itself, one of the most complex negotiated in recent years, has been highly controversial, but it saved Noble from near-certain collapse.
Noble's troubles began after Iceberg Research questioned its accounts in February 2015. To save itself, Noble has sold billions of dollars of assets, including its core businesses, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs, while defending its accounting. The trader had a market value of $6 billion nearly four years ago.
Under the proposed debt-for-equity deal, Noble's debt would be halved. In return, Noble's creditors, made up mostly of hedge funds, would own 70 percent of the restructured business, while existing shareholders' equity would be reduced to 20 percent and Noble's management would get 10 percent.
Dubbed ""New Noble"", the company wanted to transform itself into an Asia-focused coal-trading business. It was looking to list the overhauled business as part of the restructuring.
Singapore's regulator and authorities, though, took the decision to block Noble's deal after reviewing the findings of a probe, concluding that ""there are significant uncertainties about the financial position of New Noble"".

Mak said the authorities' move was ""unprecedented"" but added that there also had never been case as complicated as Noble's, ""where a restructuring with the proposed listing of a new entity happens with such serious regulatory issues hanging around it.""

Money supply growth likely remained at a record low, however, while outstanding loan growth may have eased slightly for a second month, reinforcing views that the central bank will have to ease policy further in coming months.
Surprisingly weak credit growth in October had sparked market speculation that authorities may be considering more aggressive policy action -- including China's first benchmark rate cut in three years -- to jumpstart activity.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has already cut banks' reserve requirements (RRR) four times so far in 2018, with more in coming months and possibly before the end of this year.
The PBOC also has brought down interbank market rates and is pressing banks to keep lending to cash-starved companies, though lenders are reluctant to risk another spike in bad loans.
Chinese banks were expected to have issued 1.12 trillion yuan ($162.94 billion) in net new yuan loans in November, much higher than the 697 billion yuan in October, which is typically a slow month due to seasonal factors, and roughly the same as a year earlier, according to a Reuters survey of 22 economists.
""The increase in new bank lending means there were more funds flowing into private-owned enterprises,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING in Hong Kong, noting that recent government efforts to help smaller, private firms may be starting to bear fruit.
Other key measures, however, suggest credit growth remains weak.
Broad M2 money supply growth in November was seen unchanged from the previous month at 8.0 percent, which matched a record low hit in June.
Growth of M1 money supply, which represents the level of corporate cash deposits, slid to a multi-year low in October, suggesting faltering business confidence and growing financial strains. Corporate bond defaults are already on track to hit a record this year.
Annual outstanding yuan loan growth was seen at 13.0 percent for November, slightly lower than a 13.1 percent gain in October and easing for a second month.
To be sure, loan growth in China has looked more solid on a longer horizon, with new bank loans in the first 10 months already eclipsing last year's full-year record of 13.53 trillion yuan.
But signs are emerging that loan demand has remained weak overall.
Mortgage loan growth looks set to soften as the property market cools, while special bonds issued by local governments are expected to see a decline in the past month.
Local authorities had maxed out their bond quotas after a rush of debt issuance in the third quarter, raising the risk of a start-stop cycle in infrastructure spending which the government is counting on to lead an economic turnaround.
China's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, is estimated to have risen to 1.33 trillion yuan in November after falling sharply to 728.8 billion yuan in October, according to the poll. 
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
TSF had grown 10.2 percent on year in October, again an all-time low.
China's policymakers are expected to further loosen fiscal and monetary conditions in coming months if domestic and external demand continue to deteriorate, with economists largely expecting economic conditions to get worse before they get better.

But a temporary trade war ceasefire agreed by the United and China early this month may have removed some of the more immediate pressure for strong action. Washington has pledged to hold off on further tariff measures, which had been slated for Jan. 1., to allow 90 days of negotiations with Beijing.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares fought to sustain the slimmest of recoveries on Friday amid speculation the Federal Reserve might be ""one-and-done"" with U.S. rate hikes, while oil fell anew as producers bickered over the details of an output cut.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.4 percent, though that followed a 1.8 percent drubbing on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei added 0.8 percent.
Chinese shares, which were up earlier in the day, slipped into negative territory with the blue chips off 0.1 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 too started firmer but were last down 0.1 percent.
Spreadbetters, however, pointed to a strong start for Europe with London's FTSE futures up 1.8 percent.
There was no escaping concerns over Sino-U.S. relations after the arrest of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou threatened to chill talks on some form of trade truce.
Markets also face a test from U.S. payrolls data later in the session amid speculation the economy was heading for a tough patch after years of solid growth.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the strength of the labor market in remarks made late Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast jobs rose by 200,000 in November after surging 250,000 in October.
""A view has developed of U.S. growth normalizing a little faster than expected from the fiscal 'sugar rush', while inflationary pressures remain contained given the sharp fall in the oil price,"" said National Australia Bank economist Tapa Strickland.
""Payrolls will be very important in helping to validate whether the economy is indeed slowing faster than expected.""
The mood in risk-asset markets brightened a little after the Wall Street Journal reported Fed officials are considering whether to signal a new wait-and-see mentality after a likely rate increase at their meeting in December.
That only added to recent feverish speculation the central bank was almost done hiking rates given concerns about global growth and the disinflationary impact of collapsing oil prices.
Interest rate futures <0#FF:> rallied hard in massive volumes with the market now pricing in less than one hike next year. A month ago they had been wagering on three increases.
The news helped Wall Street pare steep losses and the Dow ended Thursday down 0.32 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15 percent. The Nasdaq managed to advance 0.42 percent.
FLATTENED
Treasuries extended their blistering rally, driving 10-year yields down to a three-month trough at 2.8260 percent, before last trading at 2.89 percent.
Yields on two-year notes fell a huge 10 basis points at one stage on Thursday and were last at 2.76 percent.
Investors also steamrolled the yield curve to its flattest in over a decade, a trend that has historically presaged economic slowdowns and even recessions.
""The sort of flattening of the yield curve that we have seen recently usually indicates that investors think the Fed is nearing the end of a tightening cycle, and that rate cuts may even be on the horizon,"" argued analysts at Capital Economics.
The seismic shock spread far and wide. Yields on 10-year paper sank to the lowest in six months in Germany, almost 12 months in Canada and 16 months in Australia.
The sea change in expectations took a toll on the U.S. dollar as bulls had been counting heavily on a steady widening rate differential to propel the currency.
The greenback eased against a basket of currencies to 96.803, and fell to 112.85 yen from a 113.85 high at the start of the week. The euro was up around 0.4 percent on the week so far at $1.1366.
Crptocurrency Bitcoin took a fresh spill to be down almost 18 percent for the week at $3,363.37.
In commodity markets, gold firmed to near a five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,239 per ounce.
Oil was less favored, however, falling further as OPEC delayed a decision on output cuts while awaiting support from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia.

Brent futures slipped 52 cents to $59.54 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 40 cents to $51.09.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 01:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: GE's push to fix power turbine problem goes global,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Utilities are shutting down at least 18 of  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) newest gas turbines for repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France, according to more than a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts.
The shutdowns, which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas, come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes.
GE is setting aside $480 million to repair its 9HA, 7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business. The 126-year-old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut down, or when it would replace parts - if needed - in as many as 130 such turbines it has produced.
Power plant operators in Japan, Taiwan, France and at multiple U.S. sites have shut down - or plan to shut down - at least 18 of the 55 new HA-model turbines that GE has shipped so far, French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry experts, including executives, plant operators, insurance specialists, engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show. 
In an interview, GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data, saying that GE turbines are performing ""extremely well,"" despite the need for ""early maintenance"" to fix the blades.
Considering all of the power turbines it has in use, GE has ""the most reliable fleet in the world - 99 percent, give or take, reliability,"" he added.
GE previously disclosed that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of them in September. Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut down.
Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine, owned by  Exelon Corp  (N:EXC). The turbines are now running after two months of repairs, Exelon said.
GE told Reuters it identified the oxidation problem in 2015, and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on other turbine models.
Three plant operators using GE equipment that are shutting for blade repairs, Invenergy, Exelon and Tennessee Valley Authority, told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in installing new blades for free under warranty.
""Overall, we've been very pleased with GE's HA technology and its performance capabilities,"" said Beth Conley, a spokeswoman at Invenergy, which is receiving replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant that has not yet opened.
Following the problems in Texas, state-owned utility Electricite de France (PA:EDF) closed its plant in the northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late September for blade replacements. Bouchain was the first plant worldwide to install GE's 9HA turbine.
Bouchain has logged 86 outages for equipment failure, testing or other reasons from January 2017 to October 2018, five times the average for non-GE plants, according to data from French grid operator RTE analyzed by Reuters. Reuters excluded outages for planned maintenance.
The French data also show that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing, on average, more than twice as often as non-GE gas-fueled plants in France with turbines made by  Alstom  (PA:ALSO),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Ansaldo Energia SpA. GE acquired Alstom's power business in 2015.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3
GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the data from grid operator RTE, an independent subsidiary of EDF, are ""not wrong,"" but should not be used to assess turbine performance because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants.
EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain, which opened in 2016, and that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their break-in period. EDF said Bouchain’s output is cycled up and down to meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly. The other gas-fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and have been in operation for many years.
RTE, Siemens AG (DE:SIEGn), Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (T:7011) declined to comment.
Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how often GE's turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world. Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to be serviced or tested, or when equipment failure or other problems cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly.
While GE plants still produce a third of the world's electricity, GE fell from first to third place in new turbine orders by capacity, behind Mitsubishi and Siemens, according to a first-half tally by McCoy Power Reports, a widely watched industry data source.
GE said it booked seven HA turbine orders in the first nine months of this year, half as many as in the same period last year.
GE's HA turbines have come under particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing competition. The success of GE's new turbines are of increasing importance as it slims down to focus on power plants, jet engines and wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring. GE spent more than two decades developing the 400-ton machines, but brought them to market after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share, forcing GE to catch up.
GE undercut its rivals' prices by about 20 percent ""to go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by 2016,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a report this year.
Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE's profit and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its power unit, and its credit rating fell to just three notches above junk. Culp is splitting up the power division, consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new leaders for it.
Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23-year low, forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive.
Scott Strazik, the new chief executive of GE Gas Power, said in an interview that customers are happy with GE's response to the blade issue and GE has no plans to change how it handles customer issues, or how it tests turbines, noting GE's test facility is the largest and most comprehensive in the world.

""The HA is the fastest-selling gas turbine that we have, and customers continue to have a strong desire for the HA,"" Strazik said.

Prosecutors also plan to indict on the same day former representative director Greg Kelly as well as the automaker itself, the Nikkei said on Friday, citing unidentified sources.
The Nov. 19 arrest of Ghosn and Kelly shook the foundations of the Renault-Nissan alliance and stunned the auto industry, where Ghosn is renowned for turning around the French and Japanese carmakers. Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
Ghosn and Kelly's detention period runs until Monday, when prosecutors must decide to indict, release, or rearrest them on new claims.
The Nikkei said the two former executives and Nissan would likely be indicted over the alleged underreporting of salaries in five annual reports through the business year that ended in March 2015.
Ghosn and Kelly are also likely to be rearrested on suspicion of making misstatements in reports for the subsequent three business years, the newspaper reported.
The Nikkei said making false statements in an annual report was a crime for which not just the individuals involved but also companies can be held accountable, and prosecutors wanted to charge Nissan for not preventing the alleged crime.
Representatives for the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office and Nissan declined to comment.
Ghosn was arrested for allegedly conspiring to understate his income by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88.66 million) over five years from 2010. Kelly was accused of assisting.
Ghosn and Kelly have not made any statement through their lawyers, but Japanese media reported that they have denied the allegations.

News of the Fiat Chrysler's new plant leaked on the same day General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra was finishing a two-day visit in Washington with lawmakers furious over the carmaker's plan to close five North American assembly plants next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs due to weak demand for sedans and small cars in the U.S. market.
Fiat Chrysler plans to revive Mack Avenue Engine II, which has been idled since 2012, as a vehicle assembly plant to provide additional capacity to build the redesigned Grand Cherokee, including a new three-row version, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.
FCA, which phased out production of sedans in the U.S. market, builds its two-row Grand Cherokee at its Jefferson North plant and needs additional capacity.
The move could add at least 100 and up to 400 jobs in the city, according to the Detroit News, which earlier reported on Fiat's plans. However, a source told Reuters the employment figures will be much higher.
News of Fiat Chrysler's plan may put pressure on GM to respond, coming moments before Barra approached the cameras on Capitol Hill to discuss her meetings with lawmakers. 
GM has come under intense criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as U.S. President Donald Trump for its plan, with many asking the automaker to reverse its decision.
Last week, Trump demanded GM add a new product at a plant in Ohio targeted for closure and later threatened to cut electric vehicle subsidies.
Trump has repeatedly praised Fiat Chrysler for announcing it would shift truck production from Mexico to the United States. The White House did not immediately comment on Fiat Chrysler’s plans on Thursday.

GM's closures could become a campaign issue in 2020, with Democrats arguing it is evidence the corporate tax cuts approved a year ago have not deterred companies from closing plants. Trump made restoring auto production a top priority of his campaign - and also praised Germany's BMW for considering plans to build a new transmission plant in the United States.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. probe of China's Huawei includes bank fraud accusations: sources,"By Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer was arrested as part of a U.S. investigation into an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, according to people familiar with the probe.
The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei shipped U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, Reuters reported in April. 
More recently, the probe has included whether the company used  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) to conduct illegal transactions involving Iran, the people said. 
Companies are barred from using the U.S. financial system to funnel goods and services to sanctioned entities. If the mobile phone and telecoms equipment maker conducted such transactions and then misled HSBC about their true nature, it could be guilty of bank fraud, experts say. 
Huawei declined to comment, but said in a statement after the arrest that it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations.
An HSBC spokesperson declined to comment. HSBC is not under investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which Reuters has reported is the office investigating Huawei, also declined to comment.
In 2012, HSBC paid $1.92 billion and entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the same U.S. prosecutor's office for violating U.S. sanctions and money-laundering laws. 
As part of that deal, HSBC was required to be monitored for five years to review its efforts to prevent money laundering and sanctions violations. 
HSBC's U.S.-listed shares fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday after Reuters reported the bank's link to the Huawei case. They ended down 3.6 percent.
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1. She will appear in court on Friday and faces extradition to the United States. The news broke on Wednesday, roiling global stock markets over fears the move could escalate the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Huawei said it has been provided little information of the charges and that it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng."" 
SHADES OF ZTE 
The probe of Huawei is similar to one that threatened the survival of China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763), which pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran. ZTE paid a $892 million penalty.
Earlier this year, the United States said ZTE made false statements about disciplining some executives responsible for the violations and banned U.S. firms from selling parts and software to the company. After ceasing major operations as a result, ZTE paid another $1 billion as part of a deal to get the ban lifted.
In an incident similar to Meng's case, ZTE's chief financial officer was stopped at Boston's Logan Airport during the U.S. investigation of that company, according to sources familiar with the case. U.S. authorities seized a laptop that contained a ""treasure trove"" of evidence of ZTE's illegal business in Iran, one of the sources said.
In 2016, the Commerce Department made documents public that showed ZTE’s misconduct and also revealed how a second company, identified only as F7, had successfully evaded U.S. export controls. 
In a 2016 letter to the Commerce Department, 10 U.S. lawmakers said F7 was believed to be Huawei, citing media reports. In April 2017, lawmakers sent another letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking for F7 to be publicly identified and fully investigated.
U.S. authorities also subpoenaed Huawei in 2016 seeking information related to possible export and sanctions violations, sources have said. 
In January 2013, Reuters reported that Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator, had much closer ties to Huawei than previously known.

Meng, who also has used the English names Cathy and Sabrina, served on the board of Skycom between February 2008 and April 2009, according to Skycom records. Several other past and present Skycom directors also appear to have connections to Huawei.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online cosmetics retailer Birchbox made its debut inside several Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc stores across the United States on Thursday, one of many e-commerce companies expanding its physical presence to better connect with shoppers and drive sales.
Birchbox, which has two of its own stores in New York City and Paris, is among the many direct-to-consumer brands that are going brick-and-mortar as well as online to increase shopping options. Even Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchased Whole Foods, with about 500 stores, for $13.7 billion in 2017 to boost its grocery business. Walgreens would help Birchbox better serve ""casual beauty customers"" who are not a focus of the industry, Birchbox Chief Executive Katia Beauchamp said in an interview at a Duane Reade drugstore in Lower Manhattan. It is one of six Walgreens outlets that are part of Thursday's launch in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Minneapolis' Mall of America. 
Birchbox is targeting customers who do not regularly buy beauty products, Beauchamp said. ""We kept saying that this customer - the 'casual consumer' - doesn't have a home, so let's build her a home.""
""We have huge aspirations about digital and physical coming together,"" she said. ""We think that the opportunity to serve the everyday consumer is a very big opportunity and we're looking at where and how fast can we do it."" 
Birchbox, which has a subscription-based model, said it will offer fewer options and more in-store direction and guidance so customers can discover skincare, makeup and hair products from more than 40 prestige brands quickly and easily, including COOLA, Sand & Sky, Wander Beauty and Beachwaver. 
In 2019, New York-based Birchbox plans to enter five additional Walgreens stores in Dallas, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles in a major push to give customers a more hands-on experience in buying physical beauty products.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>","Moderna to raise $618 million in upsized IPO, braving market jitters: sources","By Lance Tupper and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) is set to sell around $618 million in shares in its initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said, braving stock market jitters to sell more stock than originally planned. 
In the biggest flotation of a biotechnology company since 2016, Moderna expected to sell roughly 26.86 million shares at $23 per share, the person said. Moderna had originally planned to sell 21.7 million shares for between $22 and $24 per share. 
Moderna, which is due to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday under the ticker ""MRNA,"" did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The pricing was a good test of the IPO market as it came following another turbulent day in the U.S. stock market, amid investor concerns over the trade dispute between the United States and China. 
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna had scaled back its fundraising expectations in the run-up to the IPO in light of the stock market volatility, which makes for a more uncertain environment for new listings, according to one source familiar with the matter.
However, demand for the IPO was supported by a substantial amount of premarketing done with investors in preparation of the IPO, the source said. 
Biotech IPOs have performed strongly this year, returning on average around 14 percent in 2018 as of Nov. 30, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers data, compared to a broadly flat S&P 500 Index (SPX) year to date.
""Given the unique nature of these IPOs involving crossover investors, their strong returns, the rapid advances in science due to ""Big Data"" innovations and the expectation of big Pharma scooping up promising young companies, we expect the Pharma Life Sciences sector to keep leading the broader IPO market in 2019,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at PwC.
More IPOs of big, unlisted technology companies are expected. Earlier on Thursday, Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc beat bigger rival Uber Technologies in filing for an IPO.
Moderna develops therapeutic drugs for infectious diseases and immuno-oncology, and has said it intends to use a major portion of the net proceeds on drug discovery and development.
 Morgan Stanley  & Co LLC (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are among the lead underwriting banks for Moderna's IPO.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Thursday that the regulator will consider stricter rules for submitting shareholder proposals at annual meetings, including the ownership and resubmission threshold.
Jay Clayton, in an address outlining the regulator's agenda for 2019, told an audience at a New York event hosted by Columbia University's School of International Public Affairs that the SEC would also consider subjecting proxy advisory firms to stricter requirements for transparency and conflict of interest disclosure.
Last month, Reuters reported that the SEC was poised to consider changes to the rules that allow company shareholders to advance special resolutions on charged issues like climate change and gun violence.
Industry groups say the rules allow special interests and proxy advisory firms that recommend how investors should vote to hijack corporate boardrooms with costly demands.
The move could set up the SEC for a clash with investors, who worry any rule changes would diminish their ability to hold company management accountable.
Earlier on Thursday, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson also called for the regulator to consider imposing stricter disclosure requirements on institutional fund managers relating to how they vote in corporate elections.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors showed skepticism of bonds despite gains in the market, pulling the most cash from the investments in five weeks, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
The $5.5 billion of net withdrawals from U.S.-based bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the week ended Dec. 5 came despite strong demand pushing bond prices higher. The average U.S.-based taxable-bond fund gained 0.21 percent over that period from market performance, according to the research service.
U.S.-based bond funds have already posted $64.9 billion in withdrawals since October, marking the worst quarter since the same period in 2008, during the financial crisis.
For the moment, markets appear to be betting on weaker U.S. economic growth, softer inflation and a slowdown in Federal Reserve rate hikes. Yields, which fall as a bond's demand rises, collapsed from 3.26 percent just last month to 2.89 percent on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) as of Thursday. Stocks also sold off this week and U.S.-based equity funds posted $289 million of withdrawals. (N)
The market is testing the Fed's willingness to keep hiking rates and shrinking its cache of bonds bought after the 2007-09 global financial crisis to spur lending and investment, said Sage Advisory Services Ltd Co President Bob Smith.
""What the Fed is trying to do is deflate all the balloons in the party so the kids don't notice it,"" he said.
""The equity traders of this world are a little childish sometimes in terms of what they want, and there can be tantrums.""
Meanwhile, corporate leverage is near record highs, according to Fed data, and short-sellers' bets on a decline in credit are building up in the ETF market.
During the latest week at least $1 billion poured out of investment-grade and leveraged-loan funds apiece, according to the Lipper data. Hundreds of millions more trickled out of high-yield bonds and Treasuries.

Emerging market stocks, meanwhile, pulled in $1.5 billion, the most cash since March. U.S. dollar weakness due to a pause in Fed hikes could lend a helping hand to countries that borrowed in greenbacks, making emerging markets one of the few places to take extra risk at the moment, Smith said.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>",GM CEO faces harsh criticism from U.S. lawmakers over Mexico investments,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Chief Executive (N:GM) Mary Barra came under harsh criticism from members of Congress from Michigan on Thursday for building a new vehicle in Mexico while ending production at five North American assembly plants and cutting nearly 15,000 jobs.
On the second day of meetings on Capitol Hill, Barra faced a tough session with normally supportive lawmakers from the state where GM is based and has thousands of workers.
Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, questioned why GM was launching production of its new Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico as it was cutting production in the United States and said the company needs to move the vehicle to the United States.
""We did get answers as to some of the decisions that they made. But I think they need to revisit that thought process and understand the importance of making (vehicles) locally,"" Peters said. ""The reason you have excess capacity in the United States is because you've built capacity in Mexico.""
In 2014, GM announced it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 to modernize and expand its manufacturing facilities there. GM says that since 2009 it has invested $22 billion in U.S. facilities.
Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said GM pays less than $3 an hour at four plants in Mexico, a fraction of what it pays in the United States.
""It’s been very profitable to leave the United States and go to Mexico,"" Levin said of GM's expanded production of trucks and SUVs in Mexico.
Lawmakers were angered by the lack of notice before GM's job cut announcement last week and wanted assurances that GM would not be closing additional U.S. plants.
Barra told reporters after the meetings it was ""important for General Motors to make necessary but incredibly difficult changes.""
GM is ending production at its Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant next year, as well as at its Warren Transmission plant in suburban Detroit, along with plants in Ohio, Maryland and Canada and eliminating about 8,000 salaried positions.
Barra said the decision to build the Blazer in Mexico, which was announced in June, ""was made many years ago.""
She told Reuters on Wednesday it would be ""very costly"" to reverse course because the new SUV was launching in days. She also noted GM is launching a number of new vehicles in Michigan next year.
Asked if any more U.S. facilities were at risk of closing, Barra said GM ""looked at what steps we needed to take to strengthen the company... We think the steps we've taken are what's necessary for our future.""
Representative Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, said lawmakers were caught off guard by the job cuts and expressed their anger, but added, ""nothing was thrown.""
Representative Brenda Lawrence, who represents Detroit, said lawmakers were putting GM was on notice about future production decisions, noting the company is making strong profits and got a massive taxpayer bailout a decade ago.

“We are watching the decisions they are making,” Lawrence said.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:48PM ET</span>",Ride-hail firm Lyft races to leave Uber behind in IPO chase,"By Joshua Franklin and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc beat bigger rival Uber Technologies Inc in filing for an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, defying the recent market jitters and taking the lead on a string of billion-dollar-plus tech companies expected to join Wall Street next year.
Lyft's IPO will test investors' appetite for the most highly valued Silicon Valley companies and for the ride-hailing business, which has become a wildly popular service but remains unprofitable and has an uncertain future with the advance of self-driving cars.
San Francisco-based Lyft, last valued at about $15 billion in a private fundraising round, did not specify the number of shares it was selling or the price range in a confidential filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Lyft could go public as early as the first quarter of 2019, based on how quickly the SEC reviews its filing, people familiar with the matter said. Lyft's valuation is likely to end up between $20 billion and $30 billion, one source added.
The ride service was set up in 2012 by entrepreneurs John Zimmer and Logan Green and has raised close to $5 billion from investors. While it continues to grow faster than its larger competitor, Uber, it is also losing money.
Lyft would follow a string of high-profile IPOs of technology companies valued at more than $1 billion this year, such as Dropbox Inc and Spotify Technology SA.
However, market turmoil fueled by the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China could dampen enthusiasm for the debuts of other 2019 hopefuls like apartment-rental service Airbnb Inc, analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Stripe Inc, a digital payment company. Including Lyft, these round out four of the top-10 most highly valued, venture-backed tech companies.
""Market declines mean that the offer price will be lower than otherwise. But there's a danger of waiting to go public as well. Markets could go even lower, and the companies could raise less money if they waited longer,"" said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida.
Such fears have pushed some companies to hustle. Uber moved its target IPO date up from the second half of next year to the first half. Some venture capitalists said they are urging portfolio companies that had been planning a public debut in the next 18 months to hurry up and file.
In a key test for the U.S. IPO market on Thursday, Moderna Inc is considering selling up to 20 percent more shares than originally planned in its IPO, allaying concerns that the stock market tumult could derail the biggest flotation of a biotechnology company since 2016, Reuters reported.
FLAG IN THE GROUND
The filing by Lyft, which hired JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Jefferies as underwriters, plants a flag in the ground to go public before larger rival Uber. The race between them is one of the most closely watched in Silicon Valley.
A provision included in an investment by SoftBank into Uber requires the company to file for an IPO by Sept. 30 or the company risks allowing restrictions on shareholder stock transfers to expire.
Uber investor Mitchell Green, a partner at Lead Edge Capital, said Lyft going public first bodes well for Uber, because if Lyft trades at a high multiple, the much-larger Uber will command even more money.
""Lyft has built a very U.S.-based rideshare business that has done well,"" Green said. ""If public market investors get excited about that they are really going to get excited about a business that is 5X the size.”
Earlier this year, Lyft said it had 35 percent of the U.S. ride-hailing market. The company operates in the United States and Canada, while Uber is in much of the world and has other businesses including freight-hailing and food delivery. 
Both Uber and Lyft have lost huge sums of money by spending heavily competing with each other for passengers and drivers and entering new markets, although they have recently raised prices and reduced subsidies. The companies have held out the promise of boosting profitability by eventually replacing human drivers with robots piloting autonomous vehicles, but a future of cities and suburbs crisscrossed by fleets of self-driving cars is years away, given the technical and regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States.
""With autonomous cars on the horizon, it is anyone's guess where this sector goes in the future,"" said Jeff Zell, senior research analyst and a partner at IPO Boutique in Florida. 
Lyft in particular is one of the newest entrants to self-driving and has only a small robo-taxi service in Las Vegas using another company's technology. Its investors include General Motors (NYSE:GM) Corp, which holds a 9 percent stake in Lyft that it acquired for $500 million in 2016, but GM has wound down its cooperation with Lyft, choosing instead to acquire the autonomous car company Cruise.

Lyft presents other risks, including unresolved questions about its workforce of independent contractor drivers. A decision by the California Supreme Court earlier this year, which makes it easier for workers to prove they are employees and sets a higher standard for companies to treat workers as contractors, threatens to upend Lyft and Uber’s business models. Both companies face legal battles with drivers over their classification.

914,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:18PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Nonfarm Payrolls Expected to Rise 200K
The labor report will, as usual, be the likely driver of the market tomorrow.
The Labor Department releases the November numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose 200,000, down from October.
The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at 3.7%.
Average hourly earnings, which will be especially important for those looking at possible Federal Reserve rate hike in 2019, are expected to tick up by 0.3%.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of consumer sentiment. Economists expect the index to tick down to 97.1.
2. OPEC Decision in Question
Oil traders will be closely watching to see if OPEC and Russia agree to a production cut tomorrow.
Crude oil fell today as a tumble in equities and hesitance from Russia to back any supply reduction hurt sentiment.
The United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia have raised their oil production to record highs in recent months, turning out about 11 million barrels per day of oil.
""(T)he market's attention is totally on OPEC,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors, an oil-focused fund in New York. ""The Russians are looking they don't want to give in to a big cut. There's also a huge risk-off on Wall Street that's adding to the heat on oil.""
3. Big Lots Reports Earnings
Although the earnings calendar is almost empty tomorrow, there are still some more retail numbers to be had.
Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) reports before the bell, with analysts predicting a loss of a penny per share on sales of more than $1.1 billion.
Shares have been volatile, but the stock is down in the last three months."
915,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:08PM ET</span>",Embraer-Boeing aviation deal blocked by Brazilian court,"By Ricardo Brito and Marcelo Rochabrun
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal court on Thursday granted an injunction blocking the proposed tie-up between U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), a deal the Brazilian company says is crucial to its survival.
Embraer shares in Sao Paulo closed 2.42 percent lower, although it remained too early to say whether the injunction will actually block or significantly affect the deal. Labor groups in Brazil often bring court challenges against significant business deals and the injunction could be reversed.
The decision forbids Embraer's board of directors from signing the deal to create a joint venture on commercial aviation that Boeing would control. Boeing declined to comment and Embraer did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
The legal action was brought by four congressmen with Brazil's left-wing Workers Party.
The companies announced in July that Embraer would sell 80 percent of its commercial aviation business to Boeing in a deal valuing that segment at $4.75 billion. Embraer, among the world's largest makers of mid-sized planes of up to 150 passengers, used to compete in that segment with Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).
The deal has stalled partly because the Brazilian government, which has veto power at the planemaker, has been reluctant to give it a greenlight. Only then could the company call a shareholders meeting to approve it.
In his decision, judge Victorio Giuizio Neto cast doubt that the proposed deal would be good for Embraer's bottom line. 
""The reason is very simple, Boeing is not giving up anything"" in this transaction, he wrote. The decision says Embraer would give up its profitable commercial division. 
He added that the new company would threaten the rights of the Brazilian government because it would restrict its control over Embraer to the part of the company that will not be sold to Boeing. 
Bombardier spun off its mid-sized commercial jet division earlier this year after selling a controlling stake to Boeing rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
The deal between Boeing and Embraer is widely seen as a reaction to an earlier deal between that joint venture. 
Boeing and Airbus historically have produced larger aircraft than Embraer and Bombardier. But the mid-sized segment is expected to grow substantially, which would give Airbus a significant advantage over Boeing unless the U.S. planemaker also expands into that market. 

Brazil President Michel Temer said he would leave the decision to the future administration, which takes office Jan. 1. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has said he is in favor of the deal.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 04:54PM ET</span>",Sears Chairman Lampert makes $4.6 billion bid for bankrupt retailer,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) Chairman Eddie Lampert's ESL Investments Inc has made an offer valued at $4.6 billion to buy the bankrupt U.S. retailer, one of the only options that would prevent the department store chain from shutting its doors for good.
Lampert's offer calls for about 500 Sears stores to remain open and would keep 50,000 of the retailer's workers employed, according to a letter from his hedge fund filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. 
The 125-year-old company faces a series of deadlines this month to find a buyer that would keep it in business as some of its creditors call for it to shut down, claiming they would be repaid more through going-out-of-business sales. 
Preliminary indications of interest for Sears assets were due Wednesday, according to court papers. 
Many retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including toy seller Toys R Us Inc and department store Bon-Ton Stores Inc, have liquidated after no viable offers to keep the companies open were made.
ESL's takeover bid features financing from a variety of sources and a complicated structure not uncommon in bankruptcy auctions. For starters, the hedge fund proposes to raise up to $1.7 billion in cash through a series of maneuvers that include Sears seeking a new loan backed by collateral and issuing new notes.
The hedge fund, the retailer's largest shareholder and creditor, would also forgive $1.8 billion Sears owes it in exchange for the company's assets, a bankruptcy maneuver known as credit bidding. Finally, ESL would assume $1.1 billion in existing Sears liabilities, such as gift cards the department-store chain issued. 
Lampert's hedge fund has been working on a bid for Sears since the company filed for bankruptcy in October. The hedge fund manager was the chief executive of Sears until it filed for bankruptcy. 
In his bid, ESL also proposes to acquire Sears Auto Centers, appliance brand Kenmore, battery line DieHard and the retailer’s home services division, the largest U.S. appliance repair provider, the letter said.
The retailer is attracting interest from outsiders, and Sears' attorneys have said they will analyze bids to maximize value. Retailer Ace Hardware Corp and investment firm Centerbridge Partners LP were together eyeing an offer for Sears' home services division, Reuters reported this week. 
Firms that specialize in going-out-of-business sales, so-called liquidators, were also expected to make preliminary offers to shut Sears down, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Sears clinched a $350 million loan from creditor Cyrus Capital Partners LP in November to help it stay in business through the holidays.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>","Taking aim at Intel, Qualcomm launches chip for business PCs","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, on Thursday pushed further into the PC market with a line of chips designed to power business machines.
Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon"" processor chips historically have been at the heart of mobile phones like Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Pixel phone and many  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) devices.
Over the past year, though, Qualcomm adapted its chips to operate PCs running Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Windows operating system, making those machines start up more quickly and stay connected to the Internet constantly, much like a mobile phone or tablet.
But the chips Qualcomm used in those early PCs were essentially modified versions of the chips it sold for mobile phones. At an event in Hawaii on Thursday, Qualcomm officials said they have created a new series of chips called the Snapdragon 8cx that will be dedicated to PCs.
The biggest difference is the new Qualcomm chips will support Windows 10 Enterprise, the version of Microsoft's popular operating system that is sold to businesses. Previous Qualcomm chips supported only the consumer versions of Windows, making business customers less likely to purchase computers powered by them.
Qualcomm's move puts it in greater competition with chipmaker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), which last year still derived more than half of its $62.8 billion in revenue from PC chips and dominates that market. Intel's association with Windows PCs was so strong that the computer industry referred to them as ""Wintel"" machines for decades.

Qualcomm and others are also challenging Intel's supremacy in the data center business. Qualcomm's chips are powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Several companies - including Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) cloud division Amazon Web Services, a major Intel customer - are working to make ARM-based chips suitable for data centers. [nL2N1Y31HG]

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday rejected requests by a Standard & Poor's credit ratings analyst and a friend to dismiss criminal insider trading charges related to the $9.3 billion merger of paint makers Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW) and Valspar Corp.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the indictment's failure to allege that the analyst Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz and Jeremy Millul, a jeweler in Manhattan's Diamond District, shared a ""meaningfully close personal relationship"" didn't matter because it said Pinto-Thomaz had an ""intention to benefit"" Millul.
Prosecutors accused Pinto-Thomaz of tipping Millul and another friend in March 2016 about the impending merger after learning about it confidentially at work, and that the friends made about $300,000 trading on his tips.
Pinto-Thomaz and Millul argued that a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision rejecting the Manhattan federal appeals court's narrow view of insider trading left intact that court's requirement that a tipper and tippee share a close relationship for there to be insider trading.
But Rakoff, who has called on Congress to simplify insider trading law and bemoaned courts that have ""somehow managed to complicate"" it, said that relationship isn't required if there was a quid pro quo or an intention to benefit a tippee.
""The indictment's allegations that Pinto-Thomaz gave information to Millul with the intention to benefit Millul is directly, explicitly encompassed by (a Supreme Court) rule concerning 'intention to benefit the particular recipient,'"" Rakoff wrote.
Lawyers for Pinto-Thomaz and Millul did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.
S&P had suspended Pinto-Thomaz when the charges were announced in June. His current employment status could not immediately be determined.
The other friend, Abell Oujaddou, who runs an upscale hair salon in Manhattan's Flatiron District, pleaded guilty to insider trading in October.
Millul is trying to sever his case from Pinto-Thomaz's so that he is not unfairly implicated in Oujaddou's trading.
Shares of Valspar surged 23 percent on the first trading day after Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams announced it would buy the company. The merger closed on June 1, 2017.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped back to losses for the year on Thursday, as U.S. stocks fell on mounting worries of slowing global growth after a fresh twist in China-U.S. tensions as well as lower oil prices and U.S. bond yields.
The arrest of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer at the request of the United States cast fresh doubts over the prospect of Beijing and Washington striking a deal on trade tariffs in their 90-day truce period.
""Markets are extremely sensitive to any news regarding trade. The potential slowdown in global growth is also something the markets are pricing in,"" said Massud Ghaussy, senior analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence in New York.
The Dow and the S&P were down more than 1.5 percent, tracking 0.4 percent losses for the year despite coming well off their session lows. The two indexes and the Nasdaq had tumbled more than 3 percent each on Tuesday.
Optimism after the trade truce over the weekend boosted Wall Street on Monday, extending a rally from last week when the Federal Reserve signaled a slower pace of interest rate hikes.
But that optimism faded on Tuesday and, along with a drop in longer-dated U.S Treasury yields, triggered a slide in equities that continued on Thursday. Markets were closed on Wednesday.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield held at three-month lows as traders bet on fewer rate hikes after data showed U.S. trade deficit hit a 10-year high in October and that the pace of job growth was moderating. [US/]
""We have a repricing of risk as shown in rising bonds (prices), but is obviously adding to the negativity in equities,"" said Ghaussy.
Crude oil prices fell after an OPEC meeting in Vienna over production policy ended without a decision. Earlier the group signaled it may agree to a smaller cut than expected. [O/R]
All the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red. Technology (SPLRCT) fell 0.90 percent, energy (SPNY) 3.27 percent and the trade-sensitive industrials (SPLRCI) 2.07 percent.
The biggest drag came from a 2.90-percent slump in financials (SPSY) as bond yields fell and bets of a rate hike were pushed lower.
At 1:02 p.m. ET, the (DJI) was down 450.24 points, or 1.80 percent, at 24,576.83, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 39.13 points, or 1.45 percent, at 2,660.93 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 40.15 points, or 0.56 percent, at 7,118.28.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P, jumped to its highest since Oct. 29.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell 1.8 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P and the Nasdaq, while Boeing Co's (N:BA) 4.5 percent decline weighed the most on the Dow.
Gains in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) kept the communication services sector (SPLRCL) flat. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.38-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.20-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 70 new lows. The Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 337 new lows.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 01:35PM ET</span>",Employee rights group says Wells Fargo declined planned meeting,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - A union-backed bank employee rights group is complaining after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co declined to meet with members last week, according to a letter sent to Chief Executive Tim Sloan viewed exclusively by Reuters.
Members of the group, Committee for Better Banks (CBB), were scheduled to meet with Wells Fargo representatives on Wednesday, but the meeting was canceled after the two sides could not agree on terms. The company said CBB members who were not Wells Fargo employees would not be allowed to attend.
Wells Fargo is not unionized. CBB-backed whistleblowers helped reveal the sales practice scandal in 2016 that resulted in hefty fines and penalties for the bank.
Nick Wiener, a CBB organizer, said the group was clear about its intention to bring CBB organizers to the meeting from the outset, and that the group had received a verbal green light from a representative of Wells Fargo management. 
Wells Fargo said it only committed to an internal meeting with team members who happened to be a part of CBB.
""We value opportunities to engage and meet with our team members,"" said Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk. ""We were disappointed that the meeting did not occur, and we remain available to meet with the team members in the future.""
CBB said it is critical to have non-Wells Fargo CBB members present so that employees could voice their opinions without fear of retaliation.
""Given Wells Fargo’s track record of firing and blackballing employees who spoke out against the unethical and fraudulent banking practices they were pressured to perform, it’s simply unacceptable that your team is placing restrictions on who should attend a meeting,"" said the letter, which was sent on Wednesday and signed by Christopher Shelton, president of Communications Workers of America, which supports CBB.
The bank has taken several steps aimed at rebuilding the trust of employees, customers and investors, including eliminating product sales goals for retail workers, raising wages, and hiring back nearly 2,000 employees who quit or were fired. Sloan has also been hosting town halls to hear employee concerns.
The effort comes as the bank faces investor pressure to cut costs.

Wells Fargo, the largest bank employer in the United States with roughly 265,000 employees as of October, recently announced plans to reduce its workforce by 5 percent to 10 percent.

U.S. oil prices, however, did find some reprieve, helping energy move off lows as the Energy Information Administration's weekly petroleum data showed domestic crude supplies fell sharply. But U.S. production, which remained at record highs, staved off a more meaningful recovery in oil prices.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) fell 3%, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) fell 8.43% and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) fell 6%.
The arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada, meanwhile, reportedly at the behest of U.S. officials, raised fears that the fragile trade war ceasefire between the United States and China may collapse, sending trade-sensitive sectors tumbling.
Industrials, home to trade bellwethers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), dropped more than 2%, keeping the broader market on the back foot.
Elsewhere bank stocks, which have come under pressure from an ongoing slump in U.S. government bond yields, were thrown into further turmoil after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) hinted at a profit warning on Wednesday.
Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said Wednesday the bank expects market revenue in the current quarter to be slightly lower than last year, sending the stock more than 5% lower.
Weakness in shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, resumed the wreck in tech after smartphone camera lens supplier Largan (TW:3008) reported a 29% slump in its sales for November from a year earlier, pointing to weakness in smartphone demand.
Among other FANG stocks, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 1% after Stifel downgraded company to hold from buy on worries that potential political and regulatory blowback may lead to restrictions on how the social media giant operates over time.
In political news, the U..S. Congress passed a measure to keep the government funded for two more weeks, averting Friday’s shutdown deadline, allowing lawmakers more time to reach a consensus on spending and Trump's demand for $5 billion to fund his proposed border wall.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) defended its record in fighting money laundering on Thursday after the Financial Times reported it had processed 31 billion euros ($35 billion) more in questionable funds for  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) than previously thought.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on the FT article. He said, however, that it was not Deutsche's responsibility to vet Danske Bank's customers and that business ties with the Danish bank had been cut in 2015.
The sum came on top of $150 billion Deutsche cleared for Danske's Estonian branch from 2007-15, meaning it handled four-fifths of the flows from the Danish bank's clients in Russia and the former Soviet Union, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
""We have continuously intensified our efforts over the past years against money laundering and tax evasion,"" Deutsche's Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke, said in a statement.
The bank is also under investigation in a separate German case linked to the so-called Panama Papers, a trove of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that was leaked to the media in April 2016.
Prosecutors raided Deutsche's Frankfurt offices for two days last week as part of a probe into whether it may have helped customers set up companies in tax havens to skirt money-laundering safeguards.
Von Moltke, speaking earlier to CNBC, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing on Deutsche's part in the Panama Papers case and noted that a subsidiary under investigation was sold earlier this year.
A whistleblower who revealed alleged money-laundering involving Danske Bank said last month that a major European bank had helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said he was referring to Deutsche Bank.
Deutsche has said only that it processed payments for Danske but severed ties after identifying suspicious transactions.
Deutsche's shares slid by 4 percent on Thursday to a new historic low, dealing a fresh blow to Chief Executive Christian Sewing's bid to stabilise the bank after three years of losses under previous management.
Speaking on CNBC, von Moltke said the share price was a concern but reiterated that Deutsche would hit its targets and return to profit this year. Asked whether clients were withdrawing money, he said the reaction of customers was very limited.
Deutsche shares have shed more than half their value this year, and now value the bank at 16.7 billion euros ($19 billion). 
Five-year credit default swaps, the cost of insurance on its debts, rose 16 percent on Thursday to 221.5 basis points. They now price in a 17.3 percent probability of default, according to Refinitiv data.
Sewing, an insider appointed in April, has sought to make a clean break after previous leadership became a byword for spiralling compensation and risky investment banking deals.
That legacy has hampered his attempt to return Deutsche to its roots as Germany's premier commercial bank. Sewing has repeatedly rebutted speculation that Deutsche will end up having to merge, possibly with fellow struggler Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Von Moltke said the lender had made it easier to spot potential money laundering by reducing the total number of correspondent banks it deals with by 40 percent since 2016 and tightening scrutiny of customers.
""The current management has conducted itself with a real focus on our compliance and our control systems,"" he said. ""We’ve made enormous investments and these investments are showing themselves.""

931,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Ericsson sorry for software glitch that hits mobile services in Britain and Japan,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) apologized and said it was working hard to fix a software glitch that was responsible for millions of smartphone users in Britain, Japan and other countries losing internet access on Thursday.
O2 (MC:TEF), Britain's second biggest network, and Japan's Softbank (T:9984), both Ericsson customers, reported outages on their 4G networks earlier on Thursday.
The mobile network equipment maker confirmed that a problem with its software was to blame for the disruption which hit the two operators as well as others in multiple markets.
Ericsson's President and Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said: ""The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned and we apologize not only to our customers but also to their customers. 
""We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible."" 
SoftBank said earlier the outages stemmed from problems at exchanges for its high-speed wireless LTE network - known as 4G.
The Japanese company, which plans to list its domestic unit in a $21 billion IPO later this month, said the problem was resolved after four and a half hours by reverting to an older version of Ericsson's software.
It said it had been told by Ericsson that operators in 11 countries were affected by the glitch.
Ericsson said an initial analysis indicated that expired certificates in the software versions installed with the affected customers were to blame. 
It said most of the affected customers' network services have been successfully restored during the course of the day, and it was working closely with the remaining customers still experiencing issues. 
O2, which is owned by Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), said customers of  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Mobile, Sky Mobile and GiffGaff, which all use its network, were affected by the outage.
O2 chief executive Mark Evans said his teams were working hard with Ericsson to find a swift solution.
Users of O2 services, who were unable to access the internet or apps that require an internet connection, found their way on to social media to complain about the outage, which also knocked out London bus live information displays.
Ericsson was once the world's biggest supplier of mobile communications gear but has been overtaken by China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
It has staked its recovery on demand for next-generation 5G equipment and could be well placed to benefit from current turmoil surrounding market leader Huawei amid U.S., Chinese tensions which came under the spotlight on Thursday. 
Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the Chinese company's founder and CEO, was arrested in Canada on Wednesday, at the behest of U.S. authorities investigating alleged violations of U.S. trade sanctions, according to a source. 

The United States had already taken steps to block the company's equipment from mobile networks over security concerns, and Australia and New Zealand have barred the supplier from new 5G networks for the same reason.

Kent, 65, held the reins of the company as chief executive and chairman from 2009 until 2017. He continued as chairman after Quincey became the chief executive.
Kent's departure will be the second-high profile change in the beverage industry following  Pepsico  Inc (O:PEP) Chief Executive Officer Indira Nooyi's decision to step down as chief executive of the company in October. She is also expected to relinquish her position as Chairman in early 2019. 
""One of the most important jobs of a chairman is to ensure that a strong leadership succession plan is in place,"" Kent said in a statement on Thursday.
""I'm delighted that the board has elected James as chairman. He is the right leader to take the Coca-Cola system to the next level and through the next decade.""
Kent has been credited with spearheading Coca-Cola's move away from sugary sodas towards health and energy drinks. Under his leadership, the soda-maker made investments in energy drinks maker  Monster Beverage  Corp (O:MNST) in 2014, organic juice maker Suja Life LLC in 2015, among others. 
During his tenure as CEO, Kent drove Coke's sales up by about 39 percent, while its shares rose about 60 percent. Kent also led the consolidation of the company's bottling system that helped it reduce costs.
The company on Thursday also said the board had elected Maria Lagomasino as lead independent director to succeed Sam Nunn, who would step down from board after 22 years as a director. 

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) component Coca-Cola's shares were down 1.6 percent in noon trading, largely in-line with a nearly 2 percent decline in the benchmark.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A unit of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will pay the U.S. government $360 million to resolve an investigation into its financial support of a charity that helped Medicare patients cover out-of-pocket drug costs, the Department of Justice said on Thursday.
The settlement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc, which became a subsidiary of J&J following a 2017 acquisition, was the largest so far to result from an industry-wide probe into drugmakers' support of patient assistance charities.
The government alleged Actelion from 2014 to 2015 used a charity as a conduit to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of thousands of Medicare patients using its pulmonary artery hypertension treatments Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Opsumit.
That charity, Caring Voice Coalition, has stopped providing aid after the government in 2017 revoked its approval to do so because of concerns drugmakers had improper influence over it.
Actelion did not admit wrongdoing. Caroline Pavis, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement the conduct pre-dated New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J's acquisition of Actelion and that it was committed to following the law.
Caring Voice Coalition had no immediate comment.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent. 
Amid increased attention on rising drug prices in the United States, there has been concern that donations from drugmakers to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation.
A probe led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts has led to allegations that several drugmakers used these charitable foundations as a means to pay Medicare patients' co-pays in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
In Actelion's case, the government alleged it routinely obtained data from Caring Voice Coalition regarding the extent that patients it helped used its drugs. The company then used that information to budget for future payments to the charity.
Caring Voice Coalition was at the center of an earlier, $210 million settlement by United Therapeutics Corp in December 2017, which resolved claims the company improperly used the charity to cover co-payments.
Several other drugmakers have, since 2015, disclosed receiving subpoenas as a result of the investigation.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) in May resolved similar allegations involving a different charity for nearly $23.85 million.

Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and Lundbeck earlier this year disclosed they had reached agreements to resolve similar claims for $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 12:23PM ET</span>",U.S. securities regulator should demand more voting disclosure from fund managers: official,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator should consider imposing stricter disclosure requirements on institutional fund managers relating to how they vote in corporate elections, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said on Thursday.
The growing power of passive index funds in corporate elections posed governance and investor-protection concerns, with most investors unaware of how fund managers vote on their behalf, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson said at an inter-regulatory audience of the Federal Trade Commission. 
""There are serious investor protection and corporate governance issues that are implicated by the common ownership of stocks by a handful of institutional index fund managers,"" Jackson said at the gathering at New York University's School of Law.
""Each year, institutional investors cast votes in corporate elections on behalf of more than 100 million American families, wielding significant power in the future of our companies and communities,"" he added.
Jackson, a Democratic commissioner who was sworn in at the SEC in January, said investors did not get enough useable information about how fund managers vote on matters regarding their money and consequently, they cannot hold those managers accountable for how they vote in those elections.
""It’s time for that to change.""
Jackson's comments are likely to intensify a broader debate over corporate democracy in the United States which has heated up in recent months.
Industry groups are pushing the SEC to overhaul its rules on how shareholders are able to vote on special issues like climate change and diversity, while investors worry any changes will undermine their ability to hold company managers to account.
Citing recent academic research, Jackson, a professor who is on public service leave from the New York University's School of Law, said institutional investor voting patterns fall into three distinct camps and investors ought to be aware of the distinct biases when deciding which funds to park their money with.
Jackson has become a persistent voice for investor protection issues at the regulator, pushing for change on other issues such as voting rights and stock exchange fees and competition.

VANCOUVER/BEIJING (Reuters) - The daughter of Huawei's founder, a top executive at the Chinese technology giant, was arrested in Canada and faces extradition to the United States, stirring up fears it could reignite a Sino-U.S. trade row and roiling global stock markets.
The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, 46, who is Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, threatens to drive a wedge between the United States and China just days after they agreed a 90-day trade war truce in Argentina on Saturday - the day she was detained. 
Meng's arrest, revealed late on Wednesday by Canadian authorities, is related to U.S. sanctions, a person familiar with the matter said. Reuters was unable to determine the precise nature of the possible violations. 
People familiar with the matter told Reuters in April that U.S. authorities have been investigating Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, since at least 2016 for allegedly shipping U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws.
The arrest and any potential sanctions on the world's no. 2 smartphone maker could have major repercussions on the global technology supply chain. 
U.S. and Asian shares tumbled as news of the arrest heightened anxiety over prospects of a collision between the world's two largest economic powers, not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony.
Huawei is not listed, but China's second-largest telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), sank nearly 6 percent in Hong Kong while most of the nearby national bourses lost at least 2 percent.
U.S. stocks also started lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) down 1.16 percent, the S&P 500 (SPX) down 1.35 percent and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) down almost 2 percent at the opening bell.
Investors rushed to the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) back below 2.9 percent to its lowest level in three months.
Huawei is already under intense scrutiny from Washington and other western governments over its ties to the Chinese government, driven by concerns it could be used by Beijing for spying. It has been locked out of the U.S. and some other markets for telecom gear. Huawei has repeatedly insisted Beijing has no influence over it.
Meng, one of the vice chairs on the company's board and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities and a court hearing has been set for Friday, a Canadian Justice Department spokesman said. Trump and Xi had dined in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1 at the G20 summit.
Huawei, which generated $93 billion in revenue last year, confirmed the arrest. ""The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,"" it said in a statement.
She was detained while transferring flights in Canada, it added. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing on Thursday that China had asked Canada and the United States for an explanation of Meng's arrest, but they have “not provided any clarification"".
The Chinese consulate in Vancouver has been providing her assistance, he added, declining further comment. On Wednesday, China's embassy in Canada said it resolutely opposed the arrest and called for her immediate release.
In April, the sources told Reuters the U.S. Justice Department probe was being handled by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn.
The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn also declined to comment.
'EXTREMELY SHOCKING' 
Lu Xiang, an expert on China-U.S. relations at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, called Meng's arrest “extremely shocking.”
""If someone from the United States is hoping to use threats to an individual’s personal safety in order to add weight in the talks, then they have most certainly miscalculated,"" he said.
Arthur Kroeber, founder of Gavekal Dragonomics, said Beijing was unlikely to retaliate against the U.S. business community in China because its interests have partly overlapped with China’s in the trade war, giving Beijing some leverage.
Jia Wenshan, a professor at Chapman University in California, said the arrest ""runs a huge risk of derailing the U.S.-China trade talks.""
While Meng's arrest comes at a delicate time in U.S.-China relations, it was not clear if the timing was coincidental. 
The probe of Huawei is similar to one that threatened the survival of China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), which pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran in efforts to curb Tehran's missile and nuclear programs. 
Earlier this year, the United States banned U.S. firms from selling parts and software to ZTE, which eventually paid $1 billion as part of a deal to get the ban lifted.
Huawei has said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations.
News of the arrest came the same day Britain's BT Group (L:BT) said it was removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations and would not use the Chinese company in central parts of the next network.
In January 2013, Reuters reported that Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator, had much closer ties to Huawei than previously known.
Meng, who also has used the English names Cathy and Sabrina, served on the board of Skycom between February 2008 and April 2009, according to Skycom records and several other past and present Skycom directors appear to have connections to Huawei. 
Meng's arrest drew a quick reaction in Washington.

U.S. Senator Ben Sasse praised the move and said that it was ""for breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran."" He added: ""Sometimes Chinese aggression is explicitly state-sponsored and sometimes it's laundered through many of Beijing's so-called 'private' sector entities.""

The S&P 500 fell 66 points, or 2.47%, as of 11:13 AM ET (16:13 GMT), while the Dow decreased 673 points, or 2.69%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 139 points, or 1.95%.
Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at the Chinese smartphone company Huawei was arrested in Canada on an an extradition request by the U.S. The U.S. has been investigating whether or not she violated sanctions against Iran. China has asked for her immediate release.
The arrest happened just one-week after U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade truce. Investors fear the arrest could derail any potential trade talks between the two countries.
""In general, we all have the same questions we did on Tuesday,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. ""The news on Huawei throws another level of uncertainty on our ability to actually come to some agreement with China.""
A 10-year-high U.S. trade deficit also suggested the Trump administration's tariff-related measures to shrink the trade gap have been ineffective.
All 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Technology stocks were among the hardest hit, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3%, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) falling 0.4% and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dipping 2%. Financial stocks were also down, with the S&P 500 Financials down 3%.

Daimler said the delay means it will not be able to book valuation and earnings gains this year, causing the financial services division's 2018 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to come in significantly below prior year's level.

The valuation gains are now expected to be booked in 2019, Daimler said. The carmaker further said its 2018 full year EBIT forecast on a group level remains unchanged.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron must pursue tax-friendly policies towards foreign investors if he wants French startups to flourish, visiting Silicon Valley investors told Reuters on Thursday.
The visit and associated demands comes at a tough time for the French leader, who faces the fierce opposition of the ""Yellow Vest"" movement over economic reforms, which are seen as favoring the wealthy.
The discreet one-day tour of France's startup scene is the result of two months of intense work by the country's export promotion agency Business France, at the invitation of Macron, who has organized a dinner at the Elysee Palace later on Thursday.
Joe Schoendorf of venture capital group Accel Partners said France had a chance to become the lead player in technology in Europe.
""France will become the innovation center for the new EU, and they will, and they can blow it,"" he told Reuters on a visit to Paris tech campus station F.
""Right now, the game is totally France....Nobody is in your way but don't drop the ball,"" he added. Accel's investments in France include carsharing business BlaBlaCar. 
The French tech scene has seen a boom in recent years, helped by Macron's efforts to develop a ""startup nation"", as a new generation of tech-savvy entrepreneurs taps into the large pool of engineers that France's top universities produce.
WEALTH TAX
France is being pulled in two different directions on tax -- trying to balance wooing business with anger from ordinary citizens over the cost of living. 
A source close to the president's office said France had thought about postponing the session in light of the protests but decided to press ahead. 
The visit coincided with a threat by France to tax digital giants at a national level from next year if European Union states cannot reach an agreement on a tax on digital revenues.
One of the main measures implemented by the French government to boost business and investment after Macron's election last year was to set a flat tax of 30 percent on all capital income and remove the top marginal band of payroll tax.
Macron was this week forced to bring his ministers back into line after his government spokesman and a junior minister said reinstating a scrapped wealth tax was being considered. 
Despite pressure from the street protests, Macron's team is acutely aware that such a tax would deter foreign investors.
""If you want the new jobs, with the high salaries, you gotta compete with the rest of the world for them and wealth tax is one way to be sure you don't get them,"" said Schoendorf.
Tony Fadell, a former member of the iPhone development team who moved to Paris more than three years ago, said the tech sector needed to be nurtured despite Macron's current problems.

""I understand people are suffering and those problems need to be addressed but you can't throw away the future,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has rejected  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) plans to prevent further consumer abuses and told the scandal-plagued lender it needs stronger checks on management, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The concerns raised by the Fed, which have not been previously reported, are likely to increase the time it takes the central bank to lift an asset cap it imposed on Wells Fargo in February following a string of sales practices scandals. 
The bank must draw up a robust plan to improve its governance and risk management controls before the Fed will lift the cap and in February Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was ""on the fast track"" to meeting those conditions.
Both the Fed and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the specifics of the review.
On Thursday, the bank said it was working to satisfy the Fed's concerns and that the process was ongoing.
""We work diligently to address feedback provided,"" the bank said in a statement. ""This is an ongoing, iterative process."" 
In April, Wells Fargo submitted its plan, expecting the Fed to sign off on it over the summer, but the central bank instead told the country's fourth-largest lender to go back to the drawing board, the people said.
The settlement requires Wells Fargo to toughen board oversight, repay customers hurt by past abuses, and make more than 20 other improvements to its governance, risk management and compliance controls.
It also required the plan to be approved, implemented and an independent third-party review completed by Sept. 30, but the bank has missed this deadline, the people said. 
That alone could have triggered further sanctions under the terms of the settlement, but the Fed has granted Wells Fargo more time to satisfy the February order, the sources said.
Wells Fargo executives and Fed officials have haggled for months over what controls are needed to make sure the bank can detect problems before they become full-blown scandals, the people said.
On Tuesday, bank CEO Sloan told CNBC that the bank now expects the cap will be lifted in the first half of 2019, instead of this fall. He added that discussions with the Fed regarding the operational and risk compliance aspects of the plan were ongoing.
""I'm optimistic that we'll continue to make progress, but we need to demonstrate that we're deserving of the asset cap being lifted,"" Sloan said.
The bank told investors in May that it expected the asset cap to hurt profits by only $100 million. 
Over the past nine months, Sloan has met several times with Fed Governor Lael Brainard to try and agree on the specifics of the new plan, said two sources. Betsy Duke, a former Fed governor who now sits on the Wells Fargo board, has joined Sloan in those meetings, they added. 
Reuters could not ascertain how close the two parties were to an agreement. However, even if the Fed blesses Wells Fargo's plan before year-end, the settlement still requires the bank to hire outside firms to perform an independent review of the bank's operations - work that is expected to take months. 

In May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said removal of the cap would also be put to a vote of the board of governors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's (O:FB) losses are becoming other companies' gains. 
Concerns about the social media giant's declining profit margins and battered reputation have prompted 93 U.S. mutual funds to completely sell out of their positions in the company so far this year, exacerbating a roughly 35 percent decline in Facebook's share price from its highs, according to Refinitiv’s Lipper research service. 
The selling by fund firms including Fidelity Investments, The Hartford and Putnam Investments combined for a total of nearly 12 million shares, and came amid similar moves to liquidate positions in the company by prominent growth-focused hedge funds. Jana Partners and Third Point LLC, for instance, together sold nearly 3.7 million Facebook shares in the third quarter, according to securities filings. 
Funds that have dumped Facebook, whose shares helped lead the broad U.S. market higher the last two years, are now favoring investments ranging from payments companies like  Visa Inc  (N:V) and Worldpay Inc (N:WP) to consumer companies including PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) and Chef's Warehouse Inc (O:CHEF) because they expect the troubles at the social media company to continue as it leaves its era of rapid growth behind.
Facebook was rocked by disclosures earlier this year that the personal information of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shares with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
""The revelations in the first quarter of 2018 about data privacy issues and the growing global concerns about data security and the potential for increased regulation made it challenging to handicap the required investments to remedy some of these issues, which we anticipated would weigh meaningfully on earnings growth in coming quarters,"" said Jim Hamel, portfolio manager of the Artisan Global Opportunities Fund (O:ARTRX).
Hamel's fund, which liquidated its position in May, reaped a nearly 400 percent gain on Facebook after buying during its initial public offering in May 2012, which was priced at $38 a share. Hamel said he has used the gains to add to positions in the fast-growing global digital payments industry such as Worldpay, whose shares are up 12 percent for the year to date. 
Greg Woodard, managing director at Manning & Napier, said his firm, which began buying Facebook in November 2012 at around $20 per share, sold all its Facebook shares this year as part of a broad move away from cyclical technology companies.
Facebook's ""most recent guidance really substantiated the margin contraction that we had started to worry about, and when we looked at the price and our future growth expectations they didn't match up with what the market was forecasting,"" he said.
Woodard said his firm has added positions in software developer EPam Systems Inc (N:EPAM) and global beverage company PepsiCo, and has been adding to its position in Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on dips.
""BROKEN"" STOCK? 
While Facebook is now trading at a more compelling valuation following the steep declines in its share price, questions about its ability to maintain and accelerate its growth rate may leave Facebook in a no-man's land between a growth stock that appeals to investors focused on rapid expansion and a value stock that appeals to investors looking for companies that trade at a discount or offer attractive dividends. 
""Once a company gets put into the penalty box by a growth investor it's hard to get out,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA. ""When a stock is perceived as a broken growth stock it loses its appeal, whereas a declining stock price for a value stock can often make it more appealing."" 
Woodard, the Manning & Napier fund manager, said his firm would not purchase shares of Facebook again in its growth strategies, and instead would put the company into a fund that focuses on ""companies that need to fix themselves"" if he were to buy it again. 

For that to happen, Facebook's stock price would need to be ""significantly lower,"" he said. ""The gap is not worth putting a number on it.""

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>",Italy's ruling parties at odds over taxing high-emission cars,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling parties were at odds on Thursday over an amendment to the 2019 budget law, introduced this week, that would raise taxes on traditional fossil-fueled cars.
Late on Tuesday, Italy's Lower House Budget Committee approved subsidies of up to 6,000 euros ($6,804) for those who buy low-emission vehicles, but at the same time it added a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros on sales of petrol and diesel cars.
The new rules had been encouraged by Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement, a pro-environment party, but on Thursday its coalition partner slammed the planned tax increase. 
""I'm absolutely against any new tax on cars, which are already among the most taxed in the whole of Europe,"" League party leader Matteo Salvini said in an interview with Radio Rai1, adding that people who turned to more polluting models did so out of necessity, not choice. 
Before forming the government together in June and having a common policy platform, dubbed as ""the contract with Italians"", the two parties were rivals and they run separately at local elections. 
They have been at loggerheads several times since taking power, including over other measures 5-Star opposes in part for environmental concerns, such as the Franco-Italian high-speed rail link, which the League backs. 
Luigi Di Maio, also deputy prime minister and leader of the 5-Star, replied to Salvini, saying the government would improve the measures. 
""We do not want to harm families in difficulty .. who pick the cheapest car, nor do we want to create a shock to the Italian car market, to manufacturers or their workers,"" Di Maio said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Changes to the amendment would be agreed with consumer associations, sector trade unions, and car producers, he said. 
Electric, hybrid and methane gas-powered cars made up 7 percent of Italy's car sales last month, according to data provided by foreign car manufacturers association UNRAE.
However, Italy's main car manufacturer  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) does not sell any electric and hybrid cars at present in Europe.
The expansionary budget - contested by Brussels for not respecting European rules - is currently being discussed by parliament and is due to receive a final green light by the end of the year.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's Lion Air is considering cancelling orders for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets following a crash that killed 189 people in October but has not yet made a decision, the airline's CEO Edward Sirait said on Thursday.
Sirait told a briefing that Lion Air was examining the legality of cancelling orders but had not yet communicated with the manufacturer about the prospect.
The airline has 190 Boeing jets worth $22 billion at list prices waiting to be delivered, on top of 197 already taken, making it one of the largest U.S. export customers.
Reuters on Monday reported Lion Air was reviewing Boeing airplane purchases and had not ruled out cancelling orders as relations worsen in a spat over responsibility for the crash, according to sources.
Any cancellation of orders would need to be approved by the airline's co-founders and co-owners, Rusdi Kirana and his brother Kusnan Kirana.
Rusdi Kirana ordered a review of airline purchases in response to Boeing's statement last week focusing attention on piloting and maintenance topics related to the crash, Reuters reported on Monday.
Boeing declined to comment on contractual matters but industry sources say aerospace companies rarely leave room for unilateral cancellations except in exceptional circumstances.
Bankers and some analysts say Lion Air and Southeast Asian rivals over-expanded and would be comfortable with fewer orders.
Lion Air, as a private company, does not publicly disclose information about its financial position. 
Loss-making national carrier Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) has reported pressure from higher oil prices and a weaker currency.

The cash-strapped firm said this week it wants the government to take on 100 billion rand of its debts, about a quarter of its total borrowings. It is also eyeing a steep hike in tariffs in 2019 from the energy regulator.
""That's an issue that is being discussed in government and some time in the New Year government as a whole will give you some idea of where we are going,"" Gordhan told reporters referring to the firm's debt of over 400 billion rand ($28 billion).
The idea of moving Eskom's debt on to government's balance sheet has unnerved investors as it puts even more pressure on South Africa's sovereign credit ratings, already rated subinvestment by two of the top three agencies.
""It's work in progress. We're dealing with 400 billion rand of debt and its not something you can deal with easily, Gordhan said. ""You can't deal with just the debt issue without looking at the organizational way forward as well.""
Gordhan said there was ""no possibility of haircuts on Eskom debt.
""What we are talking about is how do we address our responsibility to pay back the money that has been borrowed ... and provide the confidence that will be done,"" said Gordhan.
Africa's biggest economy has experienced a week of nationwide power outages, which Eskom has blamed on low coal supplies as well as maintenance to its aging fleet of stations.

1018,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>",Walgreens is teaming up with FedEx to defend its turf from Amazon and CVS,"Walgreens is getting deeper into the prescription-delivery wars. 
On Thursday, the pharmacy giant said it partnered with FedEx to do national, next-day prescription delivery. At the start, the service will be available at 7,100 of Walgreens' 9,560 pharmacies. Same-day delivery is available in Dallas, Chicago, New York City, Gainesville, Miami, Tampa, and Fort Lauderdale. 
Walgreens is up against stiff competition for customers, facing off against  Amazon, which is getting into the pharmacy business through its acquisition of the online pharmacy PillPack;  CVS Health, which is making a big bet on the healthcare aspect of its business through the acquisition of the insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET); and of course the retail giant  Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Next-day delivery will cost customers $4.99. A Walgreens spokesman said same-day delivery fees will vary, but will be priced competitively. In the past, Walgreens has offered delivery, though typically not as quickly. It's also had a relationship with FedEx in which Walgreens set up counters in its stores where customers can drop off and pick up packages.
Customers who opt into getting texts from Walgreens will get an alert when a prescription is ready, and then can decide to have it delivered instead of coming into the store.

CVS Health is taking a similar approach. In June, CVS said it would offer next-day delivery, with pharmacies in some cities like New York and San Francisco providing a same-day delivery service. One-to-two day service,  CVS said, would cost $4.99, while same-day costs $8.99. 
The move came right before Amazon  acquired PillPack. PillPack mails prescriptions that are packaged together based on when they need to be taken, putting it in a good spot to handle prescriptions for elderly people who tend to have more prescriptions. "
1019,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:15AM ET</span>",Lyft officially files paperwork for an IPO," Lyft has officially filed paperwork with the top US stock market regulator to go public, the ride-hailing giant  announced Thursday morning.
The confidential draft registration statement, submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is the first step to an initial public offering, or IPO, for Lyft.
It's a big step in what's largely considered to be a race to go public between Lyft and its much larger rival Uber. The latter is also considering an IPO next year, but has been coy about the timing of its float. 
Lyft did not elaborate on pricing, number of shares, or targeted valuation. Those specifics will come after the SEC completes its review. The actual offering will likely come in early 2019. The company was most recently valued at $15 billion, and a public offering could boost that number. 
A Lyft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. 
The company  began lining up banks as recently as October, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) assisting with the deal. Other firms reported to be involved are JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Jefferies. 
Not content with its roughly 35% market share in the US, Lyft has also been branching beyond traditional ride-hailing as it seeks further growth. Last week, it's  acquisition of Motivate, the country's largest bike share operator, officially closed. The purchase adds bikes and scooters in most major cities to its arsenal, now known as Lyft Bikes.
 Uber, still far-and-away the largest ride-hailing company in the world, is also working towards an IPO next year. It's potential valuation could easily overshadow Lyft's offering,  with a reported target of $120 billion.
Unlike Lyft, Uber has self-reported quarterly financials. Most recently, those numbers showed slowing growth and widening losses for the company.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:13AM ET</span>",Noble Group's $3.5 billion restructuring at risk as authorities block new listing,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group’s (SI:NOBG) $3.5 billion debt rescue plan was thrown into doubt on Thursday when Singapore authorities said they would block the re-listing of shares in what was once Asia’s top commodity trader.
Singapore regulators took the decision after reviewing the findings so far of a probe into Singapore-listed Noble by Singapore police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).
The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's central bank, and Singapore Exchange regulators concluded that ""there are significant uncertainties about the financial position of New Noble,"" they said in a statement, referring to the restructured unit.
""It would be imprudent to allow the re-listing as investors will not be able to trade in New Noble's shares on an informed basis. MAS and SGX Regco (Singapore Exchange Regulation) will therefore not allow the re-listing of New Noble to proceed,"" the statement said.
Noble has seen its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion over the past four years after its accounting was questioned by Iceberg Research in February 2015.
To save itself, Noble has sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs, while defending its accounting.
The company, whose shares were suspended from trading last month due to the restructuring, wants to transform itself into an Asia-focused coal-trading business. Noble was looking to list the overhauled business as part of the restructuring, which is subject to regulatory approval,
Noble had no immediate comment on the decision but it has previously warned that as part of an alternative restructuring plan, it would seek insolvency protection in Britain if the primary restructuring was not completed.
Amid the regulatory probe, Noble had pushed back last month's deadline to complete its debt restructuring deal to Dec. 11 and said it was cooperating fully with authorities.
At the time of the last extension, Noble had said it had made good progress towards completing the restructuring but the timeline was delayed ""due to the additional time required to fully address all concerns of the regulators.""
On Thursday, Singapore authorities said that after the investigation started, Noble had submitted financial statements which would have cut the restructured unit's net asset value by as much as 45 percent after taking into account potential non-compliance with accounting standards.
Under the proposed debt-for-equity deal, Noble's debt will be halved and it will get access to $800 million in trade finance and hedging facilities, a lifeline in a sector where profit margins are in the low single digits.

In return, Noble's creditors, mostly made up of hedge funds, are to own 70 percent of the restructured business, while existing shareholders' equity would be reduced to 20 percent and Noble's management was to get 10 percent.

The company's shares fell nearly 3 percent to $27.80 in premarket trading. 
Kroger has warned that the remodeling will weigh on sales this year as customers find it harder to locate groceries, but will help drive revenue in the long run. 
The company said same-store sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6 percent. Analysts on average had expected a 1.65 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding fuel and a charge related to inventory valuation, Kroger's gross profit margin fell 91 basis points to 21.6 percent due to price cuts and higher transportation costs. 
The Cincinnati-based company said net income attributable to Kroger fell to $317 million, or 39 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 10, from $397 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Total sales fell 0.3 percent to $27.67 billion, but came in marginally above average estimate of $27.66 billion.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 08:25AM ET</span>",Shell reviews deals involving ex-executive accused of bribery,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) has concluded that a Nigerian oilfield sale where it suspects an executive took bribes was not linked to a separate court case in which he and Shell face corruption charges over a $1.1 billion offshore acquisition.
The Anglo-Dutch company filed a criminal complaint in March against Peter Robinson, a former vice president for sub-Saharan Africa, saying he took bribes in the $390 million sale of onshore Oil Mining Lease (OML) 42 to a Nigerian firm.
Robinson is also one of several former Shell employees involved in a trial in Milan, in which Shell and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) are accused of corruption related to the $1.1 billion purchase of a giant Nigerian offshore field, Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245.
Both the OML 42 and OPL 245 deals were signed in 2011.
Shell, the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, said in a statement to Reuters that it had completed an internal review of the OML 42 sale process and other deals Robinson was involved in, and it concluded his only violation was related to OML 42.
Shell, Eni and Robinson deny any wrongdoing in the OPL 245 case. Robinson also denies any wrongdoing in the OML 42 sale.
Regarding the OML 42 sale, Shell said: ""We have found no evidence to suggest that this was anything other than an isolated breach by a former employee, operating deliberately outside of Shell systems or controls.""
""We have also found no evidence of a connection between Robinson's actions on OML 42 and OPL 245, and we have reconfirmed this to the Dutch Public Prosecutor,"" Shell said.
Shell filed its complaint against Robinson to the Dutch prosecutor.
The Dutch prosecutor's officer confirmed on Thursday it had received further information from Shell but offered no additional comment, saying it was still evaluating all the information and determining next steps.
Robinson's lawyer Chiara Padovani said her client ""denies any allegations of criminal misconduct in connection with OML 42."" She also said Robinson ""agrees with Shell's conclusion that the sale of OML 42 is unrelated to OPL 245."" 
A source told Reuters in March that documents related to the OML 42 case had been uncovered after investigators looking into OPL 245 raided a house in Perth, Australia owned by Robinson.
Milan prosecutors allege bribes totaling about $1.1 billion were paid, including to middlemen, to win the OPL 245 deal for Shell and Eni.
Shell has said it expects the case in Italy to last many months.

1025,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>","Huawei’s CFO Arrested at U.S. Request, Sparking Outrage in China","(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer was arrested in Canada over potential violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran, provoking outrage from China and complicating thorny trade negotiations just as they enter a critical juncture.
Wanzhou Meng — also deputy chairwoman and the daughter of Huawei’s founder — faces extradition to the U.S., said Ian McLeod, a Canada Justice Department spokesman, declining to elaborate. She was arrested Dec. 1 after the U.S. Department of Justice in April opened an investigation into whether the leading telecommunications-equipment maker sold gear to Iran despite sanctions on exports to the region.
News of Meng’s arrest provoked strong protest from the Chinese embassy in Canada, which called it a violation of its citizens’ rights while demanding the U.S. and its neighbor “rectify wrongdoings” and free Meng. Her arrest is sure to heighten tensions between Washington and Beijing days after the world’s two largest economies agreed on a truce in their growing trade conflict. Meng’s father Ren Zhengfei, a former army engineer, has won acclaim at home for toppling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). in smartphones and turning an electronics reseller into a producer of networking gear with revenue surpassing Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. He’s regularly named among China’s top executives, and was among 100 business leaders honored for their contributions as the country celebrates the 40th anniversary of opening its economy. His stature at home is roughly comparable to Bill Gates or Michael Dell in the U.S.
The CFO’s arrest -- the same day Donald Trump and Xi Jinping dined in Buenos Aires --- is likely to be regarded back home as an attack on one of China’s foremost corporate champions. While  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. dominate headlines thanks to flashy growth and high-profile billionaire founders, Ren’s company is by far China’s most global technology company, with operations spanning Africa, Europe and Asia.
U.S. equity futures and Asian stocks slid as Meng’s arrest re-ignited concerns about U.S.-Chinese tensions. At a regularly scheduled press briefing on Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China wanted the U.S. and Canada “to clarify the grounds for the detention, to release the detainee and earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the person involved.”
Huawei’s ambitions now range from artificial intelligence and chipmaking to fifth-generation wireless. That last effort, a massive push into the future of mobile and internet communications, has raised hackles in the U.S. and become a focal point for American attempts to contain China’s ascendancy. Shares in several of its suppliers, from Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. and Largan Precision Co. to MediaTek Inc., fell.
“Tencent and Alibaba may be domestic champions and huge platforms in of their own rights, but Huawei has become a global powerhouse,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities Ltd. It is “5G standards that are at the heart of the wider IP debate and why the U.S. and her allies are now doing everything they can to cut to the heart of the Chinese technology IP revolution.”
Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper first reported the arrest, about which the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referred questions to his country’s own justice department. Huawei said the arrest was made on behalf of the U.S. so Meng could be extradited to “face unspecified charges” in the Eastern District of New York.
“The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,” it said in a statement. “The company believes the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion. Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, U.S. and EU.”
In targeting Huawei, the U.S. is threatening one of the companies at the heart of Xi’s long-term campaign to wrest the lead in future technologies and wean China off a reliance on foreign expertise.
Once a purveyor of unremarkable telecommunications equipment, Huawei’s now No. 2 in smartphone shipments and is shooting for the lead in fifth-generation wireless networks while preparing to take on some of America’s biggest chipmakers. It’s already by some reckonings the world’s largest provider of networking equipment to wireless carriers, outstripping the likes of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB with growing sales in Europe. It’s declared its intention to surpass Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. in phones as well. The company is targeting record sales of $102.2 billion this year.
Trump’s administration this year invoked its name in blocking a Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.-Broadcom Inc. merger that would’ve been the largest deal ever, saying it would hand the lead in 5G to China. But as far back as 2016, the Commerce Department had sought information regarding whether Huawei was possibly sending U.S. technology to Syria and North Korea as well as Iran. The U.S. previously banned ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., a Huawei competitor, for violating a sanctions settlement over transactions with Iran and North Korea. That moratorium -- since lifted -- drove ZTE to the brink of collapse.
U.S. authorities in 2016 also began voicing concerns that Huawei and others could install back doors in their equipment that would let them monitor users in the U.S., something Huawei has denied.
Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said Wednesday night that Huawei and ZTE “are two sides of the same coin – Chinese telecommunications companies that represent a fundamental risk to American national security.”
“While the Commerce Department focused its attention on ZTE, this news highlights that Huawei is also violating U.S. Law,” Van Hollen said in a statement.
It’s unclear whether Meng’s arrest could trigger the same sort of sanctions that ZTE incurred. Such a move would be far more significant given Huawei’s heft.
In August, Trump signed a bill banning the government’s use of Huawei technology based on the security concerns and U.S. allies are either imposing or considering similar moves. That same month, Australia barred the use of Huawei’s equipment for 5G networks in the country and New Zealand last week did the same, citing national security concerns. The U.K. is currently debating whether to follow suit. In November, Huawei said moves against it would hinder the development of 5G in the U.S. and raise prices for consumers.
“This is what you call playing hard ball,” said Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. “China is already asking for her release, as can be expected, but if the charges are serious, don’t expect the US to blink.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) trading desk was not buying what U.S. President Donald Trump was selling this week.
On Tuesday, major stock indexes plummeted more than 3 percent on renewed fears of a trade war with China — just days after Trump tweeted, following a steak dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping, that ""Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!""
""It doesn't seem like anything was actually agreed to at the dinner,"" JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients later that day, adding that Trump's tweets ""seem if not completely fabricated then grossly exaggerated.""
The mistrust from the bank's trading desk highlights a broader dilemma for Wall Street investors: how seriously to take comments from the White House. 
On one hand, traders have long known that President Trump’s bold pronouncements do not always hold, ultimately muting their effect on securities. On the other hand, market volatility has picked up in 2018, in part because of confusion over comments by Washington officials, making them harder to ignore. 
""It’s a judgment call about which announcements should be taken seriously,"" said Maria Vassalou, portfolio manager for Perella Weinberg Partners’ $685 million global macro strategy.
""This situation certainly creates unnecessary volatility and complications to the investment process.""

It is not just Trump. Unexpected comments from White House officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow have caused a stir with traders. Each man was cited by Reuters as a driver of market moves more than two dozen times.
Mnuchin sent the U.S. dollar to a three-year low in late January after comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos suggesting that a weaker currency was ""good for us.""

As for Kudlow, on April 4 he told reporters that it was possible the U.S. tariffs on Chinese industrial products might never go into effect and may be simply a negotiating tactic. Stocks rose after the remarks, which an unnamed White House official later told Reuters were meant to reassure markets.
Yet equity futures fell the next day after Trump said in a statement that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of imports from China to punish them for retaliating against earlier announced tariffs.

HEDGING TRUMP
Some investors have taken protection from White House-fueled volatility into their own hands.
Juan Gomez, head of hedge fund firm Black Swan Quantitative Advisors which manages $75 million in assets, said he has adjusted his options-focused models over the last two years to incorporate more protection against market volatility, partially in response to Trump administration comments. 
“At this point you are expecting controversial headlines,” Gomez said. “At the beginning, it drove me crazy, but now it’s just part of what to expect.”
Katina Stefanova, head of Marto Capital LP which manages approximately $300 million, said her hedge fund firm had created a “Trumponomics” index of securities to help hedge the broader portfolio. 
Stefanova said her fund’s profit this year – up about 7 percent in 2018 through November - would be around two percentage points lower without the index, which has recently focused on impacts of U.S. trade wars, such as Chinese technology stocks, U.S. industrial companies and Asian currencies.
“You still have to take the White House very seriously,” Stefanova said. “Inconsistency itself swings markets and affects sentiment.”
Other investors simply try to look past White House headlines.
Daniel Lowen, chairman of Quantedge Capital USA Inc, said his approximately $1.5 billion hedge fund firm’s algorithms do not try to anticipate market movements from Trump administration pronouncements. “We make no attempt to interpret what we read in the news as input to our investment decisions,” Lowen said.
The head of equities at a multi-billion-dollar hedge fund manager, who requested anonymity in order to speak with the media, said Trump’s comments are “impossible to ignore” but the firm avoids reactive trading even if it can hurt in the short term. “We try and actually isolate our returns from market risk,” the person said. 
Whatever the reaction, professional investors said the White House's effect on markets is hard to avoid. Securities are virtually certain to continue moving on statements related to U.S. trade policy, interest rate changes and other economic issues. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), a common measure of perceived fear in the markets, is up nearly 90 percent this year.

“Maybe some people are good at parsing their words and figuring out what's what, but that's very difficult,” said Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist, 3EDGE Asset Management LP, which oversees approximately $800 million. “You have to look at what they do and not what they say.""

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",EU sends ultimatum to Switzerland on stock exchanges,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union executive will offer Swiss stock exchanges a two-year extension of their right to operate in the bloc if the Swiss government approves an overall deal on future relations on Friday, EU sources told Reuters.
If Switzerland does not back the draft pact, however, the European Commission will not extend the recognition of the SIX Swiss Exchange - the country's main stock exchange - and other trading venues beyond this year, EU sources said following a meeting of EU diplomats on the issue on Wednesday.
The Swiss cabinet is expected to decide on Friday on whether to back the draft agreement reached with the Commission on future bilateral ties.
""It's deal time. Playing for time wouldn't change anything. The draft will not be changed anymore,"" an EU official said.
Under the draft deal, which would govern EU-Swiss relations currently regulated by about 120 accords by sector, Switzerland would automatically adapt its migration and social security rules to changes in EU legislation, EU diplomats said.
The EU wants the overall framework agreement before it extends recognition of Swiss exchanges beyond the end of this year, when it will otherwise expire. 
Financial operators from countries that are not members of the EU can operate in the bloc under a so-called ""equivalence"" regime which recognizes that foreign-country market rules are compatible with EU legislation.
This regime, which would also concern British firms after Britain leaves the bloc, is granted for limited periods and could be suspended by the EU anytime if significant changes are made in foreign rules.
The SIX bourse has repeatedly warned that it risked losing much of its exchange business if no EU-Swiss deal was reached by the end of the year on future relations.
Switzerland has been for decades integrated in the EU market but is not a member of the 28-country bloc.
DEAL?
But the chances of a deal remain slim.
Political sources in Switzerland said the Swiss cabinet does not have a majority to press ahead with a treaty deal.
A Swiss government spokesman declined to comment, adding it ""will inform the public after having taken its decisions"".
EU officials also recognized that Friday's cabinet meeting might not be definitive, but they insisted that there will not be a new offer from Brussels.
EU states supported the Commission's stance, an EU official said.
A Commission spokesman declined to comment.
Under the draft deal currently on the Swiss government's table, an arbitration tribunal would resolve bilateral disputes but the European Court of Justice would have the final say on matters concerning the application of EU laws, diplomats said.

The Swiss would also contribute to the EU budget and provide financial support to poorer regions in the EU in a way that is proportional to the benefits the Alpine country draws from having unhindered access to the EU market.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court to hear arguments to stop AT&T purchase of Time-Warner,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department goes before an appeals court on Thursday to urge a three-judge panel to overturn a lower court ruling and order wireless carrier AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) to undo its $85.4 billion purchase of entertainment company Time Warner, one of the largest media mergers ever.
The deal was seen as a turning point for an industry upended by companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which go directly to consumers online rather than via pay TV providers like AT&T's DirecTV. 
The deal was significant for two other reasons. First, President Donald Trump, who has famously tangled with Time Warner's CNN, has vociferously opposed the deal. Second, it's a rare instance of the government seeking to stop a merger of a distributor and a supplier, a so-called ""vertical merger.""
The Justice Department filed its lawsuit to stop the deal in November 2017, arguing that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content, like CNN and HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and increasing consumers' cable bills.
The government estimated costs to industry rivals, such as  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR), would increase by $580 million a year if AT&T owned Time Warner.
AT&T, the No.2 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, denied that prices would go up and argued that the purchase of Time Warner would give it information about viewers needed to better compete in the changing entertainment marketplace and allow it to target digital advertising, much like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google already do.
In a scathing opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon concluded that the government had failed to prove its case. 
The argument to overturn Judge Leon's decision will be heard by Judges Judith Rogers, a Clinton nominee, Robert Wilkins, nominated by President Barack Obama, and David Sentelle, named to the bench by President Ronald Reagan.
Although the merger closed on June 14, shortly after Leon's opinion, AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.
AT&T said in October that was preparing to launch a subscription video service by the end of 2019 that will offer movies and TV shows from Hollywood's biggest library, including films like ""Casablanca,"" as well as licensed programming from other companies and, within a year, original content, a top executive told Reuters.

The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal in the global telecom, media and entertainment sector, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 07:12AM ET</span>",European stocks slump to two-year low after China executive arrest,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets slumped for a third day running on Thursday as the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei in Canada for extradition to the United States fed fears of fresh tensions between the two economic superpowers.
The arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhouof, who is also the daughter of the firm's founder, triggered renewed fireworks coming just as Washington and Beijing prepare for crucial trade negotiations.
Asian markets took a beating. Huawei is not listed but China's second-largest telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763) sank 9 percent in Hong Kong while most of the nearby national bourses lost at least 2 percent. 
Europe slumped too in early trading as 3 percent falls for the tech sector, miners and also carmakers kicked London, Frankfurt and Paris to two-year lows.
""We had this very ugly new turn and just the degree to which the market has reacted just suggests to me that they are vulnerable right now,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy.
""It think we should all be very careful, it is not looking good, especially if the S&P 500 goes to new lows.""
Hardy said that U.S. President Donald Trump may try to send some reassuring tweets later. For the time being though S&P 500 futures were down almost 2 percent.
The losses might have been even steeper had CME Group's Chicago Mercantile Exchange not implemented a series of 10-second trading halts in Asia that had limited the initial drop.
Japan's Nikkei shed 1.9 percent, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 30, with semi-conductor related shares leading the losses. Huawei is one of the world's largest makers of smartphones and telecommunications network equipment.
MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific index lost 2.0 percent too. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2.5 percent while Chinese bluechips lost 2.1 percent to take their 2018 slump to 20 percent.
GROGGY AUSSIE 
Saxo Bank's Hardy highlighted that the Australian dollar, which is highly sensitive to trade tensions due to huge Aussie metals sales to China, had failed to lift after some reassuring comments from Beijing on the trade discussions.
It shed 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar to $0.7229. The greenback itself fell as much 0.4 percent against the yen to 112.77 yen as it suffered slightly too.
The yuan eased 0.3 percent to 6.8835 per dollar in offshore trade, the euro barely budged at $1.1338 and the Canadian dollar languished near the 18-month low it had hit the previous day after cautious noises from the Bank of Canada.
On the Huawei drama, Canadian authorities had said they had arrested the firm's CFO in Vancouver.
China's foreign ministry said neither Canada and the United States had clarified their reason for the move but a source had earlier told Reuters it was related to violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
The arrest heightened the sense of a major collision between the world's two largest economic powers not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony.
Britain's BT Group (LON:BT) said it was removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations. Australia and New Zealand have also rejected Huawei's products.
""The U.S. has been telling its allies not to use Huawei products for security reasons and is likely to continue to put pressure on its allies,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""So while there was a brief moment of optimism after the weekend U.S.-China talks but the reality is, it won't be that easy,"" he said.
OPEC
Traders were also waiting to hear from Vienna about what kind of cuts OPEC and other oil producers like Russia could make to their output.
Consensus among analysts is for somewhere between 1-1.3 million barrels per day, and Brent dived back below $60 a barrel as Saudi Arabia's energy minister said going into the day long meeting that 1 million ""would be enough""
Yields on top-rated German government bonds held near six-month lows in risk off environment, while those on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were near a three-month low at 2.886 percent. 
Adding to worries about U.S. recession risks, the Treasury yield curve remained inverted between two- and five-year zones, with five-year notes yielding 2.763 percent, below 2.778 percent on two-year notes. 

U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any sign of serious weakness, markets are likely to react HSBC's head of macro economic strategy, Shuji Shirota, said.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>",Volkswagen to cut another $3.4 billion in costs to boost margins,"By Jan Schwartz and Edward Taylor
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) announced another 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of cost cuts on Thursday in an effort to speed up an improvement in profit margins at its core VW brand.
Still battling to recover from a 2015 scandal over emissions test cheating, the German automaker has been cutting costs to fund an ambitious shift to electric cars and automated driving. 
A key goal is to improve margins at its mass-market VW brand, its largest division by sales, but which has long lagged the profitability of rivals such as Japan's Toyota due in part to high labor costs at its German plants.
""By 2020 we will achieve three billion euros in cost savings, and now aim for a further three billion euros by 2023,"" Arno Antlitz, the board member responsible for finance at the VW brand, told a press conference in Wolfsburg, Germany. 
That should help the brand reach a profit margin of at least six percent by 2022, three years earlier than previously planned, the company added. 
Volkswagen said it aimed to reduce administrative expenses and take out complexity out of the brand's model line-up, while also striving to raise the productivity of its plants by about 30 percent by 2025. 
The company did not give any details about job cuts, but ruled out forced redundancies. It said VW had started talks with labor leaders about the plan and discussions were constructive.
The VW brand aims to invest more than 11 billion euros in electric vehicles, digitalization, autonomous driving and mobility services by 2023, with the bulk earmarked for electric cars, the company said.
Volkswagen also said talks over a potential alliance with U.S. rival Ford were going well, and that it would give an update at the beginning of 2019. The firms are exploring areas of potential cooperation including electric and autonomous cars.
Shares in Volkswagen, which also makes Audi, Porsche, Skoda and Seat cars, were down 2.1 percent at 1120 GMT, in line with a European autos index hit by worries over a fresh build-up in the Sino-U.S. trade war.

The operator estimated it will need to ask the government to make this extra investment available up to 2023 to keep the 33,000 kilometre grid in shape, the documents showed.
It comes on top of nearly 28 billion euros government investment already earmarked to be spent on the network between 2019 and 2023.
Requirements would become especially urgent after 2020, ""in order to combat further aging and to ensure the investment backlog does not grow further,"" it said.
The network is key to a drive by the Bahn to reduce delays and cancellations to improve customer satisfaction and help draw transport volumes away from other sectors to rail, in order to cut harmful emissions from fuel burning.
A spokesman for the Bahn declined to comment on the figures.
The state has to bear transport infrastructure costs, but demands assurances that the network operator will make optimal and transparent use of the funds to actually achieve the promised improvements.

Unlike Tuesday, two-year notes drove gains as stocks, led by the technology sector, looked to resume their slide following the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer over potential violations of sanctions on Iran.
The rally in bonds took the yield on two-year securities down to the lowest level in almost three months. That meant the difference between two- and 10-year U.S. bonds widened to 13 basis points, the first steepening in five trading days.
A section of the U.S. yield curve inverted last week for the first time in 11 years, sending jitters through financial markets across the world as investors worried about the possibility of a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy.
“The expectations of further turmoil in equities and widening in credit is serving to support Treasuries,” said Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International Plc. “The main support for USTs being at the front end highlights that investors are comfortable in positioning contrary to what the Fed has been guiding the market to expect.”

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Arrest of Huawei 'heiress' throws rare spotlight on family,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Like many top Chinese executives, Meng Wanzhou is a mysterious figure even in her home country, but the 46-year-old chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies had been widely tipped to one day take the helm of the tech giant her father founded.
That was until her shock arrest in Canada at the request of U.S. authorities on Wednesday, a move that has entangled her in the protracted diplomatic tensions between Washington and Beijing. Her fate is now uncertain.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the arrest stems from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] alleged violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Similar allegations of breaching U.S. export restrictions led to rival Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763) being hit with a devastating ban and heavy fines this year.
Huawei said in a statement that it had been provided with little information ""about the charges"" against Meng, who is also one of the vice chairs of its board and the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei from his first marriage. Huawei added that it was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng"".
The detention of Meng, who takes her family name from her mother and has also used the English first names ""Cathy"" and ""Sabrina"", has once again thrown the spotlight on Huawei at a time of heightened global concerns over electronic security.
Much of the scrutiny stems from Ren's background with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), where he worked as a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983, after helping to build its communications network.
Officials in some governments, particularly the United States, have voiced concern that his company is close to the Chinese military and government. Huawei has repeatedly insisted Beijing has no influence over it.
LOW PROFILE
Ren, 74, founded the Chinese telecommunications company in 1988 and, like his elder daughter, has largely kept a low profile.
But in a rare move, he posed last month for a family photoshoot for French lifestyle magazine Paris Match with his younger daughter and current wife.
Annabel Yao, 20, Meng's half-sister, posed in front of a grand piano with her mother, identified by the magazine as Yao Ling, and Ren, who wore a blue shirt with his hand resting on his smiling daughter's shoulder.
A Huawei spokesman confirmed to Reuters that Yao is Ren's wife. Few outsiders had previously heard of the younger daughter, a Harvard computer science student and ballerina. She recently made a high-profile appearance at the exclusive Le Bal Debutante ball in Paris.
Huawei is privately held and describes itself as employee-owned. Though Ren owns only around 1.4 percent of the shares, employees say he has supreme leadership within the company, frequently communicating to staff scattered throughout the world via internal memos.
Huawei, now China's largest technology company by employees, with more than 180,000 staff and revenue of $93 billion in 2017, started off selling digital telephone switches in the 1990s.
It won its first big overseas contract for fixed-line network products from Hong Kong's Hutchison-Whampoa in 1996. Today, Huawei's domestic and overseas revenue are equally split, according to the 2017 annual report.
Huawei derives around half of its revenue from supplying equipment to telecoms carriers around the world. It has overtaken Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) to be the world's largest telecoms equipment maker by revenue.
Smartphones have become another key business in recent years, pitting it against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) in the highly competitive market.
HEIR APPARENT
According to Huawei's website, Meng joined the company in 1993, obtained a master's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1998, and rose up the ranks over the years, mostly holding financial roles.
She has held the positions of director of the international accounting department, CFO of Huawei Hong Kong, and president of the accounting management department, according to the website.
In her first media appearance before the Chinese press in 2013, Meng said she had first joined the company as a secretary ""whose job was just to take calls"".
She also said she was married with a son and a daughter and that her husband did not work in the industry, dismissing speculation she was married to a senior Huawei executive.
Meng's importance at Huawei became apparent in 2011, when she was first named as a board member. Company insiders describe her as capable and hardworking.
While her brother, Meng Ping, as well as her father's younger brother and his current wife all work at Huawei and related companies, none has held such senior management roles.
""The other family members are in back office, Sabrina is CFO and sits on the board,"" a Huawei source said. ""So she is viewed as the boss's most likely successor.""

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:37AM ET</span>",EU lawmakers adopt softer bad loans cover rules for banks,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers backed new rules on Thursday that would soften requirements on the money that banks must set aside to cover potential losses from new debt that turns sour.
The changes adopted by lawmakers in the economic affairs committee of the European Parliament will need approval from EU governments before they become law. 
They represent an easing of the requirements from a deal reached in October by EU governments, which in turn had softened an earlier European Commission proposal, and met with opposition in some quarters for being too lenient. 
""This is not a prudent approach and does not lead to the risk reduction we need to achieve in European banks' balance sheets,"" Sven Giegold, a Green lawmaker who voted against the watered-down text, said.
In line with the compromise struck by EU states, parliamentarians backed a text that would require banks to fully provide for unsecured loans three years after they turn bad. The commission had proposed a two-year term.
The date for the new requirements to enter into force will not be backdated to March 2018 as had been proposed by the commission, the text agreed by lawmakers said, in line with the compromise reached by EU states in October. 
The parliament also confirmed the a plan to give banks nine years to build a full buffer against bad loans that are secured by immovable collateral, like houses or commercial properties.
Loans secured against less safe movable collateral would have to be fully provided for within seven years from when they are recorded as non-performing.
The sweetener from the parliament came in the provisioning calendar. Under the text voted in the EU assembly, banks would have less strict requirements to cover for bad loan losses in the build-up of their full buffers.
EU states agreed that banks should provide for at least 35 percent of their exposure to unsecured loans two years after they became bad, before a full coverage after three years. But the parliament has canceled the intermediate requirement.

For secured loans, the timetable to build up a full coverage would be less strict in intermediate years before the final-term requirement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's mobile phone services were disrupted in some parts of Japan on Thursday, ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) of its domestic telecoms unit later this month that will potentially raise $21 billion.
Some customers at Japan's third-largest telco have been unable to make calls or use the internet in the hours following the onset of connection problems at 0439 GMT.
The network issues, which stemmed from problems at exchanges for high-speed wireless LTE network, are on the way to resolution, a SoftBank spokeswoman told Reuters. 
SoftBank has 40 million mobile users. 
Shares of the group fell as much as 6 percent after news of the disruption, pressured by a broader market sell-off following the arrest of the global CFO of Huawei Technologies. The two companies have partnered on 5G trials.
Shares of SoftBank Group's telco unit, SoftBank Corp, are set to debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 19. The group will set a final offering price on Dec. 10.

1043,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>","In Brexit Endgame, Complacency and Confusion Bedevil Markets","(Bloomberg) -- May’s deal, no deal, no Brexit at all. If only it were so simple.
With just a few months to go, Britain’s exit from the European Union still presents a baffling array of potential outcomes, including everything from the government being overthrown to a second referendum. And it’s testing the mettle of traders already worn down by two years of political anguish.
Right now, markets appear to be easing up on no-deal bets ahead of a Dec. 11 vote that threatens to torpedo Prime Minister Theresa May’s accord with the European Union. The calculation is that the chances of delaying or even ditching Brexit are increasing. Yet fresh waves of political uncertainty are likely to follow that vote, and there are fears investors may be living in a false sense of security.
“The endgame is very hard to predict,” said Pieter Jansen, a senior investment strategist at NN IP. “Markets are prepared for a soft Brexit outcome and approval of the deal would be a relief to financial markets. In case of a no deal uncertainty would obviously go up.”
Keeping the Faith
The pound isn’t trading at levels that reflect a “more disorderly scenario,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said this week. In the central bank’s own grim assessment of a no-deal exit, sterling could slide by as much as a quarter, but foreign-exchange markets aren’t buying it.
Demand for sterling puts below parity with the dollar -- contracts giving the owner the right to sell a certain amount of the currency at a set price -- represent just half a percentage point of the total traded since September, according to DTCC data.
Put simply, most traders aren’t preparing for the pound to fall below the greenback, as Carney’s prediction implies. Instead, the bulk of the trading activity is for puts between $1.20 and $1.30. Sterling was at $1.2738 as of 9:36 a.m. in London. Even the contracts below $1.20 are concentrated at $1.10 and above.
“Although the odds are clearly against Theresa May, we do not think the markets have yet fully priced in a defeat,” Morten Lund, analyst at Nordea Bank AB, wrote in a note.
He expects the pound to tumble by as much as 4 percent against the euro if May fails to get her deal through Parliament in the first round. The FTSE 100 would also drop amid the political upheaval, offsetting the boost to the local value of overseas earnings from a weaker currency, according to the Nordea strategist.
Sterling Stress
The biggest action for a no-deal outcome is playing out in the sterling options market -- but it’s hard to glean a clean signal.
While the cost of hedging over the next two weeks remains close to 2018 highs, euro-pound risk reversals, another barometer of sentiment, have eased closer to average levels notched last year. The same metric for pound-dollar on a one-week horizon is rallying -- suggesting investors are easing up on their negativity.
Meanwhile, fast-money traders have flipped to long sterling positions of late, in contrast to asset managers.
“I think there is a lot of confusion in the pound market” reflecting the frenetic newsflow and Brexit brinkmanship, said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
Traders in the interest rate market are showing no more certainty. They’re no longer pricing a rate hike next year as a sure thing, in a sign of doubts that a deal will be reached protecting the U.K. economy.
Since the day before Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned -- plunging May’s campaign to sell her deal to colleagues into crisis -- the odds of a 25 basis-point rate increase by the end of 2019 have tumbled from more than full-priced to 87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Traders pushed back wagers on the next rate hike to February 2020.
‘Uninvestable’
With a torrent of outflows and ever-falling valuations, stock investors have given up hope that a withdrawal agreement in the current form will be passed. The FTSE 250 Index is down by more than 10 percent this year.
For good reason. The never-ending political distress has turned the U.K. equity market into no-go territory, with euro-area stocks offering better rewards, according to Sanford C Bernstein Ltd.
“We think that the U.K. market might be ‘uninvestable’ in the specific sense that the near term movement is likely to be dominated by political forces that, bluntly, are very hard to model,” strategists including Inigo Fraser Jenkins wrote in a note last month.
Ain’t So Bad
Yet key pockets of equity derivative markets remain unbowed.
The FTSE 100’s volatility is off its year-to-date highs and has traded below that of the Euro Stoxx 50 and the S&P 500 over the past two months.
On a six-month horizon, covering the U.K.’s exit from the EU in March, implied price swings for large caps has jumped to February levels -- spurred by the U.S. equity rout -- but remains below the referendum peak.
U.K.-listed multinationals offer cheap valuations with protection from further weakness in the sterling. That might explain muted demand to bet against the asset class, with the put-to-call ratio -- the volume of outstanding bearish contracts versus bullish -- tumbling ahead of May’s make-or-break vote.
All told, conviction trades wagering on either doomsday or a reprieve seem to be off the table amid the waves of uncertainty lashing investors of all stripes. As a result, markets risk sleepwalking into a shock.
“The tail risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated by market participants,” David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV last week. “The consensus is still a deal will be done. I think that’s too much complacency, just as there was before the actual Brexit vote itself.”

Autoliv, the world's largest airbag maker, has since 2011 been subject to an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of so-called occupant safety systems - such as seatbelts, steering wheels and airbags - in the European Union. 
The company paid a 8.1 million euro ($9.2 million) fine in the first quarter of this year related to a smaller part of the investigation, completed by the Commission in November 2017.
In that part of the investigation, Toyoda Gosei (T:7282), Takata, Marutaka and Tokai Rika (T:6995) were also fined for taking part in cartels to fix prices for seatbelts, airbags and steering wheels to Japanese carmakers. 
""Management now has reason to believe that the EC (European Commission) will seek to impose a fine in connection with the remaining portion of the EC investigation,"" Autoliv said in a statement. 
""According to management's best estimation and based on the advice of our legal counsel, the company will accrue $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the remaining portion of the EC investigation."" 
Autoliv said it believed a fine could be issued in the first half of 2019, but noted it could be delayed.
Autoliv's Swedish-listed shares were down 2.7 percent at 0815 GMT, slightly underperforming a 2.5 percent drop for the European automotive sector (SXAP). 
The company had previously said it believed the outcome of the Commission's investigation was likely to materially affect operating results.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 03:45AM ET</span>",Former SMBC market boss sets up independent fund,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A former top executive at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) with a reputation as a savvy market player has started an independent global macro fund - a rare move for Japanese bankers, who typically settle on cushy retirement positions provided by their employers.
Seiichiro Takahashi, SMBC's former deputy president, has set up Hawksbridge Capital Co Ltd in Tokyo. The company will start operations from Dec 10 and it aims to build up assets under management to around 100 billion yen ($884.41 million) within one or two years, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
SMBC is a core banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316), Japan's third-largest lender by assets.
Takahashi is a veteran SMBC hand, having joined Sumitomo Bank in 1979 and spending most of his career in dealing rooms, where he earned a reputation as a savvy market player.
Nicknamed as ""Asia's tiger,"" he is credited with heading currency and derivatives trading desks that generated profits when the bank was hit by massive bad loan costs in early 2000s.
He was the head of the bank's market division when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis in 2008. Those who knew Takahashi then said he saw signs of market change well ahead of the crisis and moved to offload subprime-related assets from the portfolio, saving the bank from big losses that had crippled rivals.
Takahashi is also known as a friend of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He stepped down as SMBC's deputy president last year.
His new fund management company focuses on ""global macro"" strategy, investing in traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, said the source, who declined to be identified. It has a team of five traders and one research analyst, the person said.
Hawksbridge officials were not immediately available for comment.

OSLO (Reuters) - Budget carrier Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) struggled to fill its aircraft in November as capacity growth far outpaced demand, its monthly traffic report showed, sending its shares down 6 percent in early trade.
The company, which has been courted by British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG), has ramped up its transatlantic business but has also said that growth will slow as it prioritizes profitability over expansion.
""Several of our summer routes have been extended into November, which has affected the load factor,"" Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement.
""A full transition into the winter program will take place early next year, once the busy holiday season is behind us.""
While the airline's capacity grew 34 percent year-on-year in November, revenue-generating passenger kilometers increased by 26 percent, lagging a forecast of 33.7 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The load factor, a measure of how many seats are sold on each flight, fell to 78.8 percent for the month, the lowest since May 2014. That fell short of a forecast of 82.7 percent and was down from 83.7 percent a year ago.
""Overall, we find the traffic figures to be soft,"" Danske Bank analyst Martin Stenshall said in a note to clients.
On the positive side, the company's November yield, a key measure of revenue per passenger carried and kilometers flown, was unchanged year on year at 0.33 Norwegian crowns. Analysts had expected it to ease to 0.32 crowns.

Norwegian's shares were down 5.7 percent lower at 201 Norwegian crowns at 0805 GMT, against a 1.1 percent drop for the Oslo benchmark index (OSEBX).

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>",East European energy firms charge into EV market,"By Michael Kahn
PRAGUE (Reuters) - For trips near their village in western Poland, Jacek Balcer and his wife zip around in their electric cars. But when they want to travel further afield they know it's time to bring out their diesel van or risk being stranded.
""If you want to go big distances in Poland you often can't find a charging station,"" said Jacek. ""It is still impossible.""
It's a similar story in other central and eastern European countries in the EU but with such a small number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, building charging networks hasn't been a priority for governments.
But that's all set to change. The number of EVs in the region of 100 million people stretching from Poland in the north to Bulgaria in the south is expected to surge when tighter European Union emissions rules come into force in 2020.
The biggest network of fast-charging stations in the region is run by privately-held GreenWay https://greenwaypolska.pl/en with 112 in Poland and Slovakia. But with the EU now aiming for a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, some of the region's biggest energy companies are muscling into the market.
CEZ (PR:CEZP) in the Czech Republic and MOL (BU:MOLB) in Hungary say they are planning to expand networks of fast-charging stations across the region.
""This is where the electricity and energy business is moving,"" said Tomas Chmelik, head of clean technologies at CEZ, central Europe's largest listed company. ""If we do not invest, somebody else will and it's a logical extension out of the traditional business into a new business.""
Chmelik estimates that by 2020 there will be about 10,000 EVs on Czech roads and up to 250,000 by 2030. CEZ aims to more than double the number of fast-charging stations it operates to over 150 by the end of 2019.
CEZ plans to spend about 1 billion Czech crowns ($44 million) over the next 10 years to achieve this - with about half coming from subsidies to build a network of 50 kilowatts (kW) fast chargers able to handle CHAdeMO https://www.chademo.com and CCS standards.
FIRST MOVERS
While weather and battery capacity are factors, fast chargers of up to 50 kW can typically provide power for a range of 150 km in 30 minutes while ultra-fast charging stations of up to 150 kW can do the job in 10 minutes, according to GreenWay. 
CEZ will focus on its home market before expanding in countries where it already operates, including Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. It could also look for acquisitions to grow faster, Chmelik said. 
""We will logically look at countries where we are already active,"" he said. ""Utilities are looking to build networks over the long run and I expect the market to get consolidated in the next five years.
Power utilities, tech start-ups and oil companies are all fighting to establish themselves as dominant players in the business. Swiss bank UBS estimates $360 billion will need to be spent over the next eight years to build a global charging infrastructure to keep pace with electric car sales. 
Yet as companies bet on electric cars, there's a risk governments in central and eastern Europe will move slowly to jump-start a market that lags many western European countries.
In Poland - a nation of 40 million and eastern Europe's biggest economy - there are just 2,981 plug-in vehicles, according to EV-volumes.com http://www.ev-volumes.com, a Swedish company that compiles data on the EV industry.
Yet Poland has targeted electro-mobility as an important part of its economic strategy and set a target of 1 million electric cars by 2025.
There are 3,128 EVs in Hungary and 2,473 in the Czech Republic but Europe's market leader, Norway, has 239,000 and Germany 198,000. Hungary has a target of 30,000 by 2020.
""The prize is becoming the first mover,"" said Ivan Kondratenko, an analyst covering electric mobility at Frost & Sullivan https://ww2.frost.com in Warsaw. ""Eventually there will be an uptake of electric cars in CEE so they want to have the infrastructure ready to accommodate these customers.""
""If they invest now in the future there will be less problems with potential revenues, or losing out on additional revenues.""
EXPANSION PLANS
Hungarian oil and gas company MOL has begun shifting its strategy to prepare for less demand for fossil fuels over the next decade, said Peter Ratatics, who leads the company's consumer services business.
MOL plans to invest up to 30 million euros ($34 million) by the end of 2020 to build a network of up to 700 charging stations in Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, he said.
The investment could generate roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of the company's traditional retail business in the next 10 years and up to 50 percent by 2040, Ratatics said. In 2018 its retail division is expected to generate $420 million.
""We came to the conclusion that because of changing regulation and customer behavior the fossil fuel market will change over the next decade,"" he said. ""This will have a significant impact on MOL's traditional oil and gas business.""
""We are now trying not just to start building up the electric charging stations but also the knowledge of how the e-mobility business is taking shape.""
MOL, along with Germany's E.ON (DE:EONGn), Croatia's HEP, Slovenia's  Petrol  (LJ:PETG), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Nissan's (T:7201) Hungarian unit, is also part of an EU-subsidized project to build 252 fast and ultra-fast charging stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania.
Smaller players such as Greenway are also looking to use EU subsidies to continue to expand and win market share.
With CEZ and MOL starting in their home markets and Polish companies such as Orlen just gearing up, Greenway plans to have 630 charging stations in place in Poland by 2020 with another 230 in Slovakia and elsewhere in the region.
The company, which is already building its first ultra-fast charging stations, will target the Czech Republic and Balkans next, said founder Peter Badik. 
GreenWay began installing road-side chargers in 2015 and its Slovak entity is a member of a consortium working on a regional project led by Austria's  Verbund  (VI:VERB).
""At the moment the pie is big enough for everyone,"" Badik said. ""It's a market which lacks many strong competitors and there is a lot of possibility to grow in a very big market as the region catches up with western Europe.""

Murray Goulburn had reached a settlement in November with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in a court case over the misrepresentations about farmgate milk prices. The ACCC had said earlier it would not seek a penalty against the company.
""The penalty imposed against Mr Helou reflects his seniority at Murray Goulburn and involvement in misleading representations about the farmgate milk price,"" ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said in a statement from the regulator.
Helou and Murray Goulburn could not be contacted immediately.
In April 2016, Murray Goulburn cut the price it paid milk suppliers by 20 percent in a move that angered dairy farmers, who said the cut came so late in the season they had little chance but to continue producing milk at a loss.
After a year-long investigation, the ACCC said Murray Goulburn had never indicated to its farmer shareholders any potential risk to prices.
Murray Goulburn confirmed the fine to Helou in its own statement, and said the Federal Court also ordered the dairy co-operative to contribute A$200,000 and Helou A$50,000 toward the ACCC's court costs.

China Railway’s Chairman Chen Fenjian met with President Juan Carlos Varela earlier in the week to discuss entering the market in Panama and building infrastructure in the country. The Chinese company seeks to “strengthen the cooperation and exchanges regarding building infrastructure and investment.”
Chen visited Panama with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who stressed the need for more collaboration between the two countries and offered help to build a high-speed railway connecting Panama City with the western province of Chiriqui, according to China Daily.
China and Panama signed an agreement under the Belt and Road Initiative in November last year on technology cooperation and boosting China’s involvement in Panama’s rail network. "
1055,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","As OPEC Meets, New Energy ETFs Spy Opportunity in Oil's Decline","(Bloomberg) -- Cushing Asset Management has a lot riding on the meeting of OPEC in Vienna Thursday -- specifically, the success of its first exchange-traded funds.
On the heels of the worst month for crude since 2008, the Dallas-based investment firm, which manages about $3.3 billion in energy-related portfolios, is listing four sector ETFs connected to petroleum. The funds -- which focus on energy, utilities, transportation and the energy supply chain -- will look to deliver extra yield by investing some of their assets in companies set up as master limited partnerships.
It’s either terrible timing, or a stroke of genius. With oil having lost 22 percent in November and now trading at around $54 a barrel, OPEC could put a floor under the price by cutting its production. But with President Donald Trump pushing for lower prices, there’s a chance that exporters could let the price hold at this level, or slide even further.
“Calling a bottom is always rife with a challenge,” said Todd Sunderland, Cushing’s head of risk management and quant strategies. “If they do what I think most people expect with a reasonable cut, we do have a decent launching pad going into 2019 for energy and energy equities. But it’s a really difficult call.”
The funds won’t be cheap, carrying a fee of 0.65 percent, more than eight times the 0.08 percent charged by the least expensive energy ETF run by Fidelity Investments.
Cushing will allocate up to 24 percent of each fund’s assets to so-called MLPs, which operate primarily in the energy sector and tend to yield more than other equities. MLPs aren’t part of traditional indexed funds as their structure can necessitate laborious tax disclosures if they exceed 25 percent of a fund’s portfolio. Ironically, the master limited partnership model for oil and natural gas conduits has fallen out of favor this year, due in part to a tax change proposed in March that pummeled the companies’ unit prices.
The firm has previously provided MLP indexes to exchange-traded notes run by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).

The private-equity firm is the latest to tap into surging investor interest in the region. Centum Investment Co., Kenya’s second-biggest publicly traded investment company, is planning to raise 50 billion shillings ($487 million) for its second fund, while closely held Catalyst Principal Partners last month raised $155 million.
Ascent, based in Nairobi, plans to woo Kenyan pension funds and businesses that invested in its inaugural $80 million, co-founder Lucas Kranck said Monday in a phone interview from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The European Investment Bank is considering investing $25 million in the fund, he said.
“We have started speaking with development-finance institutions because they need time to do due diligence and make decisions,” Kranck said. “We also hope to get more Kenyan institutional money into the fund.”
Ascent’s new fund, christened the Ascent Rift Valley Fund II, will be based in Mauritius and targets raising as much as $90 million in the first round, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019. The final target is expected to be achieved 12 months after the first close, he said.
EIB Decision
The EIB’s management committee will make a decision on its potential investment early next year, a spokesman for the Luxembourg-based lender said Wednesday by email.
The value of private-equity deals in East Africa surged to $482.1 million in the eight months through August, compared with just $19 million a year earlier, according to I&M Burbidge Capital Ltd., a Kenyan financial-advisory group.
The ARVF II fund, which is seeking a 20 percent internal rate of return, is banking on its team’s “deep local knowledge” to attract investors, Kranck said. He’s worked in East Africa for more than a decade, serving as regional general manager for Nokia (HE:NOKIA) Solutions & Networks Oy. David Owino, another co-founder, was previously director of private equity at Centum.
Ascent plans to make new investments in fast-moving consumer goods, health-care, manufacturing and financial-services companies in Tanzania and Rwanda, adding to Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, which were covered under the first fund, Kranck said.
Minimum Stake
“These are markets we know, and it’s good to deal with markets we know well,” he said.
The proposed fund will target deals of $3 million to $15 million, taking either a majority stake or minority shareholding of at least 25 percent in companies it invests in, Kranck said.
A growing population, rising consumer demand among the middle class and access to larger regional markets through Africa’s larger cities and regional hubs is attracting growing amounts of foreign direct investment to the continent, according to the African Development Bank.
Ascent has so far invested $42 million from its first fund in eight companies including two in health-care, four manufacturing businesses, one mobile-money agent and a retail distributor, Kranck said.

Canada’s Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver due to violations of U.S. sanctions. She is facing extradition to the United States, according to various media.
Following the announcement, China’s embassy in Canada criticised Canada and the U.S. for wrongfully arresting Meng and demanded her immediate release.
“The Canadian police, at the request of the United States, arrested a Chinese citizen who had not violated any U.S. or Canadian law,” the embassy said in a short statement on its website.
“China has already made solemn representations to the United States and Canada, demanding they immediately correct their wrong behaviour and restore Ms Meng Wanzhou’s freedom.”
The news broke after the U.S. and China agreed to halt the planned increase in tariffs to 25% from 10% on Chinese imports earlier this week.
China’s Ministry of Commerce released its first official statement on the meeting on Wednesday and said the trade meeting with the U.S. was “very successful”, although it did not provide any further details on the outcome of the meeting.
The Ministry added that Beijing would begin to work quickly to implement specific issues already agreed upon, as both sides ""actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map"".
Hours later, Bloomberg News reported that officials have begun preparing to restart imports of U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index last traded at 26,061.00 by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), down 2.9%. China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both down 1.3% and 1.6%.
Meanwhile, Australia’s ASX 200 slipped 0.7% after data showed the country's trade surplus in October came in at around AUD 2.3 billion instead of the expected AUD 3.2 billion from a Reuters poll.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 2.8 percent as of 10:50 a.m., while the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.1 percent. Technology stocks were among the hardest hit in both markets as Huawei suppliers tumbled. Huawei CFO Wanzhou Meng is facing extradition to the U.S. after her arrest in Vancouver in connection with potential violations by the company of American sanctions on Iran, according to Canada’s Department of Justice. The yuan slipped for a second day, weakening 0.23 percent against the dollar.
""The news on Huawei comes at a bad time when investor sentiment is weak"" and when there’s lack of reasons to buy the market toward year-end, said Toshihiko Takamoto, a Singapore-based money manager at Asset Management One. ""The consensus is that this trade war may drag on for 10 years.""
The news on the Chinese tech giant adds to investor skepticism over the progress of China-U.S. trade relations. While selling pressure eased on Wednesday following China’s pledge to move quickly on U.S. trade commitments, doubts remain over whether there’s been any real breakthrough. When concerns flared in November that the U.S. was ramping up a campaign against Huawei, the Shanghai Composite Index slumped, with technology shares heavily hit.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index was headed for a two-day decline of 4 percent, its biggest such drop since Feb. 9. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index retreated 2.5 percent on Thursday, with AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. and Huawei supplier Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. declining more than 4.5 percent. ZTE Corp (HK:0763). slid at least 5 percent in Hong Kong and in Shenzhen.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>","Uber plans smaller, more cautious self-driving car launch","By Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc's  is plotting the return of its self-driving cars, but the company known for its hard-charging style is taking a much more conservative approach as it tries to recover from a fatal accident that upended its autonomous vehicle program.
After it receives approval from the state of Pennsylvania, Uber plans to begin driving ""a handful"" of cars on a mile loop between two company offices in Pittsburgh, where Uber first debuted its autonomous vehicles in 2016, company spokeswoman Sarah Abboud said. That would mark Uber's first self-driving car tests on public streets since it halted its operations nearly nine months ago in the wake of a crash in Arizona that killed a pedestrian.
The diminutive launch is a dramatic downsize from Uber's previous operation. The company in the past unleashed its fleet in autonomous mode on public roads at high speeds, after dark, in areas crowded with pedestrians and with a single backup driver in the front seat. 
This time, the cars will not operate at night or in wet weather, and will not exceed speeds of 25 miles per hour, Abboud said. Two employees will sit in the front seats, and the company has no plans to resume picking up passengers in the robot cars, a service Uber launched in 2016.
The New York Times first reported on Uber's plans on Wednesday.
Abboud said Uber was awaiting approval from Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation and would not begin testing before then. She said there was no firm start date.
In March, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber's ability to test its self-driving cars after one of its cars hit and killed a woman crossing the street at night in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, Uber's largest testing hub. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing program. 
Resuming an autonomous driving program is crucial. Uber has a deal with Volvo to purchase up to 24,000 cars, and recently Toyota invested $500 million to develop self-driving cars with Uber.
Uber had pledged to start self-driving operations by this past summer in Pittsburgh, but the company faced immense pressure from regulators, federal investigators and an internal review of safety practices. Last month, Uber released a safety report that outlined several changes, including enabling an automatic braking system and improving the cars' ability to quickly detect and react to objects on the road.

The National Transportation Safety Board has an ongoing investigation into the Arizona crash, the findings of which are expected in a major report next year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell late on Wednesday, following the previous session's dramatic sell-off and lingering worries over trade and economic growth.
S&P 500 e-mini futures  were last down 0.7 percent, with volume at 66,034 contracts.
The losses in the first few minutes of trading might have been even steeper, but CME Group's Chicago Mercantile Exchange implemented a series of 10-second trading halts that helped limit the initial drop.
Investors were wary of hot-button issues that could create volatility in the coming days and weeks, including Thursday's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Britain's Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on a Brexit plan, and a 90-day deadline for a U.S.-China trade agreement.
""Tomorrow is certainly going to be about testing that close"" from Tuesday, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""I suspect we're going to go lower tomorrow at some point during the day."" 
U.S. stocks had tumbled more than 3 percent on Tuesday as the U.S. bond market sent unsettling signs about economic growth and investors worried anew about global trade. U.S. equity and bond markets were closed Wednesday, a day of mourning for former President George H.W. Bush, 94, who died on Friday.
Skepticism about prospects for a trade deal was a key reason behind Tuesday's decline. But China expressed confidence on Wednesday it could reach a deal, a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump a day after he warned of more tariffs if the two sides could not agree. 
""You saw the U.S. equity markets catch up to what the bond markets already knew earlier this week – there really is no done deal when it comes to trade and tariffs,"" said David Lafferty, senior vice president and chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. ""I think U.S. investors are now going to ask themselves, Will the market again fall for the head fakes?""
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, and other investors said Tuesday's sell-off could lead to some bargain hunting on Thursday, but he said uncertainty over trade and other issues will heavily influence sentiment in the near term.
Investors were also anxiously awaiting Friday's jobs report. 

""We've got a very narrow path for the bull,"" Paulsen said. ""People aren't talking about it, but in some sense the primary problem is stagflation. It's a problem that you've got people worried about too hot and too cold at the same time.""

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>","GM CEO will keep 'open mind' on plant closings, acknowledges anger","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra on Wednesday vowed to keep an ""open mind"" about the future of an Ohio plant that will lose vehicle production, but warned the Detroit automaker has excess capacity and did not suggest the company was reconsidering the plan.
Barra came under pressure from Ohio's two U.S. senators and other lawmakers who want GM to shift production of a vehicle from Mexico or build electric vehicles at the Lordstown Assembly plant in their state that the automaker has said it intends to close.
""I want to make sure that the workforce knows that there are limitations and we do have an overcapacity across the country,"" Barra said, urging workers at plants set to close to take seriously offers of GM jobs in other parts of the countries.
In a brief Reuters interview after her meetings Wednesday, she said it would be ""very costly"" to shift production from Mexico of the Chevrolet Blazer due to be launched in the next few days.
U.S. President Donald Trump told GM last week that the company had ""better"" find a new vehicle to build at the plant in Ohio, which could be crucial to his re-election chances in 2020.
Asked about Trump's comments, Barra did not directly answer but said she understood the strong reaction in Washington.
""I understand this is something that impacts the country and I understand that there is a lot of emotion and concern about it,"" Barra said.
GM said last week it would close five North American assembly plants next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs as it blames slow selling car sales for the need to restructure.
The CEO said GM planned to add other products at U.S. plants next year and that the automaker would have some jobs to fill at other Ohio facilities in 2019.
She cast the decision as critical to keep GM competitive. In the interview, she said GM wanted to ""do the right thing for our employees but also make sure General Motors is strong and lean in the future.""
Senator Rob Portman said Barra made no promises about the future of the Lordstown plant in Ohio, where the soon-to-be-discontinued Chevrolet Cruze sedans are manufactured. 
Barra said the plant's ultimate status will be determined during contract talks next year with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
""We're not asking for charity."" Portman said, adding the members are asking for a new product for the plant to build.
GM has come under harsh criticism from lawmakers and from President Donald Trump since Nov. 26, when the No. 1 U.S. automaker announced the biggest restructuring since its bankruptcy a decade ago.
Portman said he spoke to fellow Republican Trump on Wednesday about GM.
Barra is in Washington for meetings with lawmakers, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as well as lawmakers from Ohio and Maryland. She was also expected to meet with lawmakers from Michigan on Thursday, among other meetings. After GM announced its plans, Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation.
Administration officials later said they wanted to end subsidies for electric cars in 2020 or 2021, affecting GM and other automakers.
Trump also said new auto tariffs were being studied, asserting, without evidence, that they could prevent job cuts such as those planned by GM.
The UAW has objected to GM's plan to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during contract talks in 2015. The union has asked GM to rescind the decision and resolve the fate of the plants in talks for a new labor contract next year.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - About 100 United Steelworkers union (USW) members rallied on Wednesday outside a  LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) Houston oil refinery over a lack of negotiations there on a new local contract. 
Talks on a national oil-workers agreement are due to begin next month with Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa), as the lead industry negotiator. Existing union contracts expire on Feb. 1. 
However, local groups are beginning discussions on individual plant issues ahead of the national talks. At least four other plants also have begun exchanging proposals on local issues, according to the USW. 
LyondellBasell officials did not begin talks on union local issues as planned on Monday, Marcos Velez, a USW International representative said in an interview on Wednesday. The existing contract covering the plant's 485 union workers expires on Feb. 1.
""They called and said they couldn't make it (Monday) and would call about meeting Tuesday,"" Velez said. ""It's Wednesday and we're still waiting to meet.""
A Lyondell spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The USW group carried signs that said ""coming soon"" and showed silhouettes of people picketing. Union-represented Lyondell workers were off their jobs for 3 1/2 months during a strike and contract talks in 2015. 
The national agreement, which covers wages, job security, health and safety issues, will be combined with terms of the agreement on local issues at each plant to complete the contract for each location. 
Velez said Lyondell also canceled meetings during the 2015 strike.
""It's not uncommon, but it's unacceptable,"" he said.
During the rally, USW activist Joshua Lege used a bullhorn to speak to the workers, many of them wearing blue work coveralls as they lined up in front of the refinery.
""They say they want peace and professionalism, but they want war,"" Lege said. 
The national contract covers about 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers. In September, union officials agreed to seek 8 percent annual wage increases and a 3-year contract in the coming negotiations. 
The contract would cover plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC)  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (N:HFC) and  Delek US Holdings Inc  (N:DK).

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 05:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Blackstone plans IPO of U.S. benefits manager Alight - sources,"By David French and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) is readying an initial public offering (IPO) of Alight Solutions LLC, a U.S. provider of healthcare and retirement benefits services that could be valued at more than $7 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
The IPO could come in the first half of 2019, the four sources said, almost two years after Blackstone acquired Alight from insurance broker Aon Plc (N:AON), in a deal that valued it up to $4.8 billion. It would allow Blackstone to turn a profit by gradually selling its Alight stake in the stock market.
Blackstone has hired Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) to underwrite Alight's IPO, the sources said. Blackstone will also consider any acquisition offers it may receive for Alight, even as it is focused on taking the company public, the sources added.
The IPO could raise between $500 million and $750 million, one of the sources said, cautioning that its exact timing depended on market conditions.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Blackstone, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Alight and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Buyout firms have been prolific investors in businesses that help companies cut costs by outsourcing large parts of their administrative functions, since such operations can generate strong cash flows. 
Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Alight offers benefits administration and cloud-based human resources services to 22 million people, and generated revenue of $2.3 billion in 2017, according to its website.
Before selling Alight to Blackstone last year, Aon had taken ownership of it as part of its acquisition in 2010 of Hewitt Associates Inc for $4.9 billion.
Dealmaking has heated up in the benefits sector this year, as some of these companies turn to dealmaking to counter fierce price competition for their services.
In October, French IT services company Atos SE (PA:ATOS) completed a $3.4 billion cash deal to buy Michigan-based IT services provider Syntel Inc, and last week payroll processor  Paychex Inc  (O:PAYX) agreed to buy Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp for $1.2 billion in cash.
In another deal by a private equity firm,  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) said in September that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc, the largest U.S. insurance claims service provider, for $6.7 billion.

Ford's unit in Valencia, which has not received any orders for 2019, is offering the equivalent of $150 for each year worked to all 915 employees at the plant, the union leaders told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media about the issue.
Ford would not confirm the report, and emphasized instead that operations would continue in Venezuela, which is suffering under a hyperinflationary economic collapse.
""Ford works diligently to adapt to the local conditions and continue serving customers with products and services,"" Ford said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Ford has been operating in Venezuela for 56 years and has no plans to leave the country.""
In the past two months, 93 Explorer and Fiesta vehicles were assembled at the plant, the statement said.
The union officials said total production this year has been about 220 vehicles, less than half 2017's output, due to a lack of orders and the difficulty of buying parts.
The plant used to produce as many as 17,000 cars annually before Venezuela's economy entered a now five-year recession, with 2018 inflation expected to top one million percent. 
Ford this year started restructuring underperforming operations in Latin America, Europe and China as part of a strategy to fund investments in autonomous and electric vehicles.
Ford's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, said in July that the automaker's South American operations had not earned an appropriate return on investment since 2004 and the company was focused on a ""significant redesign"" in the region.

Ford rival General Motors Co. (N:GM) left Venezuela in 2017. A handful of multinationals have remained by slashing production and limiting product variety, but shrinking demand could lead many of them to exit in 2019.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Albemarle pushes Chile to reverse lithium quota decision - filings,"By Dave Sherwood and Ernest Scheyder
SANTIAGO/HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB) has launched an aggressive lobbying campaign after Chilean regulators denied its request to boost lithium output, stressing the company's importance to Chile's economy and workers, according to records reviewed by Reuters. 
The behind-the-scenes moves come even as Albemarle has publicly brushed off worries from analysts and investors about rising regulatory pressure in Chile, home to the world's largest reserves of lithium, a crucial ingredient in electric car batteries and mobile phones. 
Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, who became Albemarle's Chile country manager in October, met with the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) on Nov. 23 to discuss the rejection, according to filings with Chile's lobbyist transparency website that have been previously unreported. 
The nuclear agency, which oversees lithium sales and export from Chile, had rejected Albemarle's request in September to increase its quota to sell lithium. That effectively stunted the long-term expansion plans of the world's top producer of the ultralight metal.
Albemarle Chief Executive Luke Kissam stressed in a November conference call with investors that the rejection from CCHEN was ""not a big deal, OK? It's not a big deal."" 
But Lenny-Pessagno, a former diplomat who has held senior roles with the U.S. State Department advocating for U.S. renewable energy companies in Spain, Chile and Colombia, told CCHEN's interim director, Mauricio Lichtemberg, that the regulator's September decision was having an impact on its workers and investors, according to minutes from the meeting.
Albemarle did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Lenny-Pessagno discussed ""how important Albemarle is to Chile from an investment standpoint, as a source of direct employment and for contractors,"" the minutes show.
Albemarle pays Chile more than $100 million annually in lithium royalties, giving it some financial and political sway in the country.
Lenny-Pessagno's visit to CCHEN was the second in as many months by an Albemarle executive. Eric Norris, chief of Albemarle's lithium division, had flown to Santiago from the company's North Carolina headquarters in October, shortly after the rejection, according to the lobbyist transparency records.
AUSTRALIA VS. CHILE?
Lenny-Pessagno also referred to the U.S.-based miner's investments in other countries, meeting minutes show.
She told Chile's nuclear regulator that Albemarle was making new investments in Australia, which vies with Chile to be the world's top lithium producer.
The day before the meeting, Albemarle had announced a $1.15 billion deal to form a joint venture with Australia's Mineral Resources Ltd (AX:MIN).
That venture, if finalized, would eventually produce more lithium than Albemarle has authorization to sell from Chile.
CCHEN's Lichtemberg reiterated to Lenny-Pessagno the same points it had made in the initial ruling in September, the minutes show.
The agency has not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the details of the rejection. 
But it has said that Albemarle had failed to provide requested details about how it plans to triple lithium production from Chile's Salar de Atacama without using more water.
Regulators are cracking down on water use by both copper and lithium miners in the salar, which lies at the heart of the world's driest desert.

Last month, Reuters reported that environmental regulators had rejected Albemarle's plans to build a plant to process 42,500 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually on Chile's coast, another critical facet of its long-term plans.

1077,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. ADP Employment, Services PMI Highlight Indicators
The economic calendar is packed tomorrow as most of the Wednesday releases were delayed for the national day of mourning for former President George H.W. Bush.
ADP’s measure of private nonfarm employment, closely watched ahead of Friday’s official labor report, will be released at 8:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT). Private payrolls are expected to have grown by 195,000 in November, according to economists.
At 8:30 AM ET the weekly measure of initial jobless claims arrives, with economists predicting a drop to 226,000 for the latest period.
October factory orders come in at 10:00 AM ET, with a 1.9% drop predicted.
At the same time, the ISM will release its measure of services activity in the economy for November will be released.
On average, economists expect that the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell slightly to 59.2 last month.
2. OPEC Meeting Begins
The oil market will be particularly active as OPEC gets its meeting in Vienna underway.
Traders have been grappling with mixed signals from Saudi Arabia about whether there will be a production cut as the kingdom does not want to bear the brunt of any supply contraction by itself and also wants to avoid irking President Donald Trump.
Russia, which is expected to participate in any cut, has also been cagey.
In addition, traders will have the latest weekly oil inventories data – pushed forward a day – to digest at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT).
The big rise in U.S. crude stockpiles is a major reason why oil prices tumbled sharply last month.
Traders are expecting a decline this time around, with inventories forecast to have dropped by more than 2 million barrels.
3. Kroger Looks for Sales Comeback
Among earnings before the bell tomorrow, supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) will issue results.
Kroger shares are lower over the past three months as the broader market selloff made it tough for the company to recover from a sharp drop in mid-September when it reported quarterly sales below estimates.
Analysts are predicting a profit of 43 cents per share on sales of about $27.7 billion.
Other retailers reporting include Duluth Holdings (NASDAQ:DLTH) and Lands’ End (NASDAQ:LE)."

Fifty-seven percent of New York City residents who responded to the poll approved of Amazon building one of two secondary headquarters in the Long Island City area of Queens, more than double the 26 percent who said they oppose the move, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. 
Respondents were divided on the $2.8 billion in tax breaks and incentives offered to attract Amazon, with 46 percent supporting them versus 44 percent who oppose the package, the poll found. 
Amazon last month announced plans to spend $5 billion on two new headquarters - one in Long Island City and one in Arlington, Virginia, outside of Washington - which the company said will each employ more than 25,000 people. Bidding for the campuses attracted hundreds of offers from states and cities in a year-long process that garnered widespread publicity for the company. 
Results of the poll suggest that critics of the project will have trouble derailing it. 
Local residents, including city and state lawmakers, have criticized arrangements that minimized the need for Amazon to obtain local approvals that would ordinarily be required of such projects. 
Some city councillors and state representatives have said they oppose the deal, due to the large tax breaks and potential infrastructure impact to the Queens neighborhood, as have some local residents who have turned to social media to express their concerns. 

Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,075 New York City registered voters for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs likely to boost legal reserves for 1MDB: analysts,"By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) may need to boost its legal reserves by as much as $1 billion to prepare for potential penalties related to its dealings with the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, analysts said.
The U.S. investment bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise funds through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) [TERRN.UL], which is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.
U.S. prosecutors have brought criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers. Goldman has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
The bank is in ""active conversations"" with the DOJ and has been for almost two years, Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday.
In November, the bank disclosed in a securities filing that it may face penalties from dealings with 1MDB.
In interviews this week, analysts said Goldman might have to set aside $500 million to $1 billion for legal reserves in the next few quarters to prepare for potential fines. The bank does not disclose its total reserves.
That amount would not have a large impact on Goldman's capital levels, but could lead management to restrict bonuses in order to send a message that it takes the matter seriously, said Marty Mosby, director of bank and equity strategies at Vining Sparks.
UBS analyst Brennan Hawken wrote in a note that expectations for potential fines typically range from the $600 million banking fees Goldman earned from 1MDB transactions to the $2.5 billion sum embezzled from the funds.
The Department of Justice estimates that $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the funds by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has said his country would seek a ""full refund"" of around $600 million in fees the bank earned from raising $6.5 billion for the fund.
A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment for this article.
Longer-term revenue could also be at risk if the scandal hurts Goldman's reputation in Asia-Pacific, Hawken wrote. The bank derives 15 percent of its revenue from that region.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Betsy Graseck downgraded the bank's stock last month, citing regulatory concerns. The stock has fallen 4 percent from $192.60 to $184.31 since the note's release.
Goldman may not have to bolster reserves until it is clear fines will be imposed and it may not want to boost reserves, said Geoffrey Miller, a professor and expert in banking regulation and law at New York University School of Law.

Reserving too early can ""be taken as a sign of how much you are expecting to pay, and thus set an unfavorable anchor for settlement negotiations,"" he said.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Chairman of Britain's Crossrail and HS2 project resigns,"LONDON (Reuters) - The chairman of Britain's delayed 15-billion-pound London Crossrail project, Terry Morgan, has resigned, the Department of Transport said on Wednesday.
Morgan, 70, also stepped down as Chairman of the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project connecting London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.
Crossrail is one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects and is running almost 600 million pounds over budget with extra funding required to complete the work.
In August, it was announced that its planned opening this month had been delayed to Autumn 2019 because it requires more time for testing and for final work to be completed.
When fully open, the Elizabeth line, as it is officially known, will connect destinations like Heathrow Airport in west London to areas such as the Canary Wharf financial district in the east.
Morgan, who had been in the Crossrail job for almost a decade, had predicted earlier this month he would be ousted after the delay.
He told the BBC: ""I can only assume that because HS2 is such a critically important program and with the sense of disappointment around the performance of Crossrail, that it was considered to be too risky for a program like HS2 to continue (with me) as chairman.""
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Sir Terry has been an integral part of Crossrail for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2 Ltd.
Morgan will be replaced at HS2 by Allan Cook, a former chairman of engineers WS Atkins Plc and a director of U.S. banker J.F. Lehman and Co. The Crossrail chairmanship will be announced later.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said he had been concerned about the effectiveness of Crossrail's governance.
He added in a statement: ""Under new leadership, Crossrail must provide the joint sponsors and Londoners with the confidence that it has robust mechanisms in place to deliver a revised schedule, operating with a renewed sense of urgency and transparency across all parts of the project.""

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",AIG hit with $750 million to $800 million in fourth-quarter catastrophe losses: CEO,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - American International Group (N:AIG) Inc has racked up an estimated $750 million to $800 million in catastrophe losses so far during the 2018 fourth quarter, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday.
Still, the company's general insurance unit is on track to enter 2019 ""at a slight underwriting profit,"" AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said at the Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York.
The catastrophe losses do not include December, Duperreault said.
Duperreault, who took charge of AIG in 2017, has vowed to turn the company around. His most critical task is overhauling AIG’s underwriting culture after the company spent years chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.
AIG company expects an overall eight percent adjusted return on equity going into 2019, driven in part by the slight underwriting profit in its general insurance unit, Duperreault said on Wednesday. 
""But let me be clear. We are not satisfied with an eight percent,"" Duperreault said. The company intends to reach a double-digit adjusted return on equity, but the process could take up to three years, he added.
""The problems that AIG had when I arrived were the result of over a decade of firefighting but we are moving beyond that era,” Duperreault said.
AIG expects the unit's 2019 net earned premium to be consistent with 2018 levels, Duperreault said.
Wildfires in California, net of reinsurance, will add between $150 million and $175 million to AIG's net pretax losses for the fourth quarter, since the company has triggered its reinsurance coverage, Duperreault said. AIG expects its Validus Holdings Ltd unit, the reinsurer it acquired in July, to incur about a $60 million pretax loss for wildfires, he added.
Earnings for AIG's Life and Retirement will decrease for the second half of 2019, partly related to investment in new business and ""growth initiatives,"" Duperreault said.
The insurer's fourth quarter effective tax rate will be around 26 percent because of global catastrophes and a shift in business mix, he said.
On Tuesday, AIG named its chief actuary, Mark Lyons as chief financial officer. Lyons replaces Sid Sankaran, who joined the company in 2015. 

Sankaran will remain at AIG as an adviser through the year-end reporting process for fiscal year 2018, the company said.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 11:45AM ET</span>",Global cement demand forecast to grow 1.5 percent in 2019,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Global demand for cement is seen growing by 1.5 percent next year, the World Cement Association said on Wednesday, as economic risks and trade tensions weigh on the construction industry in many countries.
The demand forecast is an improvement from the 0.5 percent dip in cement volumes seen in 2018, and 1 percent increase during 2017, the trade association said.
Next year's improvement is mainly down to a better situation in China, which consumes more than half of the world's cement and where demand is expected to grow by 0.5 percent after two years of declines.
But outside China, the WCA foresaw subdued demand. In the world excluding China, it forecast cement demand to increase by 2.8 percent in 2018, down from a 3.3 percent rise in 2018.
The body, which has 72 members, cited rising economic risks and companies' shuttering plants to tackle over-capacity as the main reasons for the deceleration.
""Overall WCA forecasts indicate 2019 will be a year when the world cement market will see subdued demand, and the outlook is relatively weaker than 2017 and 2018,"" it said, adding the year ahead would be ""challenging"" for many cement producers.
LafargeHolcim (S:LHN), the world's largest cement company, last week said it expected its 2019 sales to grow at a slower rate than in 2018, although it expects core profit to grow faster than sales as it cuts costs.
In 2019, the WCA expects the U.S. cement market will grow by 3 percent, lower than the 4 percent rate in 2018, after President Donald Trump's large infrastructure investments failed to materialize. 
Demand in Germany is expected to remain flat, while political uncertainty in Italy will likely hit demand there, the WCA said.

Turkey will see a significant downturn, it added, while Saudi Arabia and Malaysia will also see reduced cement demand.

The plan, which is to be set on a voluntary basis, would affect human resources, IT, and finances among others, Thierry Bodin, with the CGT union said. In addition, 80 IT jobs are to be outsourced, he said. 
The group had said in September it would continue to implement cost savings after having reached a 1.5 billion euros ($1.70 billion) cost reduction target a year ahead of expectations.
A Sanofi spokesman confirmed the company's intention to shed 670 jobs out of a 25,000 workforce in France and said the plan was to be completed by the end of 2020.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Barclays to keep Swiss private banking growth momentum in 2019,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - Britain's  Barclays  (L:BARC) expects to have grown its Swiss private banking business by more than 10 percent this year and is looking to expand further in Switzerland in 2019.
Barclays embarked on an international hiring spree across its wealth management division last year, targeting more business from a growing pool of millionaires and billionaires.
And the bank is now looking to recruit more relationship managers, product specialists and investment experts in Zurich and Geneva after business in Switzerland grew better than expected in 2018, its Swiss head Gerald Mathieu told Reuters.
Barclays, which has around 300 employees across private and investment banking in Switzerland, plans to add six to 10 relationship managers, the money-earners who attract and serve customers in wealth management, in the year ahead. 
""When you look at the market, there's a league that starts at 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.1 billion) in assets under management and credits,"" Mathieu said, adding that Barclays is now more than three quarters of the way to that mark. 
""With the progress and momentum we have with clients, Barclays is already well on the way to achieving this goal over a short to medium-term timeframe,"" he added.
Barclays has carved out a niche among British and Middle Eastern clients looking to book money in Switzerland, and sees room to expand its onshore business for ultra-wealthy expats who are familiar with the bank's brand and British heritage.
""We are able to provide access to our investment and corporate bank, which makes a big difference when meeting ultra high net worth individuals and entrepreneurs,"" said Mathieu.
The banker, who previously led Barclays' international private banking out of Monaco, said uncertainty over Brexit could also prove a boost to the Swiss business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in UK housebuilders bounced off two-year lows on Wednesday as investors and traders covered bearish bets ahead of next week's vote on Prime Minister May's Brexit deal.
The bounce didn't signal a sudden change of mind from the market over the challenges facing housebuilders in an economy hurt by the decision to exit the European Union, but rather an acknowledgement that they may not have much further to fall, traders said.
FTSE 100 housebuilders Berkeley Group (L:BKGH), Barratt Development (L:BDEV),  Persimmon  (L:PSN), and  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) jumped 3.9 to 6.5 percent, topping the FTSE 100 (FTSE) leader board. 
Among mid-caps, housebuilders  Bovis Homes  (L:BVS),  Crest Nicholson  (L:CRST),  Bellway  (L:BWY), and  Redrow  (L:RDW) jumped 3.7 to 7 percent. 
Earlier in the session, the housebuilding sector (FTNMX3720) was at its lowest level since December 2016, down 16.2 percent this year against a 10 percent fall in the FTSE 350. In afternoon trade, it was up 0.2 percent.
With next Tuesday's vote on Prime Minister May's Brexit deal looming, short sellers in the shares may be unwinding their positions ahead of the vote, banking their gains as they bet the prices may not have much further to fall.
Housebuilders' shares are currently pricing in earnings-per-share cuts of 26 to 35 percent,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday, which they said reflects a fall of up to 8 percent in house prices and a 30 percent reduction in transactions in the housing market. 
In the Bank of England's ""disorderly"" Brexit scenario, the central bank said house prices could fall by 30 percent.
What some see as a higher probability of Tuesday's vote ultimately yielding a ""no Brexit"" outcome also helped boost the shares which have been under pressure since the Brexit vote. 
JP Morgan analysts upped their estimated probability of ""no Brexit"" to 40 percent from 20 percent on Wednesday.
Speculation the Bank of England would step in to support housebuilders could also be helping them.
""People might well think that the government will pump money into the economy, in which case construction and housebuilding are fairly obvious areas to go,"" said Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management. 
With valuations nearly at their lows hit just after the Brexit vote, and dividend yields among the highest in the FTSE 350, housebuilders also look attractive to income investors willing to stomach the risk.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>","Glencore, Trafigura, Vitol bribed Petrobras staff: Brazil prosecutors","By Pedro Fonseca and Marcelo Rochabrun
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Trading giants Vitol, Trafigura and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) paid over $30 million in bribes to employees at state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil prosecutors said on Wednesday, in a graft scheme they believe is ongoing.
Top executives of the international companies had ""total and unequivocal"" knowledge of the graft scheme, which began in 2009, investigators said at a news conference in Brazil, adding that the details being made public were just the ""tip of the iceberg."" 
Petrobras employees offered the trading companies lower prices for oil and its derivatives as well as storage tanks in more than 160 separate operations then shared in the savings, authorities said. 
""Evidence shows that there was a scheme in which the companies investigated paid bribes to Petrobras employees to obtain ... more advantageous prices and sign contracts more frequently,"" prosecutors said in a statement. 
They said the bribes moved through bank accounts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, among other nations, raising questions of whether those countries would open investigations.
Brazilian police alerted Interpol, seeking the arrest of a Petrobras employee in Houston.
Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of corruption.
""... We are the most interested party in seeing all the facts come to light,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will continue adopting all necessary measures to obtain a proper reparation for damages caused (to Petrobras)."" 
Spokesmen for the Glencore, Trafigura and Petrobras declined to comment. A Vitol spokesman said the firm ""has a zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption and will always cooperate fully with the relevant authorities in any jurisdiction in which it operates."" 
The latest revelations are the strongest international links yet made public to the sweeping ""Car Wash"" probe, which is centered on political graft at Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil firm is known. U.S. prosecutors say the investigation has uncovered the biggest-ever corruption scheme.
Over 130 top businessmen and politicians have been convicted in connection with the case in Brazil, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. 
'STRENGTHEN CREDIBILITY'
The latest developments hit just as the oil giant was hoping to turn the page on corruption. 
In September, Petrobras settled corruption charges for $850 million with Brazilian and U.S. authorities. 
Separately on Wednesday it launched a new business plan saying its goal is to ""strengthen the credibility, pride and reputation of Petrobras.""
The latest Car Wash chapter could undermine Petrobras' deals and ability to embark on privatization plans that Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's economy team wants to carry out.
Petrobras said a month ago it is selling its 50 percent stake in a Nigerian oil and gas exploration venture to a consortium led by Vitol for $1.53 billion as the state-controlled oil company reduces debt.
The deal has not yet closed and it was unclear how Wednesday's action may affect it. 
It was not the first time prosecutors have zeroed in on Trafigura, a commodities trading giant based in Geneva. 
In March this year, a former top Trafigura executive, Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, was found guilty of bribing a Petrobras executive on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was sentenced to over 10 years in jail.

Swiss prosecutors also have an ongoing related investigation, announced one month after Ferraz's arrest in Brazil in 2016. The Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland had opened a criminal probe into an employee of Trafigura as part of a wider investigation into suspected corruption at Petrobras. It did not name the employee.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:45AM ET</span>",Hoarding for Brexit sparks race for warehouse space in Britain,"By Kate Holton
LEIGHTON BUZZARD, England (Reuters) - In a vast warehouse complex 40 miles north of London, staff are wrestling with ways to cram in more goods after a surge in demand from companies building stockpiles ahead of Brexit.
Efforts at Miniclipper Logistics to add new racks by narrowing the aisles are being duplicated across Britain as Brexit contingency plans spark a race for storage space. The company, which after adding a mezzanine floor and a temporary warehouse has 300,000 square feet of capacity, has already had to turn new business away. 
""Almost every day we receive another inquiry regarding Brexit,"" Sales Director Jayne Masters told Reuters. ""We have customers queuing up to move goods in.""
The world's fifth-largest economy risks stumbling into a disorderly exit from its biggest trading partner, the European Union, if parliament votes down Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement on Dec. 11. 
Business leaders fear that would lead to border checks, blocked ports and major tailbacks on the roads, threatening the $540 billion worth of goods that move back and forth between the two and damaging major companies such as GSK and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR).
As a result, companies from Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and Airbus to retailers, manufacturers and food and drink groups have all said they are building up stock ahead of Brexit on March 29. A closely watched industry survey showed stockpiling was one factor driving output in November. 
But in an economy built on production cycles that run to the minute, and where storing stock wastes time and money, warehousing is in short supply and prices are rising. 
Owners of frozen and chilled storage space say they are fully booked until the middle of next year. And the government has had to request more secure storage for medication be built after it discovered that an order for all drugmakers to hold six weeks of supply could not be met.
""This is introducing extreme stress into the system,"" Mike Thompson, head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), told Reuters. 
STRONG DEMAND 
According to the Bank of England, large corporates are more active than small in preparing for up to a month of disruption. 
Companies are seeking space for around six months to one year, enough to see them through Britain's departure, but much less than the normal contracts of five years.
And the type of space is also changing. Where firms normally want racks so they can access components as needed, many now want them removed so they can bulk-stack finished product from the floor up.
Adrian Colman, the head of Britain's largest logistics firm Wincanton, said customers started asking for extra space around three months ago to store finished product, spare parts for their factories and raw materials including packaging. 
With around 20 million square feet of warehouse space under control in the UK, Colman has never seen such a collective move by manufacturers to secure storage. ""Companies are trying to do what they can without breaking the bank,"" he said. 
Charlie Pool, head of online warehouse marketplace Stowga, says there is enough ambient storage in Britain. It just might not be in the right location, increasing costs for business. 
""Any company that dithers is increasing their costs,"" he said. ""They may not end up in the right location, and prices are going up."" 
According to Stowga, the national average price has risen from around 1.85 pounds per pallet per week in September to over 2 pounds now. In London, that price is much higher. Where Stowga traditionally dealt with small and medium-sized companies, in the last month they've been working with big household names. 
The surge in demand for storage space, spurred by a groundswell of protest against May's deal in parliament, has coincided with the Christmas rush.
One Miniclipper warehouse was 99.9 percent full last month. Reaching 15 meters up to the eaves, it holds pallets of air conditioning equipment, sportswear, toiletries and health foods. 
As much of that moves out for Christmas, customers are booked to move Brexit stockpiles in. Masters said that while businesses traditionally used one logistics provider, they were now ringing around multiple sites to find space. ""We haven't ever had this many inquires for new business,"" she said.
LACK OF SUPPLY
Backers of Brexit have always accepted that the economy would take an initial hit as it embarks on the biggest shift in foreign and trade policy since World War Two, but say it will benefit from new trade deals in the long run. 
For British businesses however, preparation has been frustrated by the fact they will not know the terms of any post-Brexit trade deal until close to the departure date.
Wincanton's Colman said six months ago clients felt there were too many potential outcomes to prepare for. While that uncertainty remains, they now have to act. 
But around London and in central England it is becoming hard to find enough vacant space after developers focused in recent years on building warehouses for e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and supermarket  Tesco  (LON:TSCO). 
Real estate partner Catherine Fearnhead at Addleshaw Goddard said e-commerce take up had been so rapid that firms once relying on a major distribution site in central England now need bases around the country to guarantee faster deliveries.
Developers have in recent years converted multistory carparks into distribution centers, secured planning permission to build one major site underground and are increasingly building warehouses alongside residential estates, to secure both planning permission and workers for the facility.
The focus on e-commerce means the industry has failed to build enough speculative warehousing to be leased by multiple tenants, the type of space that is required now. Real estate group Savills says there is around 28 million square feet of vacant space in 2018, compared with 94 million in 2009.
Commercial real estate group Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) owns one of the few major empty warehouses near Heathrow Airport, Britain's largest port by value. Cargo 777 is a recently refurbished, gleaming white, grey and black 81,000 square foot site that is likely to be let to a logistics provider. 
""We are seeing people take extra space on the basis that it is going to take longer to get goods through the airport,"" said Melinda Cross, JLL's director of Industrial and Logistics. 
""That is due to Brexit and people are making plans for that now. They're getting ready. Everyone is having to crack on.""

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:33AM ET</span>",Takeda clears key hurdle as investors back $59 billion Shire deal,"By Takashi Umekawa
OSAKA (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) has won shareholder approval for its $59 billion takeover of London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP), creating a global powerhouse that has a stronger drugs pipeline but is also saddled with massive debt.
Takeda will be joining the ranks of the world's top 10 drugmakers and gaining expertise in rare diseases through the deal, the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company.
It will also become one of the most indebted. In addition to issuing new shares, the company has secured $30.9 billion in bank loans.
The company's high debt levels were a top concern for Takeda shareholders who gathered at an extraordinary meeting in Osaka, western Japan, although almost 90 percent of them voted to approve the deal as expected.
""I want to keep my Takeda shares into the future, but now I am worried about further declines in the share price,"" said Satoshi Ito, a 75-year-old shareholder. He abstained from voting.
Separate meetings of Shire shareholders later on Wednesday also secured overwhelming support for the transaction. 
Takeda shares have fallen around 25 percent since the drugmaker revealed its interest in the acquisition in March. They closed up 1 percent at 4,240 yen on Wednesday.
Shire shares gained 3.2 percent to 46.95 pounds on relief Takeda's board had won its nine-month battle to persuade shareholders of the merits of the tie-up. 
The acquisition is expected to close on Jan. 8. It now only requires sanctioning at a court hearing expected to be held on Jan. 3.
DEBTS, DESCENDANTS AND DIVESTITURES
A small group of Takeda investors, including descendants of the company's founder, had actively opposed the deal.
""We are definitely against this because the financial risks are too great and the expected benefits are quite limited,"" said Kazuhisa Takeda, a former director of the drugmaker and a member of the founding family, ahead of the meeting. 
""I think M&A is quite necessary for Takeda's future but Shire is not the answer."" 
Chief Executive Christophe Weber has promised to turn the deal profitable by slashing costs. It predicts annual savings of at least $1.4 billion three years after completion, and expects to boost underlying earnings significantly from the first full year after closing. 
Takeda also has a plan to sell up to $10 billion worth of non-core assets to pay back debt. Andy Plump, Takeda's global head of R&D, told Reuters that accelerated deleveraging was needed to keep its credit rating at a safe level.
""We have a plan for divestiture that gets us to a place in three to five years that our credit agencies are OK with. Our credit rating is likely to tick down a notch, but still above junk bond status, which is critical for us,"" he said in an interview.
Analysts have said it may be difficult to integrate the two companies. Toshiba's (T:6502) acquisition of Westinghouse over a decade ago and Japan Post Holdings' (T:6178) $4.9 billion bet on Toll Holdings are widely seen as examples of many Japanese companies having paid high valuations in cross-border deals only to face massive write-downs later.
But they also said Takeda has little choice but to seek growth abroad, with industry pressure to gain access to cutting-edge treatments amid declining revenue from older drugs that must compete with cheaper generics. 
Even with the acquisition of Shire, some said Takeda will need to bolster its lineup of experimental therapies to compete in the longer term. 
Shire's hemophilia business, for example, is already starting to face strong pressure from a competing drug being marketed by Roche (S:ROG) as well as new gene therapies now in development. 
""It's crucial whether the drugmaker can reinvest profits from the deal into seeds for developing future drugs,"" said Kazuaki Hashiguchi, a senior drugs analyst at Daiwa Securities.

""The benefits of the deal will last for a limited time, as no treatments can avoid patent expiration.""

LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank's top investors are looking to Denmark's Maersk family to steer the country's largest lender through the turmoil of a 200 billion euro ($227 billion) money laundering scandal.
The Danish clan's investment firm A.P. Moller Holding, Danske's normally passive top shareholder with a stake of around 21 percent, has ousted the bank's chairman Ole Andersen and called an extraordinary shareholder meeting in Copenhagen on Friday to nominate two successors to the board.
Given the depth of the crisis at Danske Bank and the threat of regulatory penalties, some are relieved at A.P. Moller Holding's new activist approach.
""They're saying: 'screw this. We need to sort this out; we can't sit on the sidelines being passive money',"" one of Danske Bank's top 30 investors said on condition of anonymity.
A.P. Moller Holding says it hopes for ""broad support"" for its nominations at Friday's meeting.
Its aim is to build a team with the authority to choose a replacement for former chief executive Thomas Borgen who resigned in September after admitting that Danske's Estonian branch helped funnel hundreds of billions of euros from countries such as Russia over more than eight years.
The threat of a heavy fine from the U.S. Department of Justice, which is investigating alongside Danish, Estonian and British authorities, has sent Danske's shares plunging almost 50 percent since March, erasing around $15 billion of market value and raising the prospect of legal action.
Nearly half a dozen groups have announced plans to gather shareholders and claim damages, although none has filed a case.
""RIGHT CANDIDATE""
A.P. Moller Holding is proposing to nominate Karsten Dybvad, CEO of the Danish confederation of industry, and Jan Thorsgaard Nielsen, its own chief investment officer, as chairman and vice chairman respectively to steady Danske Bank's board.
Several top investors contacted by Reuters said they would approve the nominations, which have already been backed by the board, although one complained they had been unable to reach Danske Bank's depleted board directly.
""They (Danske) need to understand that they have to open up and talk to their shareholders,"" said the investor, who ranks among Danske's top 10, but declined to be named. ""Under the usual corporate governance, you speak to the board,"" he added.
Claus Ingar Jensen, Danske Bank's head of investor relations, said it has been ""in continued contact"" with large and small investors over the last months and answered all questions - as well as participating in public hearings in Danish and European parliaments.
Danske Bank supports the board nominations, although it does not back a third candidate, shareholder and engineer Arne Bostrom, who has also put himself forward for election.
Allan Polack, group chief executive of Danish pension fund PFA, which holds around 1.0 billion Danish crowns ($153 million)of Danske shares, says Dybvad is the ""right candidate"" to lead Danske and restore investor, customer and public confidence.
""We believe that the bank, under the right management, can move forward and remain a pivotal financial institution in Denmark's society,"" he said.
Henrik Didner, founder of Swedish fund house Didner & Gerge and Danske's third-biggest shareholder - according to Refinitiv Eikon data - is also supportive and said he planned to meet people ""connected to"" Danske in due course.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 09:48AM ET</span>",JP Morgan targets mid-sized firms in challenge to European banks,"By Inti Landauro and David Henry
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thumbing through a thick binder detailing European mid-sized and family-owned firms, JP Morgan's (N:JPM) Doug Petno has his sights set on a business Europe's banks have kept to themselves.
""This list is heavily curated, handpicked,"" Petno, the New York-based CEO of JP Morgan's commercial banking segment, told Reuters of the 1,500 companies it wants to become clients.
The owners of these firms are often already wealth management customers and JP Morgan's Petno is now looking to offer their businesses loans, cash management, payment processing and other banking services.
JP Morgan's challenge to the European banks in their traditional stronghold is another example of the U.S. bank using its clout to try to take business from competitors, after holding up much better than many during the financial crisis.
JP Morgan is now targeting companies in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain, with roughly $500 million to $2 billion in annual revenue from recognized brands and long-established business, plus international aspirations.
Some already have businesses in the United States and use JP Morgan there, while many are known by its European investment bankers while out on the hunt for deals. The move comes as JP Morgan shifts dozens of bankers to Paris to adapt to Brexit. 
Petno's prospect list was two years in the making and built by those responsible for JP Morgan's affairs in each country.
While it will take time to win clients and recruit staff, Petno is convinced that JP Morgan can build a sustainable business in Europe similar to its commercial bank in the United States, which last year produced $8.6 billion of revenue.
MARKET SHARE 
Petno declined to reveal his goals, but JP Morgan's expansion comes as corporate lending is a rare bright spot for Europe's banks amid rock-bottom interest rates and weak growth.
In the first half of this year, the four top investment banks in continental Europe ranked by the size of the deals they have advised on are U.S. banks, data from Refinitiv shows.
A combination of price cuts, product range and additional marketing have won JP Morgan market share in European capital markets, U.S. credit cards, commercial lending, asset management and securities services in recent years.
But Francois-Xavier Deucher, Fitch Ratings' director for Financial Institutions in Paris, said it won't be easy for a bank without a dense branch network to make headway in Europe.
""The profitable part of the business lies in services like cash management, rates or forex hedging, advisory, insurance or employee savings plans,"" Deucher said.
""On export financing and on support on international markets, JP Morgan could have a competitive advantage,"" he said.
With $2.6 trillion in assets, about a quarter of which are outside North America, JPMorgan's balance sheet is much larger than Europe's biggest banks. Its $24 billion net profit dwarfed BNP Paribas' (PA:BNPP) 7.8 billion euro net profit in 2017.

Profit last year at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), continental Europe's second and fourth largest banks by assets, were 6.5 billion euros and 6.6 billion euros, while Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) was 1.3 billion euros.

Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month that a decision on the leadership of the joint venture would be made before Christmas.
""If not then we'll make trouble,"" Tekin Nasikkol, who heads the works council of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, told reporters on Wednesday.
""There is a lot to talk about, but we don't have anyone to talk to,"" Nasikkol said. ""I have to strongly condemn this.""
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel unveiled plans in June to combine their European steel units to form the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal (AS:MT).
Nasikkol said the decision on the entity's leadership should have been made months ago.
The joint venture, to be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, will have a two-tier leadership structure: a management board and a supervisory board, each with six members, on which both companies will be equally represented.

Former  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) executive Andreas Goss, who has been heading Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe since 2014, is seen as one of the top candidates to lead the combined entity.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 09:45AM ET</span>","Petrobras plans to raise $26.9 billion with asset sales, partnering","SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) plans to raise some $26.9 billion via asset sales and partnerships by 2023 while boosting investments on the front edge of an anticipated production boom in Brazil.
Petrobras intends to make $84.1 billion in investments from 2019 to 2023, above the $74.5 billion forecast in its 2018 to 2022 plan, it said in a five-year investment program unveiled on Wednesday morning.
Petrobras is trying to stay the course on efforts to reduce one of the heftiest debt loads among oil companies worldwide - $88 billion in gross debt - through divestments and an investment focus on Brazil's coveted offshore pre-salt area.
""The strategic plan came within the expectations of the market, a reasonable increase in oil prices, with important refining divestments and an ambitious leverage target,"" said Adriano Pires, a consultant at Brazil's Center for Infrastructure.
While the plan appeared to contain no major surprises, it was released just as prosecutors in Brazil alleged that trading giants Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], and  Glencore  (L:GLEN) paid over $30 million in bribes to Petrobras employees.
The allegations are another black eye for Petrobras, which has been at the center of Brazil's sprawling ""Car Wash"" corruption investigations, and the firm is eager to clean up its image.
Preferred Brazil-listed shares in Petrobras fell 1 percent in morning trade, while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index (BVSP) were little changed.
Whether or not the company sticks to the plan, Pires added, will depend on the incoming government of right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro.
""The challenge of the next government is to maintain this plan,"" he said.
Bolsonaro, a former lawmaker and military officer, last month named Roberto Castello Branco, a University of Chicago-trained economist, to succeed current Chief Executive Officer Ivan Monteiro, who is set to step down on Jan. 1.
While Castello Branco has said he favors selling noncore assets, some of the generals close to Bolsonaro, who see the oil company as a ""strategic asset,"" may put the brakes on any radical restructuring bid.
Petrobras will maintain its focus on deepwater exploration and production, particularly in Brazil's coveted pre-salt blocks, an offshore area where billions of barrels are locked beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean. Some 56 percent of its production-related investments would go to pre-salt,
The oil company also disclosed its return on invested capital should be above 11 percent in 2020, as it sells assets and cuts debt.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",CVS offers 'guaranteed net cost' for pharmacy benefit clients,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) on Wednesday said as of Jan. 1 it will offer a new prescription benefit option guaranteeing its health plan clients 100 percent of any rebates, discounts or other fees paid by drugmakers.
The new plan model is aimed at providing greater drug cost simplicity, predictability and transparency, CVS said. 
The ""guaranteed net cost"" option could also deflect growing criticism that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) reap gains off the widening gap between pharmaceutical list prices and their lower net cost after hefty rebates paid by drugmakers to secure coverage and access to their products.
President Donald Trump, who has promised lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers, earlier this year singled out industry ""middlemen"", such as PBMs and insurers, and the common practice of drugmakers offering rebates to them.
PBMs like CVS' Caremark unit make a profit by using their scale to negotiate drug prices and by providing cost-management strategies to health plans. Under its new option, CVS takes on the risk of drug price inflation and shifts in drug use - at least for the term of each contract.
The new model guarantees average spending per prescription across each distribution channel – retail, mail order and specialty pharmacy, Derica Rice, president of CVS Caremark, said in an interview. 
Rival PBM Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co last month announced a new drug coverage list aimed at accommodating reduced prices for brand-name drugs as a way to encourage drugmakers to move away from paying rebates after a prescription is filled.
Trump Administration officials have also suggested ending the rebate practice. 
""If rebates go away, this model accommodates that,"" Rice said. ""But as long as we get to the lowest net cost we are indifferent."" 
He said plan sponsors still have the option to choose whether to pass on any rebates to patients at the pharmacy counter.
CVS said it is first offering the net cost model to employer-sponsored plans, but will eventually make it available to all clients, including government health plans.
Rice said both existing and new clients have already chosen to adopt the net cost model next year, but he declined to estimate how many clients were expected to make the switch.
The company, which last week completed its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET), said it hopes that other PBMs will shift to similar net cost pricing models, allowing clients the ability to assess the net cost of their pharmacy benefit and select a PBM based on that criteria.

CHANDLER, Ariz. (Reuters) - Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Waymo on Wednesday launched a significant development in its costly, decade-long quest for autonomous transportation: self-driving taxis that actually generate fares.
With little fanfare, the company has begun charging passengers to use its driverless vehicles in a roughly 100-mile (160 km) zone in four Phoenix suburbs - Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert - where it has been testing its technology since 2016.
Producing revenue is a strategic milestone, putting Waymo ahead of U.S. rivals, primarily General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], which have yet to launch their own paid self-driving services. All are racing to win customers and recoup billions spent developing the technology.
To use Waymo's service, dubbed Waymo One, riders must download an app and provide a credit card number, similar to ridesharing services Uber and Lyft. A human driver will be behind the wheel, but only to intervene in case of emergency. 
Major challenges remain, starting with technical hurdles. A Waymo One taxi tested by Reuters last week proved slow and jerky at times. Whether customers will continue using the service once the novelty wears off remains to be seen. Regulations governing the industry across the country are an incoherent patchwork, a significant hurdle to fast expansion.
Waymo would not say exactly how many of its cars would be on the road in Arizona. It said its around-the-clock service initially would be limited to ""hundreds"" of people invited to sign up last year. For now, pricing is roughly in line with that of Uber and Lyft. A 15-minute, 3-mile (4.8 km) drive taken by Reuters last week cost $7.59, just above the $7.22 offered by Lyft.
""Over time, we hope to make Waymo One available to even more members of the public,"" Chief Executive John Krafcik wrote in a blog on Wednesday. ""Self-driving technology is new to many, so we're proceeding carefully."" 
The company has been testing its driverless cars for a decade. Its fleet, now numbering 600 vehicles, has logged more than 10 million miles on public roads in and around 25 U.S. cities. Alphabet does not disclose its total investment, but industry experts put that sum at well over $1 billion. 
Monetizing driverless technology has been slow going. A handful of startups, including Boston-based Optimus Ride, have managed to win contracts providing self-driving services in enclosed, low-speed environments such as business parks and retirement communities.
Launching taxi service on the streets of metro Phoenix underscores Waymo's big ambitions, said Ryan Chin, co-founder and chief executive of Optimus Ride.
""If you're going to invest that much capital and time and engineering, you have to go for these larger robotaxi markets,"" Chin said. ""You may start in the smaller markets but the bigger goal is to go for the big fish.""
Klaus Froehlich, BMW's global head of development, said Waymo's move puts pressure on all robotaxi hopefuls to move quickly to grab market share before others enter the game.
That strategy has been key in ridesharing, where first movers such as San Francisco-based Uber and China's Didi Chuxing have proven tough to dislodge in many cities where they operate. Driverless vehicles are the next step in the race to shape urban mobility.
""Waymo is now accelerating ... because if they wait two or three years longer they will get overtaken,"" Froehlich said on the sidelines of last week's Los Angeles auto show. ""So they have to move early, even though that's quite a risky thing for them."" 
""GOOD AFTERNOON, WAYMO RIDER""
Waymo invited Reuters to ride in a white Chrysler Pacifica hybrid modified with the company's technology through the streets of Chandler, Ariz., a city about 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Phoenix. A dome-shaped sensor atop the car was the primary clue that this was no ordinary vehicle.
Inside, a safety driver sat at the wheel, with a Waymo representative in the front passenger seat. Two video screens built into the seatbacks, facing the backseat passengers, read ""Good afternoon, Waymo Rider."" The monitors showed the car's trajectory, and contained touchscreen buttons that could be tapped to summon an outside Waymo operator with any questions.
The drive took place on city streets with moderate traffic on wide, well-paved roads on a relatively clear day. But even in these favorable conditions, Waymo's technology performed much like a student driver: slow and timid. 
The vehicle was hyper-aware of pedestrians and had trouble distinguishing their intentions. For example, it stopped for a man standing at a crosswalk talking on his cellphone even though it was clear that he was not going to cross the street.
The car slowed well ahead of stop signs and drove at a snail's pace over speed bumps. Yet it sometimes executed lane changes with an unsettling jerk as an automated voice over the speaker system called out ""left"" or ""right."" That is a feature Waymo says helps riders understand what the car is doing.
Other maneuvers came off without a hitch, including one of the trickiest: crossing three lanes of oncoming traffic to execute a left turn into a parking lot.
The safety driver never touched the wheel during the entire drive. Waymo says it will phase out these human minders eventually, but has given no timeline for doing so.
Navigating an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment could prove even more challenging. 
Arizona has fewer regulations on self-driving cars than most states, a major factor in Waymo's decision to launch there. The rest of the country is a jumble of sometimes contradictory requirements. Federal guidance has yet to arrive.
A bill that would speed the use of self-driving cars without human controls has been stalled in the U.S. Senate for over a year. Meanwhile, rules on key issues such as data, privacy, liability and cyber security are still undecided. 
For now, Waymo says it is focused on the Phoenix area, where it hopes to gain valuable insights into supply and demand, as it awaits decisions from regulators.

1135,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",It’s the Worst Time in Decades to Make Money in Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Market statisticians are falling over each other in 2018 to describe the pain being felt across asset classes. One venerable shop frames it this way: Things haven’t been this bad since Richard Nixon’s presidency.
Ned Davis Research puts markets into eight big asset classes — everything from bonds to U.S. and international stocks to commodities. And not a single one of them is on track to post a return this year of more than 5 percent, a phenomenon last observed in 1972, according to Ed Clissold, a strategist at the firm.
In terms of losses, investors have seen far worse. But going by the breadth of assets failing to deliver upside, 2018 is starting to look historic.
Nothing’s working, not large or small-cap stocks in the U.S., not international or emerging equities, not Treasuries, investment-grade bonds, commodities or real estate. Most of them are down, and the ones that are up are doing so by percentages in the low single-digits.
That’s all but unique in history. Normally when something falls, something else gains. Amid the financial catastrophe of 2008, Treasuries rallied. In 1974, commodities were a bright spot. In 2002, it was REITs. In 2018, there’s nowhere to run.
Clissold has a villain: evaporating central bank stimulus.
“Overhanging the markets have been concerns over how asset prices would handle the removal of ultra-easing monetary policies,” Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research, said in a note published last week. During previous instances of market turbulence, “there was a bull market somewhere.”
The Federal Reserve has hiked rates eight times since 2015, and policy makers in Europe and Japan are slowly winding down their accommodative programs. That along with global growth concern has soured investor sentiment across the board.
This week, optimism over a temporary trade-war truce between the U.S. and China proved short-lived as concerns from Brexit to a flattening yield curve to a global growth slowdown took hold. Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index posted its fifth drop of more than 3 percent this year.
All told, the S&P 500 Index is up 1 percent for the year and U.S. investment-grade debt has lost 1.6 percent. Developing-nation stocks have dropped 12 percent, while the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Long Term U.S. Treasury Total Return Index is down 6.4 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog is being taken to court over its handling of an investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) restructuring unit which has been criticized for its treatment of small businesses after the 2008 financial crisis.
Scottish businessman and frequent RBS critic Neil Mitchell has filed an application for a judicial review into the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) decision not to sanction any executives of the bank's Global Restructuring Group (GRG), according to court documents seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The case has the potential to reopen one of the longest-running and most painful sagas in the bank's recent history, which has seen RBS criticized by lawmakers and forced to set up a 400 million pound ($511 million) compensation scheme over its treatment of small businesses.
The FCA found, in a much-delayed report into the GRG unit's actions published in February, that there was ""widespread inappropriate treatment of customers"" and that its bosses chased profits at the expense of distressed businesses.
The full report was published by lawmakers after the FCA refused to do so.
In July the watchdog said it did not have the power to discipline any bosses involved for misconduct, arguing the business of GRG fell outside the scope of its regulatory remit.
It is that decision not to punish any bankers that Mitchell's application is seeking to review, the court documents show.
""We will not comment on the application seeking to review this decision while it is pending,"" a spokesman for the FCA said.
RBS declined to comment. The bank has in the past rejected the most serious allegations against its GRG unit, but accepted some wrongdoing.
Mitchell has separately formed a company which will seek to manage claims against the bank brought by more than 500 former business customers of the GRG unit, he said in a statement to media on Wednesday.
A high court judge last year dismissed a lawsuit Mitchell brought against RBS for its handling of his own former business Torex Retail. Mitchell said he would appeal the ruling.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) wants to represent riders in the north London area of Camden, hoping to secure rights such as the minimum wage, which they are not currently entitled to, due to being classified as self-employed.
Firms such as Uber in the gig economy - where many people work for multiple employers without fixed contracts - have lost court cases in recent years over workplace rights. 
But on Wednesday the High Court dismissed a claim for judicial review made by the IWGB, in a move welcomed by Deliveroo. 
“The Court also carefully examined the question under European law and concluded riders are self-employed,"" said the company's UK Managing Director Dan Warne. 
""This a victory for riders who have consistently told us the flexibility to choose when and where they work, which comes with self-employment, is their number-one reason for riding with Deliveroo."" 
The IWGB union said it would appeal the verdict.
""Deliveroo riders should be entitled to basic worker rights as well as to the ability to be represented by trade unions to negotiate pay and terms and conditions,"" said General Secretary Jason Moyer-Lee. 

""The IWGB will appeal this decision and continue to fight for these rights until we are victorious.""

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>","World stocks sideswiped by Wall Street, U.S. yield curve double whammy","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks tumbled to one-week lows on Wednesday, as declines by long-dated U.S. bond yields and a renewal of trade concerns stoked fears of a downturn in the United States, the world's largest economy.
U.S. markets are closed to mark former President George H.W. Bush's death, but the effect of Wall Street's turmoil in the previous session, when New York-listed shares tumbled more than 3 percent, was felt in Asia and Europe.
That pushed MSCI's all-country index down 0.4 percent. (MIWD00000PUS) 
Tuesday's declines came just a day after an equity surge driven by optimism that China and the United States would sort out their trade dispute. Then President Donald Trump threatened ""major tariffs"" on Chinese imports if his administration failed to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. 
""As I look into next year, most expectations for further gains have been pared back. Investors have gone from extended bullishness at the start of the year on equities to an uncomfortable neutrality,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson.
Trump's comments, alongside the drop in U.S. stocks and bond yields, pushed Asian shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) 1.5 percent lower. Shanghai markets (SSEC) fell 0.6 percent, their losses limited by Chinese officials expressing confidence that a trade deal would be clinched on time.
But European losses were trimmed as the session continued, with a pan-European index (STOXX) down 0.75 percent by 1145 GMT compared with falls of over one percent earlier. 
Global equities have been shaken by fears of a recession, fanned by the flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve -- a phenomenon in which longer-dated debt yields fall faster than their shorter-dated counterparts.
Such an inversion of two-year and 10-year yields, when 10-year bonds yield less than their two-year debt, has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
""The market decline in the U.S. overnight and the flattening of the yield curve reflect that economic growth momentum is taking over as the primary concern for investors,"" Tai Hui, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management told clients.
So far, 10-year yields are clinging to an 11-basis-point margin over the two-year, although it was the smallest one in over a decade .
Graphic: US Treasury yield curve - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RAJIgP
The flattening of the curve gained momentum after last week's signal by the Federal Reserve that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate-increase cycle. It has spread to the euro zone, where the German 2-10 yield curve hit its flattest since mid-2017 at 85.70 basis points.
German 10-year yields slipped to six-month lows of 0.247 percent (DE10YT=RR) before rising back to 0.259 percent.
Italian bonds extended their rally, with two-year yields falling 10 bps to 4 1/2-month lows (IT2YT=RR) after a cabinet official raised hopes that the government could cut nearly four billion euros from its 2019 budget plans.
Markets are also bracing for more news on the Brexit front. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, the start of five days of parliamentary debate over her plans to leave the European Union.
The pound rose off 17-month lows of $1.2659  hit on Tuesday to around $1.2780, up 0.3 percent on the day, amid creeping optimism that Britain could opt to stay in the EU after all.
Economists at JP Morgan reckon the odds of Britain staying in the EU have increased to 40 percent from 20 percent previously, after the European Court of Justice's advocate general said Britain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice. 
The dollar has been undermined by the bond market moves and recession fears, but it has recovered from two-week lows against a basket of currencies (DXY) to trade around 97, 0.10 percent lower on the day.
It rose 0.1 percent to 112.9 yen  after losing 0.75 percent the previous day against the safe-haven Japanese currency.

The threat of slowing economic activity also weighed on oil prices, but Brent futures (LCOc1) trimmed losses to stand 0.4 percent lower at $61.8 per barrel. It had earlier fallen more than 1 percent.

First job: Caddie
I grew up in suburban Detroit, and my first job was as a caddie at the Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. I think I was 15, because I remember I couldn’t drive there on my own yet.
We got paid per bag, per round, plus a tip. My biggest payday was for doing two rounds in a day, both of which involved two bags, so I made $120. I was so excited that when I got home I showed my mom the burn marks on my shoulders, and slapped the cash down on the kitchen counter. I thought I was on top of the world.
My most memorable round was with a local doctor. I had been born with a birth defect of two fingers being stuck together. By chance, I caddied for the doctor who had done the separation procedure, and he recognized his own work when he saw my hand. He made me feel very special.
From that job, I learned that when you do something, give it absolutely everything you’ve got. Show up early, work twice as hard, stay late. I still remember how excited I was to get there early and be one of the first people on the course. A first job like that can shape your mindset about what success looks like. And as a son of an immigrant growing up in Detroit, it was my first time being exposed to a world like that.

First job: Pharmacy assistant
When I was a kid, our family moved to Reno so my dad and his business partner could open a family-run pharmacy. I grew up about a mile away from Keystone Pharmacy, which my father ran for many years. Everyone in Reno knew Frank.
He put up with me trailing him around the pharmacy for most of my childhood. Eventually I became a bookkeeper for the business. My brothers, meanwhile, used to drive around little yellow trucks to make deliveries.
A lot of people think Reno is a strange place to live and work, and I’ve heard every Reno joke there is. But it was actually a wonderful place to grow up, right by the Sierra Nevada mountains. It’s my happy place.

First job: Pizza delivery
My first unpaid job was actually helping my family build our house in Connecticut. At a very early age, I was working nights and weekends, building an addition for our growing family. In the third grade for Show & Tell, I told all my classmates about how to hang drywall.
My first paid job, though, was delivering pizza while I went to university at Bowdoin College in Maine. It required someone who was okay with not having a social life on Friday or Saturday nights, so that was me. I got paid $6 an hour, and the expectation was that there would be tips as well – but since I was mostly delivering to other college students, there wasn’t a lot of that.
I remember I had to drive a bronze Toyota van that spun out a lot, and beeped when you backed up. Mostly I delivered to frat houses, so that job forced me to get over my own embarrassment about driving a tacky van and wearing a hokey uniform and doing my job while other people were having fun.

It also taught me to manage my time. I was in neuroscience, and a college athlete, and working 35 hours a week so I could afford clothes and food and books. I had no choice but to be very efficient and thoughtful about how I spent my days.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn), which acquired seed company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) this year, reduced its combined sales estimate for its most promising experimental drugs, acknowledging it needs to do more to replenish the development pipeline.
At its capital markets day in London on Wednesday, it said the tally of peak sales potential of its five most promising drugs was more than 3.75 billion euros ($4.3 billion), compared with a target of more than 6 billion euros for the top six drugs reiterated as recently as June.
Bayer last week announced the sale of a number of businesses, around 12,000 job cuts and 3.3 billion euros in impairments.
Bayer faces a threat to revenues in 2024 when the patent on blockbuster heart drug Xarelto runs out. Sales from eye drug Eylea, its second-best selling drug, are expected to suffer from competing drugs before that.
Bayer said it halted trials testing its experimental uterine fibroids treatment vilaprisan, which it previously expected to generate peak annual sales of more than 1 billion euros, citing the risk of side effects.
It also no longer included a peak sales estimate for anetumab ravtansine, a drug for asbestos-linked cancer type mesothelioma, previously seen generating more than 2 billion euros in annual revenues.
The group's former head of pharmaceuticals, Dieter Weinand, said a year ago there was still hope for anetumab despite a setback in a Phase II trial in 2017, but Weinand quit and was replaced by Sanofi (PA:SASY) executive Stefan Oelrich last month.
Bayer added to the tally an annual peak sales potential of more than 750 million euros for larotrectinib against a variety of cancers driven by a rare genetic mutation. The drug, co-developed with Loxo Oncology (O:LOXO), won U.S. market approval last week.
Bayer said in presentation slides that it plans to supplement its existing pipeline with in-licensing and bolt-on takeover deals.
""We need to fill our mid-term pipeline furthermore"" over the next few years, Oelrich told investors at the event, adding that the early- and late-stage pipeline was strong.

Bayer also said it aimed to increase adjusted group core earnings to 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) in 2022, up from an expected 12.2 billion euros this year, but that target does not yet take into account the planned divestment of its animal health unit or the effect of currency swings.

China is the most important and historically the fastest growing market for Germany's carmakers but Chinese tariffs on German cars built in the United States have taken their toll.
""China is currently taking a breather"", said VDA president Bernhard Mattes in Berlin, adding the export of German cars from factories in the United States to China fell by a third in the first 10 months of the year.
The VDA said it expected the number of new vehicles in China to decline by 1 percent this year to 23.9 million. It forecast growth in 2019 of 2 percent to 24.4 million.
The association said it expected the global car market to reach 85 million new vehicles this year. In Europe, it expected the number of new vehicles to climb to 15.8 million in 2018 and remain at a similar level in 2019.
Sales of new cars in Germany will decline by 1 percent this year, it added.
Separately, the German auto importers association VDIK also forecast slightly weaker sales in Germany this year and said sales would probably remain at 2018 levels next year.

Some 3.42 million cars will probably be registered in 2018, the VDIK said, adding that this showed the new car market was performing well. VDIK members expect sales to rise by 1 percent to 1.325 million vehicles this year.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 06:29AM ET</span>","Hyundai, South Korea talks on low-cost carmaking JV hit snag","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) talks to build a low-cost carmaking factory with a local government suffered a setback on Wednesday as the South Korean automaker rejected proposed revisions to certain terms related to wage negotiations.
Hyundai and the southwestern city of Gwangju had reached a preliminary deal on Tuesday for the factory that included an annual wage of 35 million won ($31,492) for employees of the joint venture (JV), which is less than half of the average 92 million won that existing Hyundai workers earn.
The plan was given a green light by the city's consultative body on Wednesday on condition that Hyundai would revise certain terms that allow the JV to skip annual wage negotiations with its workers, a city official said.
Hyundai's existing workers hold wage talks every year and often resort to strikes to get a better pay. 
Hyundai rejected the city's revised proposals. 
""We hope Gwangju city will take actions to restore trust, so that we can proceed with investment discussions smoothly,"" the automaker said in a statement. 
The factory Hyundai and Gwangju are looking to build would have an annual capacity of 100,000 mini-SUVs starting 2021. The proposal, however, has raised tensions with Hyundai's unionized workers who fear the JV will lead to job losses and wage cuts.
The JV, a first for South Korea's biggest automaker, will help Hyundai cut both costs and reliance on unionized workers. 
It would also better align Hyundai with the government of President Moon Jae-in, which is struggling to keep manufacturing jobs from moving overseas amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose hefty tariffs on vehicle imports. 
Gwangju is home to Hyundai affiliate Kia Motors' (KS:000270) factories and the political stronghold of the liberal Moon government, which has made job creation its top election pledge.
Hyundai is expected to invest 53 billion won ($47.5 million)for a 19 percent stake in the JV, while Gwangju will spend 59 billion won for a 21 percent stake. The remaining 167 billion won will be provided by suppliers and the local economy.
""BAD JOBS""
The JV, which the city government said will create 12,000 jobs, has already met with disapproval from Hyundai and Kia labor unions. The unions said they will idle factories for four hours on Thursday.
Hyundai's more than 50,000-member union on Tuesday warned of a full strike, fearing the move may take away production and jobs from the company's plants in Ulsan and other cities.
Hundreds of union members wearing red headbands rallied at Hyundai's factories in the southeastern city of Ulsan with banners reading ""South Korea's auto industry will go bankrupt"". 
The project will lead to ""bad jobs which bring down workers' wages by half"", said Ha Bu-young, Hyundai's Korean union chief.
The labor union said an additional plant will exacerbate excess production capacity at the automaker, which is struggling with sluggish exports to the United States and other countries and posted a plunge in quarterly net profit.
Hyundai's Korean production fell to 1.65 million vehicles last year, the lowest since 2009, data from the country's car association shows. 
Kia's union has also called for a withdrawal of the JV plan, saying it will add pressure to the niche, shrinking mini-vehicle segment in which it holds a 69 percent share.

LONDON (Reuters) - Worries about U.S. bond markets signaling an impending recession, and a still rumbling trade war between the world's top two economies, sent European shares sinking further on Wednesday after a 3 percent drop on Wall Street.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) opened down 1.2 percent, hitting its lowest level since Nov. 23, but recovered some losses to trade down 0.9 percent by 0930 GMT.
Financials were the biggest drag on European shares as investors dumped sectors highly sensitive to economic growth. Europe's bank index (SX7P) fell 1.7 percent, while oil and mining sectors fell 1.5 percent each. (SXEP) (SXPP) 
""Cyclicals are really dependent upon accelerations in growth, they're very real economy sensitive for higher revenues,"" said John Ricciardi, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Kestrel Investment Partners. 
The inversion of parts of the U.S. yield curve means investors are beginning to panic about future growth and inflation, Ricciardi added. 
Analysts have cut their estimates for 2019 earnings growth as markets turned sour this autumn.
Tech (SX8P) stocks fell 1.4 percent after the highly valued U.S. tech sector sold off.
Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell 1.2 percent to 4.5 percent following a sharp drop in chip stocks on Wall Street. 
German carmakers outperformed the DAX as investors digested what seemed a relatively positive outcome from auto executives' meeting at the White House.
U.S. President Donald Trump pressed carmakers to increase investments in the United States, something the executives said they planned to do but wouldn’t be able to if the administration went ahead with threatened tariffs.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, among those in the meeting, said he did not think that car tariffs were imminent.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) were up 0.1 to 0.2 percent and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell just 0.2 percent. 
 Iliad  (PA:ILD) shares fell back, down 3.7 percent after a strong rally on Tuesday when it unveiled a new high-end set-up box.
Shares in valve manufacturers  Rotork  (L:ROR) and Weir (L:WEIR), which supply the oil industry, tumbled after U.S. energy services firm Schlumberger (N:SLB) gave a warning on Tuesday, saying a drop in fracking activity would hit its North America revenues.
Swedish pharma firm Elekta (ST:EKTAb) was a rare gainer, up 3.6 percent after it won Food & Drug Administration clearance for its ""Unity"" radiation therapy, clearing it for commercial sales and clinical use in the United States.
M&A news was also a driver.
Shares in  Shire  (L:SHP) jumped 4 percent at the open, then trimming gains to trade up 2 percent, after shareholders of Japan's Takeda approved the takeover of the London-listed pharmaceutical firm. 
Among small-caps, Swedish retailer Clas Ohlson (ST:CLASb) provided the latest example of the squeeze on the sector to close physical stores as shoppers switch to online. 
Its shares opened down 5 percent but swung back to rise 5 percent by 0930 GMT as investors welcomed its new strategy including closures of loss-making stores in Britain and Germany.
Broker notes hit some stocks.  Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV) fell 5.4 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut its rating to underweight. 
Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) shares fell 3 percent, the worst performer on the CAC 40, after JP Morgan cut it to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"".
Altran (PA:ALTT) shares fell 4.5 percent after the company announced its North America chairman Frank Kern will retire.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 01:51AM ET</span>","Trump panel wants to give USPS right to hike prices for Amazon, others","By Diane Bartz and Jeffrey Dastin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States Postal Service should have more flexibility to raise rates for packages, according to recommendations from a task force set up by President Donald Trump, a move that could hurt profits of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other large online retailers. 
The task force was announced in April to find ways to stem financial losses by the service, an independent agency within the federal government. Its creation followed criticism by Trump that the Postal Office provided too much service to Amazon for too little money.
The Postal Service lost almost $4 billion in fiscal 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, even as package deliveries rose.
It has been losing money for more than a decade, the task force said, partially because the loss of revenue from letters, bills and other ordinary mail in an increasingly digital economy have not been offset by increased revenue from an explosion in deliveries from online shopping.
The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon for treating the Postal Service as its ""delivery boy"" by paying less than it should for deliveries and contributing to the service's $65 billion loss since the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, without presenting evidence.
Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper whose critical coverage of the president has repeatedly drawn Trump's ire.
The rates the Postal Service charges Amazon and other bulk customers are not made public.
""None of our findings or recommendations relate to any one company,"" a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
Amazon shares closed down 5.8 percent at $1,669.94, while eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) fell 3.1 percent to $29.26, amid a broad stock market selloff on Tuesday. 
The Package Coalition, which includes Amazon and other online and catalog shippers, warned against any move to raise prices to deliver their packages.
""The Package Coalition is concerned that, by raising prices and depriving Americans of affordable delivery services, the Postal Task Force’s package delivery recommendations would harm consumers, large and small businesses, and especially rural communities,"" the group said in an emailed statement.
Most of the recommendations made by the task force, including possible price hikes, can be implemented by the agency. Changes, such as to frequency of mail delivery, would require legislation.
The task force recommended that the Postal Service have the authority to charge market-based rates for anything that is not deemed an essential service, like delivery of prescription drugs.
BAD NEWS FOR AMAZON
""Although the USPS does have pricing flexibility within its package delivery segment, packages have not been priced with profitability in mind. The USPS should have the authority to charge market-based prices for both mail and package items that are not deemed 'essential services,'"" the task force said in its summary.
That would be bad news for Amazon and other online sellers that ship billions of packages a year to customers.
""If they go to market pricing, there will definitely be a negative impact on Amazon’s business,"" said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc.
If prices jumped 10 percent, that would increase annual costs for Amazon by at least $1 billion, he said.
The task force also recommended that the Postal Service address rising labor costs.
The Postal Service should also restructure $43 billion in pre-funding payments that it owes the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, the task force said.
Cowen & Co, in a May report, said the Postal Service and Amazon were ""co-dependent,"" but that Amazon went elsewhere for most packages that needed to arrive quickly.
Cowen estimated that the Postal Service delivered about 59 percent of Amazon's U.S. packages in 2017, and package delivery could account for 50 percent of postal service revenue by 2023.
The American Postal Workers Union warned against any effort to cut services. ""Recommendations would slow down service, reduce delivery days and privatize large portions of the public Postal Service. Most of the report’s recommendations, if implemented, would hurt business and individuals alike,"" the union said in a statement. 

Amazon, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) did not return requests for comment.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 01:09AM ET</span>","Malaysian fugitive Jho Low, four others hit with fresh 1MDB charges","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police filed fresh criminal charges and issued arrest warrants for fugitive financier Low Taek Jho and four others wanted in connection with a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, officials said on Wednesday. 
Low, popularly known as Jho Low, has been identified by Malaysian and U.S. investigators as a central figure in the alleged theft of about $4.5 billion from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Low, whose whereabouts is not known, has denied any wrongdoing through a spokesman.
Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged Low and two former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers with conspiracy to launder 1MDB money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
On Tuesday, Low and four others were charged with 13 money laundering and criminal breach of trust offences involving losses of 1MDB funds totaling $1.17 billion or 4.2 billion ringgit, based on foreign exchange rates at the time of the offense, Malaysian police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. 
Arrest warrants were issued against the five who have left Malaysia, Mohamad Fuzi said. 
""If they are found to be in any other country, police and the Attorney General's Chambers will take action to request their extradition so that they can be brought back to Malaysia to face charges in court,"" he said.
1MDB was founded by former Malaysian premier Najib Razak in 2009 and is the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.
Najib was ousted in a general election in May by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who reopened investigations into 1MDB and Najib's involvement at the fund. 
Najib is now facing nearly 40 money laundering and corruption charges related to losses at 1MDB and other government entities. He has consistently denied wrongdoing. 
MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES
Low was charged with five counts of money laundering involving transfers totaling $1.03 billion into a Swiss bank account between Sept 30, 2009 and Oct 25, 2011. 
Along with his aide, Eric Tan Kim Loong, Low faces two more money laundering charges for receiving $126 million in a Singapore-based bank account, Mohamad Fuzi said.
The new charges are in addition to eight counts of money laundering already filed against Low in August.
A spokesman for Low said the latest charges were a continuation of ""trial-by-media"".
""As has been previously stated, Mr. Low will not submit to any jurisdiction where guilt has been predetermined by politics and there is no independent legal process,"" the spokesman said in a statement. 
Also charged were 1MDB's former general counsel Jasmine Loo Ai Swan, its former business development director Casey Tang Keng Chee, and former finance executive director Terence Geh Choh Heng.
Loo and Tan have also been named as key figures in U.S. civil lawsuits seeking to seize more than $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds. 
Unlike Low who has said he is innocent, Tan and the other three others charged have not made any comment about the 1MDB case, and their whereabouts is also unknown.

The lawyers hired by CBS (N:CBS) to investigate the claims against Moonves concluded the company has justification to deny paying his $120 million severance package, the newspaper reported.
The newspaper, citing the draft of a report prepared for the company's board, said lawyers who conducted the inquiry found that Moonves destroyed evidence and misled investigators in a bid to save his reputation and his severance deal.
CBS in September said it would pay $120 million to Moonves if an internal investigation into allegations of harassment failed to provide grounds for his dismissal.
The CBS board retained two law firms, Debevoise & Plimpton and Covington & Burling, to conduct the investigation, in part to determine whether the allegations against Moonves would have constituted grounds for his dismissal, and thus forfeiture of his severance.
According to the Times, which said it reviewed a draft report compiled in November, the investigators wrote that they had substantiated numerous accusations of sexual wrongdoing, some previously undisclosed, against Moonves.
A CBS spokesman, Dana McClintock, said the company had no comment on the Times article.
The Times quoted Moonves' lawyer, Andrew Levander, as saying that his client ""denies having any non-consensual sexual relation"" and ""cooperated extensively and fully with investigators.""
Levander could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.
The lawyers who conducted the inquiry also wrote that they had spoken with Moonves on four occasions and found him to be ""evasive and untruthful at times and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct,"" the Times said.
""Based on the facts developed to date, we believe that the board would have multiple bases upon which to conclude that the company was entitled to terminate Moonves for cause,"" the Times quoted the report as saying.
The 59-page report is expected to be presented to the CBS board ahead of its annual meeting next week, and could be modified before its presentation to the full board, the Times said.
Moonves, who turned CBS from an aging radio and TV broadcaster into a successful provider of shows to digital platforms and was a major figure at the broadcast network and media company for more than two decades, stepped down as chairman, chief executive officer and president of CBS in September amid a wave of accusations that he subjected women to sexual assault and harassment.
Moonves called the allegations ""untrue.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) panel on Tuesday failed to nominate a successor to Carlos Ghosn as chairman in the wake of his arrest and dismissal for alleged financial misconduct last month, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.
Ghosn could remain in detention until the end of the year as Tokyo prosecutors plan to rearrest him on a fresh claim of understating his income, the Sankei newspaper has reported.
Nissan has tasked a three-member panel of external directors with the selection of a new chairman. The panel includes Masakazu Toyoda - a former trade and industry official, Jean-Baptiste Duzan - a retired executive from Nissan's French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), and race car driver Keiko Ihara.
The panel plans to submit the name of a nominee at a board meeting on Dec. 17. Board changes must be approved by shareholders.
The panel did not discuss any particular executive as a nominee at its meeting on Tuesday, the source said, adding the selection was put off because Duzan asked for more time.
Two other people with knowledge of the matter said Renault's board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss the leadership crisis.
Ghosn continues to chair Renault's board, but was ousted from the position at Nissan and third alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) after his arrest on Nov. 19.
Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over the Japanese automaker, which dwarfs Renault in vehicle sales. 
Renault holds 43 percent of Nissan, while Nissan's 15 percent stake in its partner carries no voting rights.
DETENTION
Ghosn, the main architect of the alliance, has been detained in Tokyo since his arrest for allegedly conspiring with former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly to understate his income by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million), over five years from 2010. 
Tokyo authorities on Friday extended Ghosn and Kelly's detention until the maximum Dec. 10.
Citing unnamed sources, the Sankei daily said prosecutors plan to arrest Ghosn and Kelly on Dec. 10 for the same crime covering the period from 2015 to 2017, during which they allegedly understated Ghosn's income by about 4 billion yen. 
If authorities approve the maximum detention for that case, Ghosn and Kelly would remain in custody until Dec. 30, it said.
The Tokyo prosecutors' office declined to comment.
Ghosn has been unable to respond to the allegations, which public broadcaster NHK has said he has denied. Calls to Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, at his office went unanswered.
In Japan, crime suspects can be kept in custody for 10 days and that can be extended for another 10 days if a judge grants prosecutors' request for extension. At the end of that period, prosecutors must file a formal charge or let the suspect go.
However, they can also arrest suspects for a separate crime, in which case the process starts over again. This process can be repeated, sometimes keeping suspects detained for months without formal charges and without bail.

An increase in stake would echo a similar move by BMW (DE:BMWG), which agreed in October to pay 3.6 billion euros ($4.08 billion) to take control of its main joint venture in China with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd (HK:1114).
Brilliance China's shares had slumped nearly 30 percent on that news, with analysts saying the deal would substantially decrease Brilliance's long-term value even as Beijing starts to relax foreign ownership rules for the world's biggest auto market.
Owning majority stakes is likely to spur foreign firms to shift more production to China, helping them protect profits amid uncertainty over a trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Daimler has shown an interest in raising its holding in the joint venture to at least 65 percent from 49 percent, Bloomberg said on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
A 16 percent stake in the venture is likely to be valued at between 2.3 billion euros and 3 billion euros, the report said, citing Christian Ludwig, an analyst with Bankhaus Lampe.
Daimler told Reuters that it does not comment on speculation, adding that it was satisfied with its successful set-up in China and its partnerships.
BAIC denied the report. 
Its shares fell 13.5 percent to a low of HK$4.28 but recouped some losses to trade down 10 percent in morning trade. The stock has more than halved so far this year.

December contracts on the S&P 500 Index rose as much as 0.5 percent as of 12:03 p.m. in Tokyo. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a maximum of 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.
Futures regained their footing in the wake of the underlying market’s biggest rout in almost two months on Tuesday. All three major indexes in the U.S. closed down more than 3 percent, as a lack of meaningful progress on trade relations between the U.S. and China damped investor sentiment while an inverted yield curve sparked concerns of a recession.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) added two executives to its management team to fill the role left by former global wealth management chief Terry Laughlin, who passed away unexpectedly in October, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and Katy Knox, president of Bank of America's private bank, U.S. Trust, will be elevated to the management team and report directly to Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. 
The two new leaders bring different perspectives to the management team. Knox joined the wealth management business as president last year and has experience working with clients from a broad range of business segments, while Sieg, who got his start as a financial analyst at Merrill in 1992, will become the first Merrill Lynch veteran raised to the top ranks of leadership since the company was acquired in 2009. 
Wealth management has been a bright spot for Bank of America in recent quarters. On a call with analysts in October, Moynihan called it ""the best business there is the world.""
In the first nine months of the year profit in the segment surged 28 percent as client balances grew to a record of nearly $2.8 trillion. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management accounted for roughly 84 percent of those assets. 
During his tenure as head of the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, Sieg has focused on increasing referrals from wealth management services to other products at the bank like loans and credit cards.
Sources who have worked with him say he would do well in the role given his ability to please Merrill’s ""thundering herd"" of thousands of financial advisors, and the firm’s corporate banking parent. 

Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag also worked at Merrill Lynch, but only for a brief few months before the company was acquired by Bank of America in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank also announced that Dean Athanasia would take sole leadership of the consumer lines of business after sharing the role with Thong Nguyen who has been appointed vice chairman. Additionally, Vice Chair Anne Finucane will begin to focus on her role as chair of Bank of America’s EU bank.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Detroit on Tuesday sold its first standalone bonds since exiting bankruptcy four years ago to U.S. municipal market investors, who snapped up the debt albeit at hefty yields.
The unlimited-tax general obligation bond issue sold solely under the city's junk-rated credit was increased to $135 million from nearly $111 million due to strong investor demand and ""attractive borrowing costs,"" according to John Hill, Detroit's chief financial officer. 
He attributed the deal's success to a combination of market conditions and the city's message of how far it has come since it ended what was then the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in December 2014.
""This shows we're back in the market now on our own credit. It's quite a milestone,"" Hill said.
The deal also sends a message to other financially distressed issuers that a bond default or bankruptcy may not lock them out of the $3.8 trillion muni market for that long, according to Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.
""My goodness, this is a pretty quick turnaround from bankruptcy to selling debt in a very short amount of time,"" he said.
Detroit's bonds were sold amid a muni market price rally that lowered yields on Municipal Market Data's (MMD) benchmark scale as much as 8 basis points, while U.S. Treasury yields also fell and U.S. stock indexes suffered steep drops.
Yields topped out at 4.95 percent for bonds due in 2038 with a 5 percent coupon. Spreads over MMD's triple-A yield scale ranged from 183 basis points in 2023 to 200 basis points in 2033 and 190 basis points in 2038.
Daniel Berger, MMD's senior market strategist, said investors ""were willing to give (Detroit) a fresh start, but at a high-yield price."" He said spreads in the city's deal were comparable to those in last week's junk-rated Chicago Board of Education GO bond sale.
Venditti said the bonds' pricing had less to do with Detroit's post-bankruptcy story and more with market dynamics.""Yield is still very, very difficult to find and hey here's some yield,"" he said. 
The bonds were rated three to four notches below investment grade at Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service and B-plus by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. Detroit tapped voter-approved authority that dates back to 2004 and 2009 for the bonds, which will fund capital projects.
Ahead of the sale, Detroit officials touted improvements in the city's financial management, budget, and services as well as increased economic development. The bankruptcy, which was eclipsed by Puerto Rico's 2017 filing, allowed the city to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations. 
Michigan's largest city was able to terminate active post-bankruptcy oversight of its finances in April after concluding three straight fiscal years with balanced budgets.

The plunge in U.S. stocks came after top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow backtracked from U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that Beijing had agreed to reduce tariffs on U.S.-made cars.
“It hasn’t been signed and sealed and delivered yet,” Kudlow said on Fox News Tuesday.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component fell 0.6% and 0.5% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 1.6% lower.
Following Saturday’s dinner, the U.S. and China agreed to halt the planned increase in tariffs to 25% from 10% on Chinese imports. However, the remaining details of what was agreed at the dinner were unclear.
China’s Ministry of Commerce released its first official statement on the meeting on Wednesday and said the trade meeting with the U.S. was “very successful”, but did not provide any further details on the outcome of the meeting.
An earlier report by the Washington Post claimed that China was 'puzzled and irritated' by Trump administration's announcement following the meeting.
""You don't do this with the Chinese. You don't triumphantly proclaim all their concessions in public. It's just madness,"" the Post reported citing people familiar with the matter.
There are ""significant differences"" between the two countries’ versions of what was agreed upon at the dinner, according to the Post.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% after data showed the Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 52.3 on a seasonally adjusted basis in November, compared to October's six-month high of 52.4.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.4%, while Australia’s ASX 200 was down 1.4%.
In other news, suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone underperformed after chipmaker Cirrus Logic Inc (NASDAQ:CRUS) cut its December-quarter revenue outlook due to “recent weaknesses in the smartphone market.” TSMC (TW:2330) fell 3.4%,  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938) and  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) dropped almost 2%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) chief executive said on Tuesday after a meeting at the White House that the German automaker was building an alliance with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and might use the U.S. automaker's plants to build cars.
VW CEO Herbert Diess said the company was also ""considering building a second car plant"" in the United States, adding, ""We are in quite advanced negotiations and dialog with Ford Corporation to really build up a global automotive alliance, which also would strengthen the American automotive industry.""
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told reporters at an event near Detroit on Tuesday that talks with Volkswagen about an alliance are going “very well.""
Asked about Diess’ comments that VW could use some of Ford’s unused capacity for car production, Bill Ford said the companies ""haven’t gotten that granular in our talks yet.""
He said he did not want to say much about a VW alliance until the automaker had ""a lot of definitive things to talk about.""
The proposed alliance between Volkswagen and Ford suggests the days of carmakers going it alone are over, as tariffs, new technology and tougher emissions rules fragment markets that were once global, Reuters reported last week.
Firms that once sought vehicles with universal global appeal to create economies of scale are now seeking advantages in specific market segments like hybrid SUVs, North American pickup trucks or European city cars.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said in a research note on Tuesday that said Diess' comments raised the chances that VW would use some of Ford's unused capacity as part of a broader partnership. Spak also said that a European or Asian automaker could seek to acquire some of General Motors Co's (N:GM) unused capacity. GM announced last week it plans to idle five North American plants.
""VW may have a little negotiating power as some of the GM facilities could be bought (although this could impact their broader intentions with Ford),"" Spak wrote.
VW has an assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Of the need for a new plant, Diess said the company is in ""quite advanced negotiations in Tennessee but there might be other options as well.""
Diess said VW would not take an equity stake in Ford as part of its alliance. ""We are building an alliance with Ford which will strengthen Ford's position in Europe because we will share platforms,"" he said. ""We might use Ford capacity here in the U.S. to build cars for us.""

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK steel sector crippled by power costs as Brexit looms,"By Maytaal Angel
LONDON (Reuters) - British steelmakers pay twice as much for electricity as their French competitors and 50 percent more than their German rivals, an industry report showed on Wednesday, piling pressure on the sector as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. 
The report, commissioned by industry group UK Steel, shows the disparity between UK electricity prices and those in EU countries has increased for a third consecutive year, crippling energy-intensive sectors such as steel.
It comes ahead of Britain's looming EU exit on March 29, which could hit UK manufacturing hard if it results in widespread customs delays, new tariffs and other trade barriers with Britain's largest trading partner. 
""The price disparity continues to erode the industry’s ability to attract international investment – investments will instead be made in markets with more favorable conditions,"" said Gareth Stace, UK Steel's director general.
""It is high time the government ensured the future viability of the UK steel sector.""
The industry report shows the government's review on industrial strategy and energy costs, launched a year ago, has yet to protect vulnerable industries from the effects of Britain's looming EU exit.
Steel, the second most used material in the world behind cement, often makes its way up Britain's political agenda because it is seen as a strategic industry critical for growth. The metal is also used to make military weapons. 
The UK steel industry is slowly emerging from a crisis that resulted in the loss of 7,000 steel jobs, about a quarter of the workforce, between September 2015 and March 2017. It is estimated that for every steel job axed, four jobs are lost in related sectors.
Tata Steel UK, Britain's largest steelmaker, is still seen by some analysts as vulnerable to cutbacks because of poor earnings as its Indian parent prepares to finalize its merger with German steelmaker Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) next year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) plans to quadruple the number of mainland Chinese companies covered by research from its China joint venture over the next two years as it seeks to take advantage of its headstart as the first international bank to have majority control of its mainland securities firm. 
Shenzhen-based HSBC Qianhai Securities, run in conjunction with a local government investment vehicle holding 49 percent, began operating a year ago offering equity and debt underwriting, research and broking as well as M&A advice and investment advisory work.
In addition to the 280 Chinese companies covered already by the bank, HSBC Qianhai has added more than 80 mainland-listed stocks since it opened, and plans to have expanded that to 400, according to Irene Ho, chief executive of HSBC Qianhai, in an interview with Reuters.
""We expect to get to 400 in two years – there or there abouts,"" Ho said. HSBC is working to take advantage of what executives believe is a three-year headstart on international rivals because of its majority control, which it gained by virtue of rules favoring Hong Kong businesses.
Last Friday UBS (S:UBSG) became only the second bank to gain approval for 51 percent control under a broader relaxation of financial-sector ownership by Beijing.
The opening up of China’s financial sector promises huge opportunities for international players, until now mostly operating on the margins of mainland markets.
Analysts at UBS have forecast that foreign banks could quadruple their revenues from brokerage in China by 2025 if the trend of market opening continues. Last year, foreigners took 1.3 percent of the total fee pool, according to the UBS report, published in June. 
Banks have been beefing up their research teams in recent years and market leaders such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Citigroup  (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), UBS, and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), produce research on between 150 and 400 listed Chinese companies each. 
Helping foreign banks this year has been the acceptance of mainland Chinese stocks and bonds into global benchmark indices, forcing index-tracking investors to invest onshore for the first time.
While index inclusion is only gradual and investor appetite this year has been dented by market falls – China’s blue-chip CSI Index (CSI) has fallen about 19 percent since Jan. 1 - executives are still confident in the longer-term opportunity.
""The key point here is they (investors) are all getting set up to trade China, and in a way it's not a bad thing for us that it's a difficult market because that gives them time to get set up, while we are developing our platform as well,"" Gordon French, HSBC's Asia-Pacific head of global banking and markets, told Reuters.
PIVOT TO ASIA
More than 180 people now work for HSBC Qianhai – it also has branches in Beijing and Shanghai – and the bank considers it a key part of its “pivot to Asia” strategy, announced in 2015. 
Asia accounted for more than three quarters of HSBC’s adjusted pre-tax profits last year. 
Bankers travel regularly between the bank’s regional Hong Kong headquarters and its Qianhai offices, with French making 10 trips so far this year to attend senior staff meetings.
HSBC is now preparing to apply for additional licenses for its Qianhai business that would allow it to offer structured financing, asset backed securities and other wealth management products, and also fixed-income trading – part of a push, French said, to bring HSBC’s full range of services to China. 

""The reason we are doing this is because we want to build a platform of product and services which looks extremely similar to what we currently have in Hong Kong and London, meaning full service, universal banking,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed senior executives of leading German automakers to expand their investments in the United States as the White House considers imposing new tariffs on European-made vehicles.
German automakers said after the meeting they told Trump they planned to boost U.S. investments, but warned they would be unable to do so if the administration imposed new tariffs.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) executives both said they thought the chances that new tariffs will be imposed had been lessened following the meeting.
Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said the company was ""considering building a second car plant"" and was in talks with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) about a broader alliance. He said it could include VW using unused Ford capacity to build cars.
""The president has a point,"" Diess said, saying officials ""tried to convince us to invest more into America and we are prepared to do this.""
Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters that additional U.S. investments are contingent on conditions remaining the same. Zetsche said the ""implicit potential threat"" of new tariffs had been reduced after the meeting.
BMW AG (DE:BMWG) said in a statement that it plans to invest $600 million more at its Spartanburg plant in South Carolina through 2021 for future generations of the BMW X models and will create 1,000 more jobs by 2021.
Diess said he thought the companies had ""made a big step forward to avoid the tariffs.""
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow were among those who met with the executives. 
Trump has threatened to impose stiff tariffs on cars assembled in the European Union as part of his ""America First"" trade policy.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business News Tuesday that he thinks ""we have a really good path to coming up with having these companies invest more in America."" He added that the German automakers ""wouldn’t be coming to the table here to talk to us unless the president had auto tariffs on the table.""
Although the European Commission handles trade negotiations on behalf of the common trading bloc, the Trump administration has summoned the auto bosses as part of a campaign to ""rebalance"" global trade flows.
Last week, BMW said it was considering building a second manufacturing plant in the United States that could produce engines and transmissions, drawing praise from Trump, who has made the revitalization of U.S. manufacturing a key pillar of his economic program. On Tuesday, BMW emphasized that it had not yet made a final decision.
Zetsche said it is ""impossible"" to build all vehicles sold in the United States because of small volumes of small luxury cars.
The Commerce Department has circulated draft recommendations to the White House on its investigation into whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds, Reuters reported in November. 
Kudlow said he did not think that car tariffs were imminent, though he added that they were in Trump's ""quiver of arrows.""

A U.S. government official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Monday that no final report on the investigation is expected for at least a couple of weeks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.1%. The S&P 500 fell 3.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.8%.
Trump unleashed a tweetstorm Tuesday, saying he would ""happily sign"" a fair trade deal with China, but referred to himself as a ""Tariff Man,"" sending a stark reminder that U.S.-China trade relations remain vulnerable.
Trade-sensitive stocks like industrials wiped gains from a day earlier as investors questioned whether Trump's trade advisors, led by Robert Lighthizer, could achieve anything in the 90-day ceasefire agreed by Trump and China President Xi Jinping over the weekend.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), barometers of trade given their large international exposure, ended the day sharply lower.
Financials and tech, meanwhile, led the rout on Wall Street.
Short-dated Treasury rates rose above longer-dated rates, referred to as an inversion of the Treasury yield curve, a signal of a potential economic recession.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) fell 3.8% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) lost 4.4%.
Inverted yields are seen as headwind for banks, weighing on their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
The curve between three-year and five-year Treasury notes and between two-year and five-year notes inverted on Monday, the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt.
Analysts expect the two-year, 10-year yield curve -- seen as a possible precursor to a recession -- to follow suit. The spread has already narrowed to its lowest in over a decade.
""While interest rate hikes have sent short-dated yields higher, tepid inflation and slowing economic growth expectations have kept longer-dated yields pinned down,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""Right now it's a bearish sentiment. As soon as investors digested the information from the discussions, they focused on the uncertainties and lack of details,"" Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada said.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped 4.4% as supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) trimmed its revenue outlook. That added to a slew of profit warnings from several Apple suppliers in recent weeks, pointing to signs of weakness in the smartphone market, which also weighed on chip stocks.
Among other FANG stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 4.8%, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lost 2.2% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slumped 5.2%.
In corporate news, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS) plunged after Morgan Stanley raised concerns that Amazon Air could eat into the revenues of both delivery service companies.

1208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","As Bank Shares Burn, Here's What CEOs Are Telling Investors","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks took one of their worst beatings in years as investor concerns over global trade and interest rates reignited Tuesday.
The stock decline came just as chief executive officers gathered at one of the industry’s biggest annual conferences, passing a microphone to update shareholders on business. Inside the Manhattan venue booked by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., there was little mention of the panic unfolding in markets -- until Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman quipped that the scene is a “barf burger.”
The KBW Bank Index fell 4.9 percent, its worst performance since February.
Yes, some bank CEOs said, there are reasons to doubt the U.S. and China are on the brink of an agreement to avert a trade war. But they also laid out bright spots at home, emphasizing that the economy is strong while trying to make a case that it’s better to buy or hold -- not sell -- their stocks. Here’s the rundown:
China Talks
“There’s no way” the Trump administration and China will hash out a complex trade agreement in just 90 days, according to Jamie Dimon, who as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s CEO runs the largest U.S. bank. His comments came after Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, dialed back the president’s earlier tweet on a deal to reduce tariffs on U.S.-made cars. Dimon said he’s hoping authorities will announce progress in weeks ahead.
Meantime, don’t obsess about “the market ebb and flow on a given day based on the progress or perceived progress of talks,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s Brian Moynihan told investors.
Interest Rates
A flattening or inverted yield curve can erode revenue from loans by making it harder for banks to profit by using short-term borrowing to finance long-term lending. But Moynihan said the debate is still open over whether the current trend is signaling an economic downturn.
“We believe it’s because the economy is strong,” he told CNBC in an interview. The Fed is removing monetary accommodation, which puts pressure on the long end of the curve, he said. But banks such as his can lean on their vast deposits to profitably finance loans and continue to boost revenue, he said.
Still,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s Tim Sloan delivered some bad news on that front: His bank expects to collect $12.6 billion in interest in the fourth quarter, below the $12.8 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Retail deposit pricing remains stable, he said, but there’s strong competition for deposits from companies and wealthy customers.
Consumer Health
Sloan and Dimon both flagged the general indebtedness of consumers. Sloan said that trend may help earnings, as banks see more people hold balances on their credit cards, which generates interest as long as customers keep up with their obligations. “We’re not really seeing any sort of cracks from consumer delinquency or consumer loss standpoint in any of the product types,” he said.
Dimon, meanwhile, expressed concern about people carrying massive student loans. But consumer and business confidence are still close to all-time highs, he said, “so it looks like we’re doing fine.”
Tech Spending
Dimon said he expects JPMorgan’s technology budget will keep increasing, though “hopefully less than revenues.” The bank earmarked about $10.8 billion for tech in 2018, with about half of it going to new tech, platforms or data, with the rest maintaining existing systems.
Wells Fargo will spend about $9 billion on technology this year, including $800 million on its efforts to improve cybersecurity, Sloan said. Moynihan expects Bank of America’s spending on new technology will flatten.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Volkswagen says last generation of combustion engines to be launched in 2026,"WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) strategy chief said on Tuesday the German carmaker's core brand will develop its final generation of vehicles using combustion engine technology in 2026. 
Volkswagen made a strategy shift toward battery-driven vehicles in the wake of a damaging diesel-emissions cheating scandal in 2015, which forced the carmaker to pay more than 27 billion euros in fines for hiding excessive pollution.
""In the year 2026 will be the last product start on a combustion engine platform,"" Michael Jost told the Handelsblatt automotive summit conference at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.
A spokesman confirmed Jost's remarks meant that VW, Europe and China's best selling passenger car brand, will focus on electric cars instead.
VW will continue to adapt its petrol and diesel engined cars to meet environmental standards during the lifetime of those vehicles, but the German carmaker is now committed to radical steps to stop global warming, Jost said. 

As a way to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord, Volkswagen has changed its car development benchmarks to include the target of radically cutting levels of carbon dioxide pollution in production as well, Jost said.

1216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>","Chastened But Not Beaten, Emerging-Market Bonds Eye 2019 Reboot","(Bloomberg) -- As the worst year for emerging markets since the financial crisis nears its end, bonds are looking ripe for a rebound in 2019.
With Federal Reserve policy tightening and the U.S.- China trade dispute battering developing-nation bonds, the year might have been expected to end with much more distressed debt, negative real yields and weakened government finances.
Far from it.
Besides China, where the property sector is under strain for domestic reasons, most emerging economies have seen distressed debt levels remain unchanged this year. Central banks have ensured currencies maintain yield spreads no matter what the Fed decides. Moreover, fiscal balances -- already looking healthy -- are projected to improve.
Dwindling Distress
Most emerging markets have few or no corporate bonds whose option-adjusted spreads over U.S. Treasuries are above 1,000 basis points, a typical definition of distress.
Bottom line: concerns that emerging markets are headed for defaults and restructurings are probably overblown.
Real Yields
As central banks respond to the end of easy money and raise interest rates, yield differentials over Treasuries are luring back investors. But the higher returns don’t necessarily have to come with higher risk. The gap between policy rates and inflation rates is widening, and holding up even when corrected for volatility.
Fiscal Test
The challenge now is for governments to keep their economies growing at a time when borrowing costs are rising. Yet economists project governments will remain mindful of spending to avert fiscal shocks."

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had complained last week in a hearing that the two sides had treated him as a ""rubber stamp"" for the agreement. CVS closed the $69 billion transaction last week and began the integration process.
""At this stage, I am less convinced of the sufficiency of the government's negotiated remedy than the government is,"" he wrote in the order issued on Tuesday.
The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna on condition that the health insurer sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (N:WCG). That sale was completed last month.
Also in the order, Leon asked the government and the companies to file a brief by Dec. 14 to show why their integration should not be halted while he considers whether or not to approve the consent decree reached in October.
Most consent agreements that the antitrust agencies strike with companies to resolve competitive concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreements are in the public interest.

Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.

In presentation to investors in New York, Vale executives projected the company would produce 244,000 tonnes of nickel next year, below the 263,000 tonnes it had forecast a year ago. 
The company said on Tuesday that it could produce 313,000 tonnes of nickel annually in the short term and 400,000 tonnes annually in the medium term. During the presentation each year, the company usually gives annual projections five years out. 
Nickel, a key input for most types of lithium-ion batteries, is expected to benefit from a widely expected pickup in electric vehicle (EV) sales. 
The metal , also used to make stainless steel, hit multi-month lows last week as demand worries escalated on Chinese steel price weakness and U.S.-Sino trade tensions. 
Vale said on Tuesday it had reached a deal with global trader and miner  Glencore  (L:GLEN) to jointly explore Vale's Victor mine for copper and nickel and Glencore's Nickel Rim South mines in Canada, citing reduced costs and capital expenses thanks to the venture.
Vale, also the world's top iron ore producer, maintained its outlook for iron ore production at 390 million tonnes for this year and 400 million tonnes for 2019 and 2020.
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman, whose two-year term is up in May, reiterated his interest in staying on and said discussions were ongoing about his future role.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Germany's largest union demands 6 percent pay rise for steel workers,"By Tom and Kaeckenhoff
DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - German trade union IG Metall on Tuesday demanded a 6 percent wage increase for the 72,000 employees in the steel industry in the northwest of the country, firing the opening shot in next year's wage negotiations.
IG Metall's influential branch in western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is also demanding an annual bonus of 1,800 euros, which workers could opt to convert into additional days off.
The demand by IG Metall, Germany's largest labor union representing 3.9 million workers in the metal working and electrical sectors, could possibly set a benchmark for wage negotiations in the car and manufacturing industries.
Last year, the group demanded a similar increase and the right to shorter hours.
After hard-fought negotiations and strikes in Germany's industrial heartland in the southwest, it reached a deal with employers that foresees a 4.3 percent pay rise and other payments spread over 27 months.
That deal was seen as marking the end of years of wage restraint in Germany, helping the European Central Bank as it tries to keep inflation close to its target and keeping it on track to curb its massive stimulus.
This year's negotiations will happen against the backdrop of a cooling trend in Europe's economic powerhouse, which is in its ninth straight year of growth.
U.S. TARIFFS
A generous wage deal would boost consumption and provide much-needed impulses to offset headwinds from weakening exports.
""The upward trend in the metal industry is persistent,"" said Knut Giesler, head of IG Metall's branch in NRW. ""Capacity utilization this year stood at 90 percent, approaching the average rate in the years before the (2008) crisis.""
The first round of negotiations is set for Jan. 10.
The industry is feeling the heat of tariffs imposed earlier this year by U.S. President Donald Trump on steel and aluminum imported from the European Union. The European Commission and the U.S. government are trying to resolve a tariffs dispute.
Trump has also threatened to imposed tariffs on cars imported from the bloc.
Giesler said despite trade frictions, steel prices have risen by 80 percent over the last three years.

The $7.5 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF, ticker TLT, rose as much as 2.8 percent Tuesday and has gained 3.2 percent since Thursday, its best four-day gain since May, pushing the fund over its 200-day moving average. TLT tracks a market-weighted index of U.S. Treasuries that mature in 20 years or more.
“With the yield curve flattening driven by weakness in the long end, TLT has staged a comeback, rallying off a double bottom and moving above its 200-day moving average,” said Josh Lukeman, head of ETF market making for the Americas at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. “This setup could portend higher prices yet to come.”
Traders have been slashing the expected pace of rate hikes since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s seemingly dovish comments on Wednesday. The shift in the market’s view has picked up speed this week, with a section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve having just inverted for the first time in more than a decade.
The spread between 3- and 5-year yields slid below zero for the first time since 2007 on Tuesday, followed by the gap between the 2- to 5-year notes. The difference between 2- and 10-year bond yields is more closely watched as a potential indicator of pending recessions, and TD Securities rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg expects it to flatten to zero.
“There has been very strong demand for long-end Treasuries, which has been led by futures buying,” Goldberg said. “Given that the long-end is rallying in conjunction with a decline in equities, we may be seeing a reallocation out of stocks into long-dated fixed income on expectations that the hiking cycle is getting closer to the finish line.”"

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL) and other tech giants face one of their biggest challenges this week as a key EU lawmaking committee prepares to take a tough stance on legislation designed to curb their power and boost the rights of businesses.
In a bid to ensure a level playing field between the tech companies and bricks-and-mortar businesses, the European Commission in April drafted rules to prevent unfair business practices by app stores, search engines, e-commerce sites and hotel booking websites.
These include forcing search engines such as Google to provide information on how they rank products and services in internet search results. Europe's telecoms industry has also seized the opportunity to lobby for tougher rules for internet rivals.
The proposal, known as the platform-to-business regulation (P2B), needs to be approved by EU countries and the European Parliament before it can become law. Lawmakers, under pressure to be seen as consumer-friendly ahead of May elections, have come up with numerous amendments to beef up the draft.
Key among these are one proposed by Danish center-left lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, the lead parliament negotiator, which takes aim at online marketplaces such as Amazon which critics say use their merchants' data to make copycat products.
Schaldemose wants these companies to set up Chinese walls between subsidiaries and to get merchants' consent before their data can be used. Her compatriot, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, is also looking into the issue.
Lawmakers have also come up with a list of unfair trading practices which they want to ban, and also proposed more powers for national authorities to go after rule breakers.
Tech lobbying group CCIA, whose members include Amazon, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), said lawmakers should not be too hasty in clamping down on the sector.
""Intrusive rules in a one-size-fits-all regulation make little sense for a sector as diverse as online services. That is why both Commission and Member States support a measured approach based on transparency,"" CCIA vice president Jakob Kucharczyk said.

EU governments adopted a joint position last week, sticking closely to the Commission's proposal. The parliamentary committee will vote on the amendments on Thursday, after which the EU body will thrash out a common position with EU governments and the Commission.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.25%, while the S&P 500 sank 2.4%.
The NASDAQ Composite fell 2.7% after techs joined the early selloff around midday, pushing the entire market even lower.
Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday that a deal between the two countries would get done if possible. But the president referred to himself as a ""Tariff Man,"" hinting that he was prepared to re-escalate tensions with China.
Financials, meanwhile, led the rout on Wall Street as a continued inversion on parts of the Treasury yield curve weighed on banks.
Inverted yields are seen as headwind for banks, weighing on their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) fell 3% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) plunged 5%.
The curve between three-year and five-year Treasury notes and between two-year and five-year notes inverted on Monday, the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt.
Analysts expect the two-year, 10-year yield curve -- seen as a possible precursor to a recession -- to follow suit. The spread has already narrowed to its lowest in over a decade.
""While interest rate hikes have sent short-dated yields higher, tepid inflation and slowing economic growth expectations have kept longer-dated yields pinned down,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""It's a signal we're getting closer to (full) inversion but we're still a fair distance from it. It's something to note ... something to be aware of but there're other facts in play.""
""Right now it's a bearish sentiment. As soon as investors digested the information from the discussions, they focused on the uncertainties and lack of details,"" Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada said.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 12:58PM ET</span>",JPMorgan CEO Dimon: Buybacks are for times when stock is cheap,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) on Tuesday said he favors using the bank's excess capital to reinvest in its business instead of buying back stock. 
""Stock buyback, in my opinion, is a very good thing to do when your stock is cheap,"" he said at an investor conference hosted by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Dimon also said fourth-quarter trading revenue so far is ""roughly equivalent"" to last year.
The comments on buybacks come after JPMorgan shares have traded for a year at more than $100 and roughly two times tangible book value.
""The highest and best use of our capital is reinvesting it and we are starting to do that now,"" Dimon said, citing additional spending on technology, branches and loans to small business as examples.
""This notion that you should buy back stock at three times tangible book value as a return of capital to shareholders is crazy,"" he said.
He said he favors paying out dividends amounting to about 30 percent to 35 percent of annual earnings.
Protesters interrupted Dimon's comments twice to challenge JPMorgan over the financing of private prisons and immigration detention centers.
After the protesters were silenced, Dimon told the audience, ""You should know that they do have legitimate issues.""

He added, ""Those prisons they are talking about are sanctioned by government agencies, audited by government agencies.""

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Las Vegas gambler Walters loses insider trading appeal,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the insider trading conviction and five-year prison sentence of famed Las Vegas sports gambler William ""Billy"" Walters, even as it chastised an FBI agent for leaking grand jury information about the case.
Walters, 72, had been accused of using nonpublic information from former  Dean Foods Co  (N:DF) Chairman Thomas Davis about the dairy processing company and from Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (N:DRI) to make more than $43 million in profits and avoided losses from 2008 to 2014.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Walters' April 2017 conviction was not unconstitutionally tainted by several leaks from Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent David Chaves to reporters about the grand jury probe.
It also rejected Walters' claims that prosecutors suborned perjury by Davis over the use of a disposable cellphone nicknamed the ""Batphone"" to provide tips, and that the evidence didn't support his conviction related to Darden.
""Walters received a full and fair trial in which there was overwhelming evidence to support his conviction,"" Circuit Judge Denny Chin wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel.
While ""Chaves' misconduct is deeply troubling,"" it did not qualify as ""outrageous government misconduct"" that could justify dismissing the case, Chin added.
The court also upheld Walters' $10 million fine and $25.35 million forfeiture. It ordered the trial judge, Kevin Castel, to recalculate Walters' $8.88 million in restitution to Dean Foods in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision.
Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs, in a concurring opinion, called Chaves' leaks ""in some respects more egregious"" than Walters' crimes.
""The FBI depends on the confidence of the public, jurors and judges,"" Jacobs wrote. ""That confidence is critical to its mission; so this kind of thing is very bad for business.""
Alexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Walters, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.
Walters had built an estimated $200 million fortune as one of the most successful U.S. sports betters.
He had maintained his innocence, and told reporters after his conviction: ""I just did lose the biggest bet of my life.""
The case drew added attention because of Walters' relationships with billionaire investor Carl Icahn and champion golfer Phil Mickelson, neither of whom was criminally charged.
Mickelson, who once had gambling debts to Walters, agreed in May 2016 to forfeit $1.03 million he made on Dean Foods shares to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case.

The case is U.S. v. Walters, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-2373.

(Reuters) - Banks led Wall Street lower on Tuesday, as a decline in U.S. bond yields set off warning lights about slowing growth, while industrial and technology stocks fell on skepticism over the chances of a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade talks.
Following a rally on Monday after Washington and Beijing agreed to a three-month truce to iron out their trade differences, the three major indexes pulled back about 0.8 percent as some U.S. Treasury yields inverted.
The curve between three-year and five-year Treasury notes and between two-year and five-year notes inverted on Monday — the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt. [US/]
Analysts expect the two-year, 10-year yield curve — seen as a possible precursor to a recession — to follow suit. The spread has already narrowed to its lowest in over a decade.
""While interest rate hikes have sent short-dated yields higher, tepid inflation and slowing economic growth expectations have kept longer-dated yields pinned down,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""It's a signal we're getting closer to (full) inversion but we're still a fair distance from it. It's something to note ... something to be aware of but there're other facts in play.""
The KBW Bank index (BKX) slid 2.83 percent, with Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) dropping about 3 percent each. The overall S&P financial sector (SPSY) dropped 2.13 percent.
The S&P technology sector (SPLRCT) fell 1.13 percent, while industrials (SPLRCI) dropped 1.98 percent. Both sectors tend to react the most to trade news and led the market's gains on Monday after the Sino-U.S. trade truce.
However, confusion over when the 90-day period starts and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a China trade hawk, leading the talks fanned doubts if an actual resolution could be reached.
""Right now it's a bearish sentiment. As soon as investors digested the information from the discussions, they focused on the uncertainties and lack of details,"" Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada said.
Trade bellwethers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) weighed the most on the Dow, while Apple Inc (O:AAPL), one of Monday's leaders, pressured the S&P and the Nasdaq.
Apple dropped 2.1 percent as supplier Cirrus Logic Inc (O:CRUS) trimmed its revenue outlook, adding to growing evidence of tepid iPhones sales.
At 11:30 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 206.86 points, or 0.80 percent, at 25,619.57, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 0.81 percent, at 2,767.66 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 0.98 percent, at 7,368.41.
Luxury home builder  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) dropped 2 percent and weighed on its peers after reporting its first fall in orders in over four years due to higher interest rates and home prices.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.26-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters to cut 3,200 jobs in next two years","By Matt Scuffham
TORONTO (Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI) said on Tuesday that it will cut its workforce by 12 percent in the next two years, axing 3,200 jobs, as part of a plan to streamline the business and reduce costs.
The news and information provider, which completed the sale of a 55-percent stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), announced the cuts during an investor day in Toronto, in which it outlined its future strategy and growth plans.
The company, which is focusing on its legal and tax businesses following the Blackstone deal, declined to say where the job cuts were being made. However, Co-Chief Operating Officer Neil Masterson told investors that staff had already been informed about 90 percent of the planned cuts.
Shares in Thomson Reuters rose as much as 3.7 percent on Tuesday, hitting an all-time high. 
""They laid out some good plans for the next couple of years,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman. ""I think there is still a long road ahead, but it was positive. They explained in more detail the pathway to more organic growth."" 
The company aims to grow annual sales by 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent by 2020, excluding the impact of any acquisitions. Chief Executive Officer Jim Smith said it plans to cross-sell more products to existing customers and to attract new customers. The company will also cut the number of products it sells, he said.
""We're going to simplify the company in every way that we can, working on sales effectiveness and on ways to make it easier both for our customers to do business with us and for our frontline troops to navigate inside the organization,"" he said.
As part of the streamlining, the company said it planned to reduce the number of offices around the world by 30 percent to 133 locations by 2020. 
Following the Blackstone deal, about 43 percent of Thomson Reuters revenues come from its legal business, with 23 percent of sales coming from corporate clients and 15 percent of sales coming from its tax business. 
Reuters News accounts for only 6 percent of sales but Smith said it remained a key part of the business under Michael Friedenberg, who joined the company on Monday as president of its news and media operations.
""We believe he can make Reuters News an even greater part of our growth story going forward,"" Smith said.
Thomson Reuters set a target to reduce its capital expenditure to between 7 percent and 8 percent of revenue in 2020 from 10 percent currently.
The company has set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from the Blackstone deal to make purchases to help grow its legal and tax businesses.

Shares in Thomson Reuters have risen by 40 percent since May, benefiting from the company buying back $10 billion worth of shares.

The S&P 500 Financials index fell about 2.3% at 11:45 AM ET (16:45 GMT).
 State Street  (NYSE:STT) fell about 5.3%, while Fifth Third (NASDAQ:FITB) was off about 4.6%.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) tumbled about 3.8% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) lost about 3.5%.
A yield curve inversion happens when longer yields fall below those of shorter-dated bonds.
The 3-year and 5-year Treasuries inverted Monday for the first time since 2007 and today the 2-year and 3-year yields were above the 5-year yield.
The 2-Year yield was at about 2.821%, with the 3-Year around 2.827% and the 5-Year below them at 2.809%.
Inversions are troublesome for bank earnings as it could lead to negative net interest margins, where banks loan out at lower longer-term rates while paying higher shorter-term rates borrowing (such as for deposits)."

Beiersdorf said Asim Naseer, P&G global marketing director for skin care, would take over as head of consumer brands from Jan. 1, replacing Ralph Gusko, who continues his responsibility for Asia Pacific for now but will leave by the end of 2019.
Ramon Mirt, who headed Reckitt Benckiser's business in central and eastern Europe, will take charge of the Near East and Americas regions for Beiersdorf in March, the firm said.
""We welcome Asim Naseer and Ramon A. Mirt and their rich expertise. They will help Beiersdorf further deepen its commitment to international diversity and being closest to markets and consumers,"" said chairman Reinhard Poellath.
Beiersdorf announced in October that deputy CEO De Loecker, a 51-year-old from Belgium, would take over from Stefan Heidenreich on Jan. 1, with a mandate to make the company more digitally savvy and expand internationally.
Beiersdorf said the management of its consumer business would be overseen by a newly established executive committee, to include global head of research and development May Shana'a, as well as supply chain head Harald Emberger.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 11:13AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Exxon, Chevron seek to exit Azerbaijan's oil after 25 years","By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) are seeking to sell their stakes in Azerbaijan's largest oilfield, marking the retreat of the U.S. majors from the former Soviet state after 25 years as they re-focus on domestic production. 
Exxon is hoping to raise up to $2 billion from the sale of its 6.8 percent in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea, according to industry sources. 
Rival Chevron said in a statement to Reuters it had also decided to launch the sale of its 9.57 percent stake in ACG as well as its 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.
Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment, saying ""we don't comment on market rumors or speculation"". A spokesman for Azerbaijan's state energy company Socar said: ""The report is about Exxon and there is no need for Socar to get involved.""
For both companies, the sale would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan's current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994. 
The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the ""the contract of the century"" thanks to the field's large reserves and hopes of future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.
Even though the project is operated by British oil major  BP  (L:BP), it had received substantial U.S. government support and a total of five American companies initially participated in the deal, including Exxon, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott.
BP said it had no information about Exxon's or Chevron's plans.
The ACG project received particular Western support due to hopes it would help cut Europe's reliance on Russian energy, but those hopes faded as new large discoveries failed to materialize.
Most U.S. companies sold out of the project or were acquired by rivals, while U.S. support to the Azeri administration also shrank. 
Azerbaijan also became more assertive in controlling its energy wealth by building up large stakes in its energy projects via state company Socar.
Other than Exxon and Chevron, BP holds a 30.4 percent stake in ACG and Socar a 25 percent stake.
The ACG fields still account for the lion's share of Azeri oil output. They produced around three quarters of overall Azeri crude output, or nearly 600,000 barrels per day, in the first half of 2018.
Other ACG consortium members include Japan's Inpex with 9.3 percent and Norway's Equinor with 7.3 percent. Turkey's TPAO, Japan's Itochu, and India's ONGC Videsh have smaller stakes.
Exxon and Chevron have in recent years increasingly focused on developing shale fields in the United States. Exxon is also set to invest billions in developing a string of large oil discoveries in Guyana, while Chevron is developing the extension of the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, estimated to cost $37 billion. 

The BTC pipeline transports the majority of ACG production from Baku through Georgia to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey.

ZUG, Switzerland (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) wants to grow its building technologies business faster than the overall construction market next year, possibly with help from acquisitions, the business' chief executive Matthias Rebellius said on Tuesday. 
The business, which has its head office in Zug, Switzerland, makes devices and software to control the heating, lighting, energy use and security in so-called smart buildings.
Rebellius said he expected the overall construction market to grow by around 3 percent next year, with Siemens taking market share from rivals that include  Johnson Controls  (N:JCI) and Honeywell (N:HON). 
""We want to grow 1 percentage point above the market,"" he told journalists at an event in Zug, where the business is due to open an office building and production site on Wednesday after investing 250 million Swiss francs ($251 million).
The division is targeting faster growth in Asia, where it currently gets around 10 percent of its sales, as well as focusing on digital buildings - which sense, collect and analyze data to improve their energy use, for example.
During Siemens' 2018 financial year, the building technology business's profit slipped to 755 million euros from 784 million a year earlier, while its sales rose 6 percent to 6.6 billion euros. It achieved a profit margin of 11.4 percent, above its target range of 8 to 11 percent.
Next year, it will be folded into a new division called Smart Infrastructure, taking in parts of Siemens' energy management and digital factories businesses, with a higher profit goal.
The new operating company - one of three under Siemens' new simplified structure announced in August - will have a profit margin corridor of 10 to 15 percent.
Smart Infrastructure will remain a ""central part of the new core"" for Siemens, Rebellius said, and would exploit trends like population growth, urbanization and artificial intelligence.
He said the company would consider acquisitions. During 2018 it bought three companies to boost its expertise in smart buildings.
Siemens would not rule out larger deals, Rebellius said, although acquisitions were not needed to meet the company's goals. He declined to identify potential targets.
Under the new business, which will employ around 71,000 people globally, Rebellius will be chief operating officer and report to Siemens board member Cedrik Neike.

""It's a very, very important component of the European situation,"" Ross told CNBC in an interview. ""If we don't fix the auto and auto part trade deficit and the Chinese trade deficit, we're not going to get anywhere.""
""The timing of this whole thing will largely be driven by what happens in negotiations,"" Ross said. ""China, we don't really import very much in the way of cars but we do import some parts.""
""It's a very, very complicated picture but we're moving along at a very deliberate and very orderly pace,"" he added. 
European automakers are to meet with senior administration officials later Tuesday as the United States considers slapping tariffs on European-made cars. Top executives at Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler  are set to attend, according to the White House.
Over the weekend U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce in the two countries' trade war but there were conflicting statements over whether Beijing was lifting retaliatory tariffs imposed on cars made in the United States. 
Trump said on Sunday that China had agreed to cut import levies on American-made cars. But Chinese media reported Tuesday that Beijing was considering curbing tariffs on U.S.-made cars but gave no details about the extent or timing. 
Asked about the Commerce Department's analysis on whether to impose a 25 percent tariff on European vehicles, Ross said its report was undergoing normal review.
Domestically, the administration was grappling with the political aftermath of General Motors Co's (N:GM) announcement last week that it will close five plants in North America, including in the United States, and slash 15,000 jobs.
Trump has threatened to eliminate U.S. subsidies for GM, such as tax credits for their electric vehicles, and said new auto tariffs that could prevent such closures were being studied.
On Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration wants to end subsidies for electric cars.
Ross told CNBC it was important to keep a lot of electric car manufacturing in the United States. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network on Tuesday he hoped GM could find other uses for the U.S. factories it is closing. 

Automakers have warned for months that U.S. tariffs would cost jobs and raise prices and several have said they are worried that GM's closures could prompt Trump to impose auto tariffs more quickly.

1298,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 09:29AM ET</span>",The longest bull run in stock-market history is on its last legs — and a 'deep and prolonged correction' is coming,"The  longest bull run in US stock-market history is on its last legs, according to one Wall Street bank.
""In our view, the bullish cycle that began in 2009 is ending,"" Societe Generale's technical team, led by Stéphanie Aymès, said in a note sent out to clients on Monday.
""Precisely, the famous wave 5, i.e. the last wave of the cycle according to Elliott Wave Principles, has met its key objectives on the S&P500 and Nasdaq. The occurrence of bearish divergences on long-dated indicators and possibly the beginnings of bearish reversal patterns (Head and Shoulders) suggest that the US equity indices may be topping out and that a distribution phase is commencing.""
The Elliott Wave Principles identify up-and-down trends in the market using the assumption that human behavior moves markets in identifiable cycles, especially as traders act like a herd. What goes up eventually comes down. A complete cycle has eight waves — the first five (numbered one through five) are the impulsive waves, while the last three (labeled A, B, and C) are the corrective waves.
The S&P 500 has seen nearly 10 years of gains after bottoming out in March 2009. Along the way it has experienced six corrections — or declines of at least 10%, and a few more close calls — but what is about to transpire has the looks of something bigger.
According to Soc Gen, the recent halting of bullish momentum just shy of the initial target for the fifth and final wave of the cycle (just shy of 3,000) resembles what happened just before the sharp sell-offs in the first quarters of 2016 and 2018. The selling that ensued erased 25% to 30% of the previous up move, and that is what Societe Generale thinks will most likely happen here. When support breaks down, expect a ""deep and prolonged correction,"" the bank said, without giving a specific target.
Soc Gen's call goes against the grain of what most of the other Wall Street banks are saying. Strategists surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting the S&P 500 to close out next year at 3,052 — about 9% above where it ended Monday. But that's not to say that everyone is on board with the idea of a higher stock market in 2019.

The  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Michael Wilson, who has been warning of a ""rolling bear market"" all year, thinks most of the declines have already occurred, with the market having fallen by as much as 11.47% from its September peak.
""The Rolling Bear market is now better understood by the consensus; and more importantly, it is better priced, with forward P/Es falling 18% from peak to trough,"" he wrote in a recent note. ""In short, while 90% of the price damage has been done by this bear, we've likely only served 50% of the time.""
Wilson says that there is more than a 50% chance of a modest earnings recession in 2019 but that the market should look past that as the Federal Reserve pauses its interest-rate-hike cycle in the middle of next year. He has a 2019 year-end S&P 500 target of 2,750 — just below its current level."
1299,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>",Special Report: Little lab on the prairie clears path to big 'clean coal' profits,"By Tim McLaughlin
(Reuters) - “Clean” coal is a rich vein for American investors to mine, thanks to a lucrative subsidy offered by the U.S. government. For many producers of the fuel, the path to profit leads through a laboratory at the University of North Dakota.
The school’s Energy and Environmental Research Center reported earning about $5 million in fiscal 2015-16 performing laboratory tests that qualify clean-coal producers for the subsidy. On any given day, EERC technicians take a sample of up to one ton of the coal from a producer and burn it in a miniature boiler to determine whether it reduces a specific pollutant enough to make the grade.
A stamp of approval from EERC, or a handful of other labs serving the industry, unlocks a tax credit worth more than $7 a ton to producers and their investors. The subsidy, enjoyed by more than 50 clean-coal operations stretching from West Virginia to Wyoming, costs U.S. taxpayers about $1 billion annually.
Technically speaking, EERC’s services aren’t necessary to win the credit. Producers simply need to prove that their product, also known as refined coal, is cutting their emissions of targeted pollutants – a 20 percent cut in nitrogen oxide output plus a 40 percent reduction in mercury. To do that, they can submit the comprehensive data that’s measured around-the-clock at America’s smokestacks – in real-world conditions, instead of a lab – and reported regularly to the Environmental Protection Agency.
But almost all investors choose instead to pay laboratories like EERC for testing that lasts one day, according to industry executives and disclosures by refined coal producers to environmental regulators.
The reason: The lab results almost always show a bigger cut in pollution than the real-world data. And the reductions demonstrated in the labs often do not translate to actual pollution reductions at power plants, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data, interviews with utility executives, and disclosures by power plants.
The testing regimen casts doubt on whether the subsidy works as intended, said Ron Sahu, an environmental engineer who has consulted with utilities, the EPA and the U.S. Justice Department on power plant emissions.
“That’s a huge leap to give a tax credit based on results from a highly idealized lab test,” he said.
John Harju, the EERC’s vice president of strategic partnerships, said the tests are valid and objective measures of performance.
“We do the tests, and the results are what they are,” he said.
Refined coal appears effective in reducing mercury emissions at actual power plants. But it shows little sign of reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide, or NOx, a key element in creating smog and acid rain and a primary target of the subsidy program, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data, interviews with industry officials, and regulatory disclosures.
Between 2009, before utilities began burning refined coal, and 2017, the last year for which full-year data is available, NOx pollution rates declined 19 percent among power plants burning refined coal, compared to 29 percent at plants burning raw coal, according to the Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data. Over the same period, 22 of the 56 U.S. utilities that burned refined coal actually recorded higher NOx emissions rates. Only 18 of them recorded a cut of 20 percent or more.
“It’s one of those things that should come with a label that says, ‘Mileage may vary in the field,’” said Martin Hopper, general manager of the MSR Public Power Agency in Modesto, California, which co-owns New Mexico’s San Juan Generating Station.
The Internal Revenue Service, which administers the tax credit program, agreed to accept lab results from subsidy applicants a decade ago. That move came after investors argued to U.S. Treasury and IRS officials in 2007 that lab-controlled tests make it easier to isolate how refined coal performs, eliminating complicating factors at play in a full-sized boiler, according to David Lowman, a partner at law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, who represented the industry in the negotiations.
The IRS declined to comment on its decision. “When issuing guidance, the IRS and Treasury invite comments concerning our requirements and, based on this, updates can be made to better administer the law,” the U.S. tax agency said in a statement.
FAILING REAL-WORLD TESTS
Over the past decade, the IRS has handed out billions of dollars of refined coal subsidies to companies on the basis of test results that show they are producing a cleaner-burning form of coal.
The semi-annual lab tests often don’t reflect the reality at power plants. That’s because plants generally do not operate under optimal conditions for reducing NOx while burning refined coal, according utility officials and power plant disclosures to environmental regulators.
A typical power plant’s NOx emission rate often fluctuates as operators adjust the flow of air to the combustion chamber and other equipment to meet demands on the facility to produce electricity. Coal that burns hot and fast during wide-open air flow, for example – a setting used when demand surges – will produce more NOx pollution than coal burning at lower temperatures with lower air flow.
In 2010, the IRS said it altered its testing requirements in a way that allowed labs to use different air control settings in the two different tests needed to compare refined coal to raw coal, according to a January 2011 article by two Ernst & Young executives in The Tax Adviser magazine. Although the agency’s reasoning for the change was unclear, the article said the practical effect would be to make the tests easier to pass.
The IRS and EERC declined to comment on the policy change. The EERC said in a statement to Reuters that it has used substantially reduced airflows while burning refined coal, resulting in lower NOx emissions for the same energy output.
The price of emissions credits under the U.S. cap and trade program can also influence a power plant’s rate of pollution. Coal plants that purchase the credits are allowed to emit more pollution, and in recent years it has been cheaper to buy credits than to run pollution-control equipment at peak effectiveness.
As a result, a plant burning refined coal can see its NOx levels spike if pollution controls are turned down or off, regardless of the type of coal it burns, EPA data shows. 
“Refined coal is just one of many factors that influence real-time NOx levels,” said Erin Culbert, a spokeswoman for  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK), the largest U.S. utility.
And when utilities decide to burn refined coal, tax credit investors – often Wall Street firms – have no control over how utility owners run their coal plants.
Several utilities have told environmental regulators that they tried to demonstrate pollution reductions big enough to qualify for the subsidy at actual plants, but failed, according to their disclosures.
During a trial run using refined coal at the Stanton Energy Center in Orlando, Florida, in 2010, NOx emission rates increased by 10 percent compared to raw coal, instead of declining. Two other trial runs at Stanton that year proved inconclusive, according to a copy of the results viewed by Reuters. The plant ultimately decided not to burn refined coal, according to regulatory filings.
Stanton declined to comment for this story.
Coal plants achieve most of their reduction in smog pollution through investments in other technology, including equipment that works like the catalytic converter in a car or truck to convert NOx into benign nitrogen and water. Or they cut pollutants by simply switching from coal to cleaner natural gas, or by using a mix of both fuels.
The Brunner Island power plant in Pennsylvania, for example, reduced its NOx emission rate by 63 percent in 2017 compared to 2016, thanks to new natural gas burners and piping, said Todd Martin, a spokesman for Talen Energy, owner of the coal plant.
Some utilities have conceded that they can’t replicate the lab test results they use to win the subsidy at their power plants.
St. Louis-based utility  Ameren Corp  (NYSE:AEE) told regulators in 2013 that it was not confident that a 21 percent NOx reduction achieved by refined coal at EERC could be replicated in the field if it burned the product, according to correspondence with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources related to permitting for a facility near St Louis.
Ameren has two plants in the state that have generated refined coal tax credits for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Alabama-based Coal Emissions Reduction Technologies LLC, investors in the facilities that produce clean coal ultimately burned by Ameren.
Ameren declined to comment on refined coal’s ability to reduce NOx. The Alabama investment group did not return phone calls seeking comment.
The two plants burned 6.7 million tons of refined coal in 2017, according to EIA. At the 2018 tax credit amount of $7.03 per ton, using that much refined coal would yield nearly $47 million in annual tax credits.
Ameren said it uses a number of different strategies to reduce pollution at its plants, including refined coal. “Those strategies have resulted in … significant reductions in (sulfur dioxide), NOx and mercury emissions,” Ameren said in a statement.
Whelan Energy Center in Hastings, Nebraska, also burns refined coal, but mainly as a way to cut mercury emissions and to benefit from the subsidy. Plant officials never considered using clean coal for reducing smog pollution because they don’t believe it’s effective, said Marty Stange, environmental supervisor at Hastings Utilities, an owner of the plant.
“We never really looked at it for NOx reduction,” he said.
The laboratory testing is a much safer bet for companies to qualify for the refined coal tax credit. It’s unusual for a clean-coal sample to fail an emissions test in a lab setting, said Murray Abbott, president of Chem-Mod LLC, the leading supplier of chemicals used for refined coal’s emission reductions. Murray said plants usually can’t reproduce the cuts his company’s chemicals achieve in lab results because utilities typically run their plants with power production and costs in mind, not just emissions reductions.
“It’s tough to show the same level of emission reductions at full scale,” he said.
GO-TO LAB
The EERC lab in Grand Forks is a popular destination for refined coal tax-credit investors, according to contract disclosures by the school.
Utility DTE, for example, paid EERC $581,000 to conduct an undisclosed number of refined coal emissions tests at its North Dakota lab in fiscal 2015-2016, according to EERC contract disclosures. DTE's refined coal operations generated $103 million in tax credits that year, according to DTE's annual report.
DTE declined to comment on the testing of its coal at EERC labs.
EERC was well placed to become the refined coal industry’s laboratory for testing after the subsidy was adopted in 2004. EERC was officially founded in 1951 as the Robertson Lignite Research Laboratory, a federal facility under the U.S. Bureau of Mines that tested the qualities of different types of coal.
The $5 million in revenue EERC generated in the 2016-16 fiscal year amounted to 14 percent of its total grants and contracts, according to University of North Dakota budget disclosures.
“It's a fair chunk of work around here,” said the EERC’s Harju.
Highlighting EERC’s central role, Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota referred to its lab testing when he introduced legislation in February to extend the refined coal tax credit after it expires in 2021.
“This would not only benefit the coal-generating power plants in North Dakota that use refined coal, it will also support the work of the EERC, which provides services to facilities around the nation to verify that the refined coal meets the standards required to claim the credit,” Hoeven said in a press release.
And in April, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry named Harju to the National Coal Council, a federal advisory board for formulating coal policy.
EERC’s small test boilers are designed to mimic the performance of actual power plants, lab officials say. Its combustion test facility has an output capacity of less than 1 megawatt per hour, compared to at least several hundred megawatts per hour at a typical coal plant. The lab uses several devices to simulate pollution control equipment in place at a utility, such as scrubbers.
Asked whether the boiler settings are fine-tuned to improve refined coal’s environmental performance, Harju said he was not an expert in such technical details. EERC declined to comment on how often its clients fail to pass its laboratory tests, but Chem-Mod’s Abbott said such failures are rare.
EERC officials declined to provide further technical specifics about its testing process.

“We’re just an independent validator of performance,” Harju said. “It’s an arm’s-length effort.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) is teaming up with a new U.S. partner,  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), to try to crack the U.S. military air tanker market nearly eight years after losing out to rival Boeing (N:BA) in a bitter battle to supply refueling planes to the U.S. Air Force.
Airbus and Lockheed, the biggest U.S. arms maker, said on Tuesday they had signed an agreement to meet the growing demand for aerial refueling for the U.S. military.
The agreement marks Airbus's first major foray into the huge U.S. military market since its failed 2012 bid to merge with Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and its large U.S. unit.
It kicks off a rerun of an epic battle between Airbus and Boeing, the world largest planemakers, that stretched for nearly a decade and saw two former Boeing executives sent to federal prison for ethics violations.
Airbus, previously teamed with U.S. weapons maker  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC), in 2008 had won a $35 billion contract to build its MRTT aerial refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force, only to see the deal overturned amid political pressure.
The U.S. Air Force re-ran the competition and Boeing ultimately won a $49 billion contract in 2011 to build 179 767-based tankers for the U.S. Air Force, but it has missed deadlines on the resulting KC-46A program and piled up some $3 billion in costs.
Now Airbus will work with Lockheed and go after the next possible aircraft and refueling service orders. 
""By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges,"" said Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson in a statement.
Outgoing Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the two firms made ""a great industry team.""
Militaries rely on tankers - which are essentially flying gas stations - to extend their reach by refueling combat aircraft during military exercises or military missions. Demand has grown given the large number of longer-range military operations underway around the world.
Airbus is banking on the international success of its A330-based Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), which has been selected by 12 countries, including Australia, Britain and South Korea. The aircraft is already refueling or capable of refueling most major U.S. combat airplanes, including the stealthy F-35 fighter jet.
Lockheed, builder of the F-35 and the C-130J transport plane that can also be used as a tanker, will give Airbus a strong partner for future U.S. bids, the companies said.
""This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise,"" said Michele Evans, the new head of Lockheed's aeronautics division. 
The U.S. Air Force, which wants to ultimately replace its entire fleet of over 400 tankers, is examining ways to meet growing demand for aerial refueling with possible fee-for-service arrangements, purchases of hundreds of additional aircraft, and the future development of a stealthy tanker.
Senior executives from Airbus and Lockheed agreed in Madrid to jointly explore all those opportunities, but are still working on details of their future cooperation, according to sources familiar with the matter.

WARSAW/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) is ramping up a new subsidiary with weaker labor rights to better compete in eastern Europe, infuriating staff and unions by bypassing concessions granted during a year of industrial strife.
But a key element of the plan, forcing staff to move to self-employment contracts, is being probed by Polish authorities and a law to allow contractors to join unions -- and potentially push for concessions granted in Western Europe -- is due to enter force there in January.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has seen almost a third wiped off its share value in 12 months since strike threats led it to recognize unions for the first time. Investors fear better staff conditions could undermine its business model, among other issues. 
While hailing progress in securing deals on improved conditions with unions across Europe, management is planning the rapid expansion of Polish-registered Ryanair Sun, where staff are self-employed contractors, a model Ryanair has largely phased out at its main airline under union pressure. 
The model denies staff normal employment rights such as paid sick leave and effectively blocks union representation, staff and union representatives said.
""On the one hand, Ryanair is busy reaching out to the unions to show a new socially responsible face,"" said Philip von Schöppenthau, secretary general of pilot group the European Cockpit Association.
""But at the same time they are busy working in the opposite direction building up a potentially union-free -- by design union-free -- company, Ryanair Sun.""
Ryanair counters that many staff are happy with contractor status, which they say gives them higher pay. It says the contracts are standard in Polish airlines and that the unit's rapid expansion -- from five to 20 planes next year -- would not be possible if conditions were not competitive. 
""It's not necessarily the best model for union membership growth, so I would expect the unions to say negative things ... But look, it's the way the Polish market works,"" Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs told Reuters in an interview.
SCALE OF MOVE
Ryanair Sun is currently only operating in Poland, Ryanair's largest market in eastern Europe, and Ryanair declined to say whether it planned to expand the unit to other markets. 
But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in July he planned to grow Ryanair Sun and Austrian unit Laudamotion ""as quickly as they're able to grow"". In October he told investors the two units would drive ""much of"" the airline's growth. 
With more than 200 planes on order over five years, Ryanair has the capacity to build both units into mid-sized European airlines with tens of millions of passengers a year each. 
While Laudamotion has signed a collective agreement with its unions, HSBC Bank described Ryanair's new multi-unit structure as ""an attempt to counter the pressures of unionization"". Goodbody stockbrokers said Ryanair Sun gave Ryanair ""the chance to create an ultra-low cost business"". 
O'Leary made the decision to recognize unions under the threat of a mass Christmas strike last year, after months of cancellations and an extremely tight global market for pilots. With several union deals done and small airline failures increasing pilot supply, the airline is under less pressure now.

EASTERN EXPANSION
Ryanair has singled out central and eastern Europe as a key market for growth, split between ""essentially just two airlines"" -- Ryanair and union-free, Hungary-based Wizz, Jacobs said.
Ryanair says its staff costs were on par with Wizz before the staffing crisis, at 5 euros per customer flown, but have since grown to 6 euros. 
While Ryanair Sun will help Ryanair compete with Wizz in eastern Europe, Wizz is likely to face pressure from unions as it moves into Western Europe, Jacobs said. 
Non-unionization also means Ryanair Sun avoids collective labor agreements that can put restrictions on transfers to other bases. 
Moving planes and crew quickly between airports helps give Ryanair the lowest airport costs in Europe -- accounting for as much as two-thirds of their cost advantage over some rivals.
Unions say Ryanair is using the unit to pressure staff in negotiations in other countries. When Irish pilots threatened to strike earlier this year, Ryanair announced it was cutting capacity in Ireland and offered staff jobs at Ryanair Sun. 
THREAT TO MODEL 
Prospects for Ryanair Sun and its contractor model will depend in part on how regulators and staff react in the coming months. 
Ryanair announced in September that it was liquidating its Polish bases and would offer staff jobs at Ryanair Sun. A memo dated Oct. 1 and sent to all pilots in Poland by Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said pilots who do not sign the contracts would not be offered a conversion course for Ryanair Sun ""and so we will have no jobs for them in Poland"".  
Cabin crew were offered the choice of signing the new contracts or taking alternative jobs in the United Kingdom or Germany on the same terms, but crew said the cost of living made the option impractical. 
Within days, 300 cabin crew had joined a new union, CWR, which Ryanair has not recognized. Pilots have not yet attempted to unionize. 
Ryanair has since convinced over 100 cabin crew to overcome initial reluctance and sign the contracts. CWR said that was partly through the dismissal of a handful of cabin crew workers on probationary contracts. Ryanair declined to comment. 
At least 50 cabin crew are still refusing to sign the contracts under which ""any representation such as unions cease to exist"" said Paulo Conceicao, the secretary of the CWR union.
But that could change when a Polish law comes into force on Jan. 1 that will give broader powers to employees who want to unionize.  
One union source told Reuters the law would allow the unions to consider strikes. Two others said the formation of the first dedicated pilot union in Poland may follow some time next year.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 07:45AM ET</span>",WTO warns of trade crisis as German car bosses face U.S. tariff talks,"By Edward Taylor
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - The global system of international trade is in crisis, the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned on Tuesday, as German car bosses gathered in Washington hoping to stave off potential tariffs on U.S. imports of luxury cars. 
Top officials from  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have been summoned to the United States to meet White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to discuss U.S. efforts to rebalance global trade.
The meeting comes after months of warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump that he might impose big tariffs on imported cars, and days after he agreed a truce in a broader trade war with China.
""The system is in crisis mode and how this plays out remains to be seen,"" WTO Deputy Director General Karl Brauner told the Handelsblatt automotive summit in Wolfsburg, Germany. 
Global trade and welfare cannot continue when large countries take unilateral action which deviates from common rules and principles, Brauner warned. 
""You need legal certainty and predictability, and if everybody just does whatever they want, it's over,"" Brauner said, adding the visit by German car bosses may help Trump's administration understand the impact of tariffs on global trade.
Trump warned German carmakers in 2017 he could impose a 35 percent tax on vehicles imported to the United States unless there was some ""rebalancing"" of trade. 
There were too many Mercedes-Benz cars rolling down New York's Fifth Avenue, Trump said, lamenting that Europeans were not buying enough Chevrolets.
The White House's demand to meet German car bosses comes despite the fact it is the European Commission that formally handles trade negotiations on behalf of the European Union.
To try to assuage Trump officials, German car bosses will outline plans for increasing the proportion of components produced in the United States.
Volkswagen (VW) will reiterate it is looking to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity to include electric cars.
German carmakers are among the largest net exporters of vehicles to and from the United States. BMW and Mercedes, for example, build most of their sport utility vehicles in U.S. plants and import luxury limousines built in Germany to America.
BMW has its largest global car factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, while VW has a plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Mercedes builds cars in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
""The German car bosses will not try to negotiate international trade policy, but they will ensure that the people in Washington have the same understanding about the impact of their policies as the mayor of Chattanooga,"" Brauner said.

Around 10,000 local jobs depend on each model built in Chattanooga, the city's mayor Andy Berke told the Wolfsburg conference in a Webcast interview.

(Reuters) - Earlier this year, the chief financial officer of global insurance giant Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (N:AJG) explained to analysts how the company had turned a little-known U.S. energy subsidy into a profit machine, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line.
The money came from the U.S. “clean coal” tax credit, a provision of the American Jobs Act of 2004 meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation’s power plants.
To capitalize on the subsidy, A.J. Gallagher arranged investor partnerships to produce vast quantities of refined coal, as the fuel is known in the industry, for utilities across the nation, splitting the benefit of the lucrative government incentive – now worth more than $7 per ton.
“Our return on investment is staggering,” CFO Douglas Howell told analysts in the March 14 call. “Oh, 200 percent, 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. I mean, just because it costs so little to develop” clean coal facilities.
A.J. Gallagher’s experience reflects a truth about the U.S. refined coal tax credit, a subsidy that now costs taxpayers about $1 billion a year: While coal mining firms, utility companies and power consumers can benefit indirectly from the subsidy, the big winners are a diverse group of investors – ranging from Wall Street’s most powerful banks to insurers, meat packers and drug makers – who identified the incentive as an easy way to make money.
Over the past decade, these companies have financed the construction of facilities to produce refined coal, which are situated next to coal-fired power plants and typically cost about $4 million to $6 million each to develop. They then sell the resulting coal to utilities below cost, but make eye-popping returns from the subsidy rather than the underlying business, according to regulatory documents and interviews.
A.J. Gallagher’s Howell took credit for designing a business model to maximize profits from the subsidy in his March call with analysts.
“It is our machine,” he said. “We developed it. We pioneered it.”
The company has accumulated about $850 million worth of tax credits, mostly from its side business in taxpayer-supported refined coal, Howell said on an Oct. 25th conference call with investors and analysts.
“And at current production levels” of refined coal, he said, “that may total another $700 million through 2021.”
Howell declined to comment for this story. A.J. Gallagher spokeswoman Linda Collins minimized the importance of clean coal to the company.
“Refined coal is not a part of our core brokerage and risk management business,” Collins said in an email.
Refined coal activities, however, accounted for 25 percent of the company’s $5.28 billion in total revenue during the first nine months of this year, according to AJ Gallagher financial statements. They also made up about a fifth of the company’s $516 million in net earnings attributable to controlling interests during that period.
While the subsidy has proven a boon for investors, it has often failed to achieve the intended reductions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, the primary contributor to smog and acid rain. Utilities that burn refined coal have trailed competitors burning raw coal in lowering NOx emissions, and 22 of 56 plants burning refined coal have seen NOx emission rates rise instead of fall, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data vetted by industry experts.
The refined coal tax subsidy is scheduled to expire in 2021. But lawmakers, including Republican Senator John Hoeven of coal-producing North Dakota, have introduced legislation to extend it another 10 years. They argue it helps the environment, extends the life of the ailing coal industry – a centerpiece of the Trump administration’s energy policy – and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap, subsidized source of coal.
“This is really an incentive to operate in a way that’s more environmentally friendly while keeping power costs low,” said Hoeven, whose state sits atop an 800-year supply of lignite coal.
If the extension goes through, those best placed to gain from the subsidy are an eclectic list of refined coal investors, including Wall Street banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (N:JPM) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF); wealth management giant Fidelity Investments; drugmaker Mylan NV (N:MYL); U.S. affiliates of global commodities trader Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG); industrial supplier W.W. Grainger Inc (N:GWW); Kansas-based pork producer  Seaboard Corp  (N:SEB); and ethanol plant investor Rex American Resources Corp (N:REX), according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, state environmental regulators and the U.S. Tax Court.
CapitalOne, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Mylan, Noble, Rex American, Seaboard and W.W. Grainger declined to comment on refined coal’s impact on NOx pollution.
These and other refined coal investors stand to gain at least $10 billion in tax incentives over the next decade if the law is extended, based on the current annual consumption of refined coal and the existing level of the inflation-adjusted tax credit.
BIRTH OF THE BUSINESS
As originally drawn in 2004, the refined coal tax credit required producers to increase raw coal’s market value by 50 percent to qualify for the subsidy. The market-value clause made cost-conscious utilities unwilling to buy the specialized product. Prospects for the clean coal business were dim.
But in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, two U.S. senators changed the landscape by deleting the market-value clause – a subtle tweak tucked away in the massive $700 billion U.S. financial rescue package.
A.J. Gallagher, along with utility firms  Ameren Corp  and DTE Energy, also had been lobbying on the issue of refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings, though it is unclear if they lobbied specifically on the market-value clause. Officials at Ameren and DTE declined to comment on the lobbying.
The policy edit – by Democrat Max Baucus of coal mining state Montana and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa – made it possible for refined coal producers to receive the subsidy even if they sold their product to utilities below cost. That paved the way for investors to set up operations and to ultimately make billions of dollars building refined coal to its current share of about a fifth of the U.S. coal market.
Baucus said he does not remember the change to the refined coal tax credit. “It was a tax-credit blizzard; a deluge of credits was being discussed,” Baucus said. “It’s very easy to change the code to give credit to companies to spur investment. The code gets crusted with barnacles of credits, and then they’re removed. It’s the natural ebb and flow of things.”
Grassley declined to comment for this story.
The subsidy is now worth more than $7 a ton, an amount that covers losses on the discounted pricing and the operations that produce refined coal, while often leaving a profit that can amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year per investor, according to disclosures by tax credit investors. Because some of the operating expenses of running a refined coal facility are deductible, the tax credit’s effective value can top $9 a ton.
Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most powerful banks, is currently generating estimated annual gross tax credits of about $50 million from two Missouri power plants alone, according data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing refined coal consumption patterns at the plants. Goldman declined to comment.
“It was virtually impossible to make money producing clean coal for utilities,” said Roger Jones, senior counsel at McDermott Will & Emery LLP in Chicago, who has represented refined coal tax investors. “But as soon as the credit was there, people thought about capital-raising to engage in this activity.”
After the tax credit was revised, A.J. Gallagher led the race to build refined coal facilities, constructing them next to power plants that burned the most coal in the country so as to maximize credit volumes.
It now has investments in 34 refined coal facilities in the United States, along with a 46.5 percent controlling stake in Chem-Mod LLC, a leading supplier of chemicals used to refine raw coal, according to A.J. Gallagher SEC filings.
Gallagher’s main rival, Colorado-based Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc (O:ADES), holds interests in 19 refined coal facilities with tax credit investors, through a joint venture with Goldman Sachs and NexGen Resources Corp. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs account for most of those investors, SEC filings show.
Goldman Sachs, in 2011, purchased a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, a refined coal operator called Tinuum Group LLC, formerly known as Clean Coal Solutions, for $60 million. Advanced Emissions owns a 42.5 percent stake in Tinuum, whose operations produced and sold about 60 million tons of refined coal during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, SEC disclosures show.
DRUG, TRASH FIRMS GET INTO COAL
Some partnerships include players even farther afield from the energy business. In one of refined coal’s earliest and biggest financial commitments, trash collector Waste Management Inc (N:WM) teamed up with JPMorgan Chase to invest in the refined coal facility at Coal Creek Station in North Dakota.
The bank and the trash company invested in a facility that treats coal by preheating it in a process that dries out several million tons of soggy lignite coal each year, increasing its energy output. Electric cooperative Great River Energy, the owner of the plant, agreed to lease its refined coal facility to JPMorgan and Waste Management for $530 million over 16 years, according to a January 2011 deal disclosed by the co-op.JPMorgan and Waste Management declined to comment for this story.
Another big beneficiary is drug maker Mylan. Refined coal tax credits were the second biggest component in producing a tax benefit of $358.3 million in 2016, according to Mylan’s annual report. That tax benefit lifted its consolidated earnings for the year to $480 million, from $121.7 million.
Power plant owners typically sell their coal at cost to refined coal operations controlled by tax credit investors. Once the coal is treated with chemicals or dried out at an on-site refined coal facility, the tax credit investors sell the coal back to the power plants at a discount that can be anywhere from 75 cents to $2 per ton – a way to ensure utilities get some benefit from the subsidy, according to agreements filed with state regulators. Central-Appalachian coal, which has high energy content for power generation, costs about $75 a ton.
Coal plant owners also may structure deals with refined coal producers to collect coal-handling and licensing fees or to charge rent through leases of their land used for the facilities, the disclosures show.
Last year, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, a unit of PPL Corp (N:PPL), struck a deal with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs to burn refined coal at the utility’s Ghent power station. The utility stands to receive $10 million a year in incentives and would bear no expense for running the refined coal operations, according to disclosures with Kentucky regulators.
For Goldman and any other tax credit investors in the deal, the gross annual tax credit, before refined coal operating expenses and incentives for the utility, is $39 million, Reuters estimates. That estimate is based on Ghent’s average annual coal consumption of 5.5 million tons multiplied by the $7.03 per ton tax credit.
Goldman declined to comment on the revenue or profit it derives from clean-coal tax credits.
Utility companies themselves haven’t been in the vanguard of capitalizing on the refined coal subsidy. That’s because the original wording of the refined coal tax credit, passed in 2004, stipulated that the producer of refined coal had to sell it to an “unrelated person.” So, utilities couldn’t invest in clean coal and sell it to themselves.
The IRS issued new guidance in 2009, however, that opened the door for affiliates of utilities like Detroit-based DTE Energy to control or take stakes in refined coal production facilities in recent years. DTE has received some $639 million in refined coal tax credits since 2012, SEC disclosures show. DTE declined to comment for this story.
PAYING NO TAXES
In today’s thriving clean coal industry, A.J. Gallagher’s early moves to monetize the tax credit seem prescient. Months before the subsidy first entered the tax code in 2004, the company paid $300,000 for a 5 percent ownership stake in Chem-Mod, which at the time was developing chemical treatments designed to reduce coal pollution. A core group of five people at A.J. Gallagher was overseeing the move into the business, according to the company’s disclosures to investors.
A.J. Gallagher was among several investors who paid Washington firms to lobby on refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings. In 2008, before Congress modified the refined coal tax credit to erase the market-value clause, the company paid two law firms – Winston & Strawn, and Steptoe & Johnson – to lobby on “refined coal” and “energy and tax” issues, respectively. The lobbying disclosure documents do not detail what specific objective the companies had in their lobbying activities.
Officials from those law firms involved in the lobbying declined to comment.
David Lowman, a partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, was lobbying on refined coal on behalf of a different company at the time. He said the refined coal industry successfully pushed to have the market value clause eliminated. In return, the industry agreed to double the pollution reduction requirement on mercury and sulfur dioxide to 40 percent from 20 percent.
By the end of 2008, Gallagher had built up a 42 percent stake in Chem-Mod for a total investment of $13.3 million, according to company disclosures. Now it was ready to launch into developing facilities.
The dive into a newly subsidized business was part of the company’s strategy to find profits in taxpayer-financed incentives. Dating to the 1980s, Arthur J. Gallagher has sought out opportunities, for example, in subsidized low-income housing and the so-called synfuel tax credit, designed to promote domestically-produced synthetic fuels that can reduce U.S. import dependence.
Gallagher’s approach to refined coal, however, has made it a heavyweight, and it has been pivotal in recruiting tax investors to help finance refined coal operations throughout the country. In 2009, it negotiated partnerships with Fidelity and the U.S. subsidiary of France’s Schneider Electric SE (PA:SCHN) to produce refined coal for a utility at three South Carolina power plants, U.S. Tax Court disclosures show. Gallagher also has struck deals to put refined coal operations inside the fence of power plants owned by DTE and St. Louis-based utility Ameren Corp (N:AEE).
Net earnings from its “clean energy” investments are estimated to be $115 million in 2018, or 17 times more than what the company reported in 2010. Looking ahead, the company can carry forward its stockpile of $850 million in credits to reduce its taxes in future years.
“We will not be paying much, if any, U.S. federal income tax for many years to come,” CFO Howell said this spring during a conference call with investors.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa (N:V) and Mastercard (N:MA) have offered to cut merchants' charges for non-EU credit and debit cards by at least 40 percent to end an EU antitrust investigation, part of a decades-long crackdown by the European Commission against such fees.
The EU competition enforcer said interchange fees in which the merchant's bank pays a charge to the cardholder's bank which then subsequently passes on the cost to the merchant, result in higher consumer prices.
Visa, the world's largest payments network operator, and No. 2 player Mastercard have proposed a 0.2 percent fee on debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3 percent fee on credit card payments, the Commission said on Tuesday.
For online payments, debit card charges would be 1.15 percent and 1.50 percent for credit cards. The case affects foreign tourists using their cards in the 28-country bloc. 

Third parties have a month to provide feedback before the Commission decides whether to accept the offer or demand a bigger fee reduction. Reuters reported on the offer from Visa and Mastercard last month.

Daimler said Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche will attend the meeting, while BMW said Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter will be in attendance. Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess is also planning to attend.
They are scheduled to meet with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The automakers, previous targets of U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism, are hoping to head off tariffs on German cars, following fresh threats from Trump to slap more tax on vehicles assembled in the European Union.
The U.S. currently imposes import tariffs on cars assembled in the EU of 2.5%, compared with 10% tariffs for U.S.-built cars entering the European trading bloc.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) were all off by around 2% at 6:45AM ET (11:45 GMT) in Frankfurt, while Continental (DE:CONG) and  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p) were down 4.2% and 2.5% respectively.
The losses weighed on the broader European auto sector index, which fell 1.8% in midday trade. Shares in Europe's auto sector have dropped almost 25% so far this year.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",GM moves to challenge Ford in U.S. commercial fleet sales,"By Nick Carey
FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is intensifying its attack on rival Ford Motor Co's (N:F) lead in sales to U.S. commercial fleets to prop up profit margins amid weakening consumer demand, according to executives at the No. 1 U.S. automaker.
GM is counting on new medium-duty Silverados - outfitted as tow trucks, utility bucket trucks and delivery trucks - to lift demand for its light-duty trucks and cars. Automakers estimate for every medium-duty truck a corporate customer buys, they purchase up to six pickup trucks, SUVs, or passenger cars.
The need for automakers to bolster U.S. sales and keep plants humming was highlighted last week when GM slated five North American factories for potential closure, including two making the type of sedan that has fallen out of favor with American consumers. Ford announced it would shuffle workers from slower to busier plants.
Most major automakers on Monday also reported lower U.S. November sales.
But a 24.1 percent jump in commercial fleet sales in November versus the same month in 2017 helped GM offset a 1 percent retail sales drop, according to a source briefed on figures GM does not make public on a monthly basis. 
GM North America chief Alan Batey told Reuters in a recent interview the automaker has pursued a long-term strategy to cut lower-margin rental fleet sales and boost more lucrative commercial sales.
GM's rental sales are around 10 percent of total sales this year, down from 15.8 percent in 2013, according to industry data. In the same period, GM's commercial sales have risen to more than 11 percent from 7.8 percent of sales.
Batey said production of GM's medium-duty trucks, which begins this week under a partnership with truck maker  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV) as an extension of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck model line, is a milestone in the automaker's move to increase market share. 
GM exited the segment during its bankruptcy in 2009. It originally announced the planned Navistar venture in September 2015.
GM and Ford compete for business from companies like engineering-services firm U.S. Infrastructure Co, which has around 9,000 vehicles, mostly light-duty Chevrolet Colorado pickup trucks. USIC's workers mark cable lines, water pipes and other underground infrastructure before contractors start digging holes in the ground. 
USIC fleet manager Phil Samuelson said in a recent interview the company needs around 20 medium-duty trucks, fast. GM won his order by promising to accelerate production of his trucks. 
Otherwise, Samuelson would have tried Ford or  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV. (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) 
""We have a great relationship with GM and we saw no reason not to continue that,"" he said.
Satisfying customers like USIC could help GM next year when Ford launches its Ranger pickup, a direct competitor for the Colorado.
Rising commercial fleet sales have lifted GM's net profit by $1 billion over the last five years, according to sources familiar with GM's financials.
BOOST FROM TAX OVERHAUL 
Commercial fleet sales are increasingly important as consumer vehicle sales are set to weaken over the next couple of years after an eight-year recovery.
Ford, GM and FCA control around 77 percent of commercial fleet sales for Classes 1 through 6 - from passenger cars to the biggest medium-duty trucks - though Ford dominates at 40 percent, according to data compiled by Cox Automotive for Reuters from non-public sources. GM has around 25 percent market share.
(See Graphic, ""Ford, GM battle for commercial customers"" https://tmsnrt.rs/2QwSWgx )
Ford executives say they have no special plans to counter GM's expanded truck portfolio. ""We're just going to do what we always do,"" said John Ruppert, Ford's general manager for commercial vehicle sales. 
Through November, GM's commercial fleet sales rose 13.5 percent compared with a 5.1 percent increase at Ford. 
U.S. auto retail sales are forecast to fall over the next two years. But commercial fleet sales should rise, partly because of tax write-offs in the 2017 U.S. federal tax overhaul.
""If retail sales come down, your factories are still humming ... if you're selling to commercial fleets,"" said Zohaib Rahim, Cox Automotive's economic and industry insights manager.
DESPERATE NEED
GM's decision to re-enter the medium-duty truck segment was driven by commercial customers that seek several types of vehicle in package deals. 
""If I want a medium-duty truck I end up going to Ford and the chances are I'll also buy my pickup truck from Ford instead of GM,"" said Kenny Vieth, president of sales forecasting firm ACT Research. 
""Dealers desperately need these trucks to go after industries we haven't been able to go to with existing product,"" said John Schwegman, GM's commercial product director.
Keith McCluskey, owner of McCluskey Chevrolet in Cincinnati, Ohio, said his commercial fleets now account for 10 percent of his sales, down from 40 percent when he last sold GM medium-duty trucks.
McCluskey has built a new $8 million service facility partly for commercial customers and aims to sell 1,000 medium-duty trucks annually.

LONDON (Reuters) - On top of the risk that Britain will leave the European Union in March without a transition deal, its government faces an extra headache next year: the biggest debt-refinancing bill in recent history.
Almost 100 billion pounds ($128 billion) of government bonds will mature in the next fiscal year, when Britain needs to repay a host of bonds issued after the financial crisis a decade ago.
In normal times, that would not be an issue. But with Britain due to leave the EU in less than four months, possibly with no transition agreement, it creates fresh doubt in an era of uncertainty for British assets that has few precedents.
Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan has been agreed with the EU but faces deep opposition in parliament, where it faces a vote on Dec. 11, raising the risk of no-deal Brexit economic shock.
The volume of redemptions in the 2019/20 fiscal year -- which starts in April -- is likely to equate to 4.5 percent of nominal gross domestic product, the biggest share since records started in the mid-1990s, before declining in future years.
""It's a huge refinancing exercise. It's going to be quite a big test,"" Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services, said.
The Debt Management Office (DMO) declined to comment.
Gilts are viewed as safe assets, with around 1.1 trillion pounds in circulation besides those accumulated by the Bank of England to power its post-crisis stimulus for the economy.
The average maturity of gilts is around 15 years, more than double the euro zone average, spreading the bulk of Britain's refinancing risk over many years into the future.
But the lack of clarity around the terms of Brexit, due on March 29, comes at an inopportune time. Two bonds, each with more than 36 billion pounds in issue, are due to mature either side of Brexit: first a 4.5 percent gilt on March 7 followed by a 1.75 percent gilt on July 22.
Investors might seek new homes for the money flowing back to them from redeemed British government bonds rather than reinvest in gilts, depending on how Brexit turns out.
""I know a lot of people would say, well that doesn't matter, we get the money redeemed and we just plow it back in the market. But are you going to want to?"" Ostwald said.

KINDNESS OF STRANGERS
A 20-year gilt auction last month brought a hint of nervousness. The DMO had to accept low bids to an extent not seen since the height of the financial crisis.
Foreign demand could be an issue in the event of a so-called hard Brexit. 
After the 2016 Brexit referendum, overseas demand for gilts rose sharply, in part because central banks and sovereign wealth funds wanted to top up their sterling portfolios battered by the pound's plunge.
But a no-deal Brexit could be different. It would quickly affect Britain's economy, from trade links to regulation and foreign investment, in a way the referendum result did not.
About 27 percent of gilts are held overseas. That is a smaller share than in many other European countries, but it is a reminder of how reliant Britain is on the ""kindness of strangers"", as BoE Governor Mark Carney put it.
Most investors still think the most likely possibility is that Britain leaves the EU with a transition deal.
Mike Amey, sterling portfolio manager at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co., said in that case the BoE would probably continue raising interest rates, and sooner than investors expect.
""Two hikes seems on the lower side to us, if you get a cooperative Brexit,"" he said.
Other investors aren't so sure. Alberto Gallo, portfolio manager for the Algebris Macro Credit Fund at Algebris Investments, said the BoE has largely missed its chance and will probably only raise rates once in the next 18 months.
ROLL OVER, BOND HAVEN
Helping gilts is the fact that the BoE will be a big player in the market next year. 
It owns around 40 percent of the volume of gilts maturing in 2019, and its policy is to re-invest redemptions into the market, at least until interest rates reach around 1.5 percent -- double their current level.
But foreign investors might hold off on re-investing, particularly if sterling is volatile, ADM's Ostwald said. 
An active sell-off by foreign investors of existing holdings of bonds, as Italy saw in recent months, remains unlikely, given that Britain's solvency is not in doubt.
""A large amount of redemptions where the money isn't flowing back into the gilt market from those foreign investors is probably the bigger challenge,"" Ostwald said.
In that case, gilt yields could rise, putting extra strain on borrowers in what would already be a difficult economic environment and adding to government borrowing costs.
""Obviously that is not as bad as having active sellers. But nevertheless it means there needs to be more money found from domestic buyers,"" Ostwald said.

Officials from the central bank have begun to strike a more dovish tone, leading traders to pare bets on the pace of hikes and push down the dollar on Tuesday. The yield spread between three- and five-year yields turned negative for the first time since 2007 and could be a sign that the gap between two- and 10-year bonds will shortly follow, according to Mizuho International Plc.
“The curve inversion at the front end is confirming that the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle is closer than most have thought,” said Antoine Bouvet, an interest-rate strategist at Mizuho. “It is our expectation that 2s10s will follow and invert during the course of next year as investors turn bearish risky assets, but as the Fed continues hiking at a slower pace.”
U.S. 10-year yields fell two basis points to 2.95 percent by 9:32 a.m. in London, the lowest level since Sept. 13, while the dollar weakened against all Group-of-10 currencies. The yield spread between three- and five-year bonds was at minus one basis point.
The spread between two- and 10-year rates, which has narrowed to the flattest since 2007 at 14 basis points, is more closely watched as a potential indicator of pending recessions. Curve flattening over the past two years has signaled investors’ concern that rising rates against a backdrop of slowing global growth could harm the U.S. economy.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that borrowing costs are “just below” a range of estimates of the so-called neutral level, while Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan has said that the economy could look “very different” next year.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares traded in negative territory on Tuesday morning as investors started to question whether the truce agreed by the United States and China on their trade dispute would lead to a long-term deal. 
After enjoying a rally for its first day of trading in December, Germany’s DAX (GDAXI) – the most sensitive to China and trade war fears – was down 0.6 percent at 0906 GMT.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent. 
""The number one driver for global risk sentiment is the U.S.-China trade talks, which suddenly don't look as promising as they did over the weekend,"" wrote Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Christoph Rieger. 
The European automotive sector (SXAP), which is most sensitive to trade war fears, was the worst performing one, down 1.7 percent.
The tech sector (SXAP) was also a big loser, down 0.9 percent.
Chipmakers, which are also heavily exposed to China and trade sustained heavy losses with AMS (S:AMS) down 4.7 percent, Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) down 3.8 percent. 
Adding to the weak sentiment, the yield curve between U.S. three-year and five-year notes and between two-year and five-year inverted on Monday, a first since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt.
Analysts now fear an inversion of the two-year, 10-year yield curve could be imminent and point toward a possible U.S. recession.
""Recessionary fear is starting to raise its ugly head,"" wrote Stephen Innes at broker Oanda.
France's JCDecaux (PA:JCDX) posted one of the worst individual falls, down about 6 percent after Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) reinitiated its coverage of the stock with an ""underperform"" rating. 
French catering group  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) sank 7.3 percent after cutting its sales growth outlook, and Belgian postal services firm Bpost plunged 20 percent after a profit warning.
Energy stocks were among the few gainers as oil prices rose amid expected OPEC-led supply cuts and a mandated reduction in Canadian output.
 BP  (L:BP) rose 0.6 percent and Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) 0.5 percent. 
German industrial gases group Linde (DE:LINI) will replace British bank  Barclays  (L:BARC) on the leading index of pan-European stocks STOXX Europe 50 (STOXX50) STOXX Ltd, the operator of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) Group's index business, said.

The change comes as part of the quarterly reshuffle and will be effective at the opening of European trading on Dec. 24, STOXX said on Monday.

Infiniti said total volume set a November record of 22,126 vehicles. Of that, it sold 14,086 cars in the United States, up 8 percent on year, and 5,009 cars in China, a rise of 9 percent. 
That took its year-to-date volume to 207,188 vehicles, down 6 percent from the same period a year earlier. The brand attributed that decline to the slow pace of a production increase of its redesigned QX50 sport-utility vehicle.
""Now that two factories producing the new QX50 are up and running, we have a record November,"" a Hong Kong-based spokesman told Reuters, referring to locations in the U.S. and China.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 03:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lion Air ponders cancelling Boeing jets in row over crash - sources,"By Tim Hepher and Cindy Silviana
PARIS/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's Lion Air is reviewing airplane purchases from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and has not ruled out cancelling orders as relations worsen in a spat over responsibility for a 737 jetliner crash that killed 189 people in late October, sources told Reuters.
Group co-founder Rusdi Kirana is furious over what he sees as attempts by Boeing to deflect attention from recent design changes and blame Lion Air for the crash, while the airline faces scrutiny over its maintenance record and pilots' actions, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter.
Kirana is examining the possibility of cancelling remaining orders of Boeing jets ""from the next delivery"", according to one of the sources who is familiar with his thinking. Another source close to the airline said it was looking at cancelling orders. 
Kirana, a former group CEO who now serves as Indonesia's ambassador to Malaysia, remains closely involved with Lion Air and hosts a monthly meeting in Kuala Lumpur with the heads of the group's airlines based in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, according to the second person and an industry source.
No final decision been made by Lion Air, but discussion over the fate of $22 billion of remaining orders highlights the stakes surrounding an investigation involving Boeing's fastest-ever selling jet, the 737 MAX, which entered service last year.
Lion Air has 190 Boeing jets worth $22 billion at list prices waiting to be delivered, on top of 197 already taken, making it one of the largest U.S. export customers.
Any request to cancel could be designed to put pressure on Boeing and may require lengthy negotiations. Many airlines defer orders, but industry sources say aerospace suppliers rarely allow much scope for unilateral cancellations. 
Lion Air declined to comment. It was also not immediately clear how much of the airline is owned by Kirana.
A Boeing spokesman said: ""We are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this accident, and are working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved. We are also supporting our valued customer through this very tough time.""
MAINTENANCE, SOFTWARE
Kirana, who co-founded the airline with his brother in 2000, ordered the review of airline purchases in response to Boeing's statement last week focusing attention on piloting and maintenance topics, the person said.
Boeing released the statement focusing on maintenance actions spread over four flights in the run-up to the fatal flight on Oct. 29, after investigators issued an interim report that did not give a cause for the crash.
Boeing is also examining software changes in the wake of the crash, while insisting longstanding procedures exist for pilots to cancel automated nose-down movements experienced by the 737 MAX in response to erroneous sensor readings.
It has come under fire from U.S. pilots for not mentioning the MCAS system - a modification of existing anti-stall systems - in the manual for the 737 MAX, which began service last year.
""Why are they changing (software) if there was nothing wrong?"" the person familiar with Kirana's thinking said.
Boeing has said all information needed to fly the 737 safely is available to pilots and that its workhorse model is safe.
Bankers and some analysts say Lion Air and Southeast Asian rivals over-expanded and would be comfortable with fewer orders.
But the row highlights an unusually polarized dispute over the causes of the crash. Experts say most accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors and parties rarely comment in detail before the final report, which often follows a year of analysis.
In its statement, Boeing recapped the interim report and listed questions on maintenance and pilot behavior that it said remained unanswered in the 78-page document, but did not mention the MCAS modification covered in an earlier safety bulletin.
It is not the first time an airline has crossed swords with its supplier after a crash. 

Lion Air's rival AirAsia Group Bhd clashed with Airbus SE after its Indonesian subsidiary lost an A320 in 2014. It continued to take deliveries, but relations never fully recovered and it later toyed with buying 787s from Boeing.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 03:38AM ET</span>","Sharp contractors axe 3,000 staff as iPhone sensor output shifts: union","TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly 3,000 foreign workers subcontracted to Sharp Corp have been laid off in central Japan, a labor union said, as the firm moves production of some sensors for Apple iPhones to a Chinese plant owned by its parent Foxconn.
The labor union said some of the laid off workers were its members. The union is in Mie Prefecture in central Japan, where Sharp's plant is located.
The news of the relocation, first reported by the Nikkei business daily, and the layoffs sent Sharp shares down 5.7 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This compares to the broader Tokyo market's 2.4 percent decline.
The deep job cuts come as Japan debates whether to bring in more foreign workers amid a local labor shortage, highlighting how such employment is often at the mercy of manufacturers' production cycles.
A Sharp spokesman said the company was not in a position to comment on issues at subcontractors.
Sources familiar with the matter, however, told Reuters that Foxconn was relocating production of sensors used in the facial recognition feature introduced by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its iPhone X last year.
The sources, who declined to be identified because the decision to relocate is private, did not say why Taiwan's Foxconn decided to move the production from the Sharp plant to its own plant in China.
Foxconn said in a statement that the company follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products.
In October, Sharp lifted its full-year profit outlook as a part of a turnaround under the ownership of Foxconn.
The Osaka-based electronics maker has slashed costs after being taken over by Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, in 2016 as it struggles to compete with South Korean rivals in organic light-emitting diode screen technology.

Foxconn, Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, is conducting its own restructuring measures, aiming to cut 20 billion yuan ($2.88 billion) from expenses in 2019 as it faces ""a very difficult and competitive year"", Bloomberg has reported.

1364,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees Another Weak Year for Markets After a Lousy 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- Slowing economic growth, shrinking central bank balance sheets and continued bouts of volatility will help make 2019 another poor year for risk-adjusted investment returns, with few obvious havens, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“Expect better but still low returns in 2019” for multi-asset global allocation portfolios, Goldman strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissman wrote in a note Monday. While the decline in valuations across asset classes has improved the medium-term outlook, “we see a weaker expected macro backdrop in 2019 as likely to limit return potential,” they wrote.
The gloomy outlook matches the experience of what’s been a rough year for financial markets. Investors have been rattled by everything from monetary policy normalization to tariff threats to global trade, a slowdown in China and the prospect that corporate-earnings growth has peaked. In what some have called a regime change, bonds have also been poor hedges for equities, upending the classic 60-40 portfolio strategy.
For their part, the Goldman strategists still advise an overweight allocation to stocks, but recommend a bigger holding of cash than benchmarks suggest and have an underweight call on bonds. The team downgraded credit to underweight last week.
“We still see poor risk-adjusted returns in fixed income: we forecast negative total returns for bonds with more upward pressure on yields and credit spreads” in the first half of next year, they wrote. “There may be less reason to be bearish” on bonds by the latter part of 2019, as 10-year Treasuries “could reprice in the event of a more severe growth slowdown or deeper equity drawdown,” they said.
While far from catastrophic, this year is set to go down as one of the worst years for risk-adjusted cross-asset returns outside of crisis periods over the past quarter century, Goldman analysis indicates.
Though questions are emerging about the “strategic case” for commodities, Goldman has an overweight call on the asset class, with “significant near-term upside to oil” after the big tumble in crude the past two months. The team favors gold, with the dollar expected to weaken next year.
With the traditional bond hedge to equities unattractive, Goldman has also recommended that investors consider derivatives. With higher volatility, one tactic could involve selling calls on equities and buying puts after rallies, and buying calls and selling puts after “sharp corrections,” the strategists wrote separately last week.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 02:29AM ET</span>",Asia shares slump as trade truce doubts gather,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday as relief over a pause in escalation of the trade war between the U.S. and China gave way to doubt over the two countries' ability to resolve differences.
Adding to market worries, an inversion at the short end of the U.S. yield curve raised the specter of a possible U.S. recession.
The sell-off appeared likely to extend into European trading, with spreadbetters expecting London's FTSE 100 to fall 0.2 percent at the open, and both Frankfurt's DAX and Paris' CAC 40 to fall 0.4 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.3 percent lower.
Australia shares gave up 1 percent for the day and Seoul's Kospi ended 0.8 percent lower. 
Japan's Nikkei stock index tumbled, closing 2.4 percent lower on profit taking and as foreign investors and hedge funds reduced their positions on risky assets.
But Chinese blue-chip shares in Shenzhen and Shanghai added 0.2 percent after struggling to break into positive territory for much of the day.
The temporary freeze on further hostilities in the trade war between the United States and China had sparked a global rally in equity markets on Monday, pushing MSCI's all-country world index up 1.3 percent.
But even before the trading day ended, major U.S. indexes pulled back from intraday highs on scepticism that Washington and Beijing can resolve their deep-seated differences in the three-month negotiating window that was agreed, after which tariffs could escalate again.
""It seems that more details and signs of progress will be needed if the initial trade truce warm fuzzy feeling is to be sustained,"" National Australia Bank analysts said in a note to clients.
Already, there was confusion over when the 90-day period would start. A White House official said it started on Dec. 1, while earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters it would start on Jan. 1.
Moreover, none of the commitments that U.S. officials said had been given by China, including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos, were agreed to in writing and specifics had yet to be hammered out.
""The fear across global markets is that this is just a short term relief rally and we will find ourselves back where we were a few weeks ago and staring down the barrel of a long term global growth slow down,"" Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia said in a note.
Adding to worries over the outlook for the global economy, the yield curve between U.S. three-year and five-year notes, and between two-year and five-year paper inverted on Monday - the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt.
Analysts expect an inversion of the two-year, 10-year yield curve - seen as a predictor of a U.S. recession - to follow suit.
On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9515 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.991 percent on Monday.
The two-year yield also fell, but by a narrower margin, touching 2.8109 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.833 percent.
That put the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasuries around 14 basis points. Earlier in the day, the spread hits its narrowest level since July 2007.
""The market pricing evident in the yield curve inversion from three to five segment of the curve, as well as the dip in the 10-year yield below 3 percent yesterday, goes to reinforce these concerns"" about the U.S. economy potentially heading into a recession, said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING in Singapore. 
However, he added that solid U.S. manufacturing data released Monday pointed to a stronger economic outlook, with new orders a ""key driver"" in boosting activity.

In contrast to faltering Asian equity markets, oil prices continued to rise after surging 4 percent the day before on the U.S.-China trade truce, and ahead of a key OPEC meeting expected to lead to supply cuts.
U.S. crude was 1 percent higher at $53.46 per barrel, and Brent crude futures gained 0.9 percent to $62.26 a barrel.
SOFTER DOLLAR
In the currency market, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peers, softened 0.3 percent to 96.718.
The dollar was 0.5 percent weaker against the yen, at 113.047, and the euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.1384.
As the dollar weakened, China's yuan continued to surge, and was trading at 6.8419 to the dollar around 0700 GMT. Since Friday, it has added more than 1,000 pips against the greenback.
""The gain in the yuan is no surprise given the ceasefire and the yuan's weakness over the course of this year as the trade tensions escalated,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group in Singapore.
Goh said that comments from U.S. Trade Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the yuan had been discussed during dinner between the Chinese and U.S. presidents ""suggests that perhaps there is an intention for the Chinese side to ensure that the currency doesn't weaken further,"" providing a further boost to the yuan.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee, but the hearing was postponed because of a national day of mourning for U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Friday.
The dollar came under pressure last week on Powell's comments that rates were nearing neutral levels, which markets widely interpreted as signaling a slowdown in the Fed's rate-hike cycle. 

Spot gold jumped on the weaker dollar, trading up 0.5 percent at $1,237.24 per ounce. [GOL/]

1370,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 10:57PM ET</span>","Asian Markets Mixed After China, U.S. Agree to Pause Trade War","Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed in morning trade on Tuesday after the U.S. and China declared a truce in their trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping promised to halt the introduction of new tariffs for 90 days, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
The White House also called the meeting “highly successful”, adding that the U.S. would leave existing tariffs on Chinese imports at 10% and refrain from increasing the rates as previously planned on Jan. 1.
However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that the U.S. would raise those tariffs to 25% if no progress on structural reform from China were made after 90 days.
Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday in a briefing on trade talks that the two countries are “pretty close on some agreements on IP theft, pretty close to some agreements on the forced transfer of technology from American companies.”
“When I say pretty close, they are kind of on the front burner, hot list that we’ve developed with them,” said Kudlow.
He then added that he expects China would reduce tariffs on autos imported from the U.S. to “zero.” Beijing currently imposes a 15% tariff on imported vehicles and raised the levy on U.S. cars to 40% in retaliation for tariffs the Trump administration imposed on Chinese products.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite traded 0.04% higher to 2,656.0, while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2%.
Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China, said in an interview with the state-owned China Finance magazine that the central bank would keep its monetary policy flexible, but tools he described as a ""slow release of air"" and ""soft landing"" must be used when the economy begins overheating.
The central bank would also promote the opening up of China’s financial industry to technology to enhance international confidence in the yuan, said Yi. 
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.3%. Sharp Corp (T:6753)’s share prices plunged more than 4% in morning trade following reports that the company has laid off more than 3,000 foreign workers in Japan.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 10:45PM ET</span>",China Development Bank to finance eight Airbus aircraft purchases for HNA,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The aviation leasing arm of China Development Bank said it will finance eight Airbus (PA:AIR) A330 purchases for airlines affiliated to debt-laden HNA Group and that the jets will be delivered by the end of 2018.
Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) and Lucky Air Co have agreed to assign the right to purchase and take delivery of the eight new Airbus A330–300 aircraft to China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co, the financier said in a corporate filing.
It added that this was in accordance with the original purchase contract between the airlines and Airbus.
The European planemaker had suspended deliveries to HNA-affiliated companies after they delayed payments earlier this year. According to sources, deliveries of over a dozen planes have been hit by HNA-related funding shortages.
Reuters reported last week that China Development Bank (CDB), HNA's biggest creditor, was expected to be involved in financing deliveries of up to 8 of the planes.
Airbus declined to comment on Tuesday whether these were the eight planes that CDB's aviation leasing arm had agreed to finance, saying that talks and contractual terms with customers are confidential, but added that deliveries were ongoing. 
HNA did not immediately respond to Reuters questions. 
The Chinese aviation-to-finance conglomerate has attracted much scrutiny for its $50 billion worth of deals in recent years that included hotels in the United States and left it the largest shareholder in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

Faced with soaring debts and China's crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, HNA has been pushing ahead with a series of asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotel groups, but has said that it will hold onto its core airline business.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) briefly became the most valuable company on Wall Street in intraday trade on Monday, days after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) dethroned long-time leader Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Amazon rose by 4.7 percent at one point, putting its market capitalization at $865.0 billion. At the same time, Apple traded up 2.1 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $864.8 billion.
Microsoft, which on Friday closed above Apple's market capitalization for the first time in eight years, was up 0.9 percent, leaving its stock market value at $859.0 billion, third in the group.
Amazon's lead lasted only a few seconds. At the close, Apple was back on top with a 3.49 percent increase in its stock that put its total value at $877 billion. It was followed by Amazon, up 4.86 percent with a market capitalization of $866.6 billion, and then Microsoft, up 1.08 percent and a stock market value of $860.4 billion.
The tight race between the trio of high-powered technology stocks coincided with a broad stock market rally after the United States and China agreed on a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute. 
Apple in August became the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, but its share price has fallen sharply in recent months as investors worried that demand for iPhones was losing steam.
Its market capitalization overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.
Amazon's stock has recovered most of the ground it lost after the online retailer in October forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter. 
Although it is down about 13 percent from its Sept. 4 record-high close, in the year to date Amazon's stock is up 51 percent, compared with a 31 percent rise for Microsoft and Apple's 9 percent increase.

A Cade report prepared to inform a subsequent ruling by the regulator said the deal would result in ""a significant increase in concentration in the market of sports channels on cable TV and a high probability that Disney could control the market.""
This could ""potentially reduce the quality and diversity of the sports content available, besides raising costs that could be passed on to consumers,"" the report said.
It recommended remedial measures. Cade has until March 23, 2019 to decide and the deadline can be extended for 90 days.
""The filing of the report on CADE's review of the 21st Century Fox acquisition is part of the agency's normal pre-merger process,"" a Disney spokesman said. ""We have been and are continuing to work productively with the agency to address any concerns.""

Disney agreed to purchase Fox's film and television assets for $71.3 billion and has received approval from China and the European Commission earlier this month, subject to certain conditions.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. LNG developers see possible opening from U.S.-China trade truce,"By Scott DiSavino
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies proposing new U.S. liquefied natural gas export terminals expressed optimism on Monday the agreement between the United States and China temporarily halting the imposition of higher tariffs could help advance their projects.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Saturday to a 90-day freeze on new tariffs to advance trade talks, declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions.
The decision ""is a positive sign that the development of U.S. LNG projects will not be detoured in the immediate term by any further trade conflicts,"" said Micah Hirschfield, spokesman for  Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd  (AX:LNG), one of more than a dozen companies proposing new U.S.-based LNG export terminals.
The United States is the world's fastest-growing exporter of LNG and China is the fastest-growing importer of the fuel. China bought about 15 percent of U.S. LNG exports in 2017, worth about $447 million. So far in 2018, China was on track to buy just 10 percent of U.S. LNG shipments.
Any cooling off of the trade war would help projects like LNG Ltd's Magnolia project move to ""execute long-term LNG export contracts with offtakers from China without punitive external factors,"" Hirschfield said.
Alaska Gasline Development Corp, which expects in 2020 to make a final investment decision to build its $43 billion Alaska LNG project, was ""gratified that trade talks appear to be progressing,"" said spokesman Jesse Carlstrom. 
The company has continued negotiations with customers in China and elsewhere in Asia despite trade frictions, he said. 
Some LNG executives and analysts said, however, that advancing more LNG terminal proposals to construction would require a more formal agreement conducive to signing long-term sales contracts. 
""The market needs something more concrete than a 90-day reprieve of hostilities to confidently commit time and capital for projects that take several years to bring online,"" said Matt Hong, director of research, power and gas at Morningstar
Inc. 
While a pledge by China to increase purchases of U.S. energy products may lead to a short-term sales boost, the need for long-term purchase commitments has not gone away. 
""The reality of the situation is that not much has changed as far as the LNG sector is concerned,"" said Abhishek Kumar, a senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics.

""Investors are now looking for a tangible progress in trade talks and not just political gestures,"" Kumar said.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>","Senators, union press GM CEO on plant closings, job cuts","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra, facing growing criticism, will meet with Ohio's two U.S. senators on Wednesday about the Detroit automaker's plans to idle five North American plants and cut up to 15,000 jobs.
Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, and Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, said in a joint statement they will ""press"" GM to save the Lordstown, Ohio, plant in the northeast part of the state. 
The announcement came as the United Auto Workers union on Monday sent a letter to GM formally objecting to the decision to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during contract talks in 2015. The decision to close an assembly plant in Ohio has come under fire from President Donald Trump and others.
In the letter seen by Reuters, the UAW asked GM to rescind the decision and resolve the fate of the plants during negotiations next year. Calling the plants ""unallocated"" does not relieve GM ""of its obligation to comply"" with a moratorium on plant closings, the UAW letter said. ""We will use all of our resources to enforce our agreements,"" the letter said.
GM did not immediately comment.
Since early 2017, GM has cut two of the three production shifts at the Ohio plant that makes the Chevrolet Cruze car, eliminating 3,000 jobs. GM has said it is closing the plants due to sagging demand for cars.
In addition to the plant closings, GM is cutting about 8,000 salaried jobs in North America on top of the 2,250 salaried workers who volunteered to take buyouts.
Barra has additional meetings planned with lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday from states that are impacted and some congressional leaders, congressional aides said. At least one Democrat, Tim Ryan of Ohio, has called for congressional hearings on GM's decision next year.
Maryland's two senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and four other members of Congress from the state wrote Barra on Friday asking her for a meeting about the company's plans to close a facility near Baltimore that received more than $100 million in federal subsidies.

""Closing a productive plant when GM has accepted significant public assistance and has reported healthy third-quarter profits of $2.5 billion is an example of extremely poor corporate citizenship,"" the lawmakers wrote.

1376,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Yield Curve Inversion Sending Bearish Signals?
The economic data calendar is pretty empty tomorrow, but there will be plenty of chatter about interest rates after part of the yield curve inverted today.
A yield curve inversion is when the shorter-dated bond yields rise above the longer-term yields.
When this happens with Treasuries, many see it as a sign of an approaching recession, with traders betting that rates will be lower due to economic weakness down the line.
The yield on the 5-year Treasury fell below the yield of the 3-year Treasury today, something that hasn’t happened since 2007.
The 3-Year yield stood at 2.841% at the time of writing, with the 5-Year at 2.831%. The spread between the 2-year and the 10-year was also at an 11-year low.



2. AutoZone, Dollar General Set to Report Earnings
Retail earnings are still trickling in, with AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) reporting before the bell tomorrow.
Shares are higher over the last three months, with the auto parts retailer recovering from a hit it took in mid-October when rival  Advance Auto Parts  (NYSE:AAP) said it was teaming up with Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
On average, analysts a predicting a profit of $12.21 per share on sales of $2.6 billion.
Dollar General (NYSE:DG) will also weigh in, looking to repeat the solid performance of competitor Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) recently.
The Wall Street forecast is for $1.27 a share on sales of about $6.4 billion.
3. Can Oil Continue Its Rally?
The oil market promises to be active again as traders continue to analyze how U.S. and China trade negotiations will impact demand and the possibility of supply cuts from OPEC and Russia.
Oil prices jumped today, helped by Canada surprising the market with a commitment to reduce output with crude prices struggling.
OPEC will meet in Vienna on Thursday, with Russia also expected to be in the discussion. Also that day, the latest U.S. oil inventories numbers will released, a day later than usual with the federal government closed on Wednesday in honor of the late President George H.W. Bush.
""Admittedly, the outcome of the OPEC meeting in Vienna is not a given,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. ""Non-core OPEC members (Iraq/Iran) are likely to ask that the burden of the cut be footed by the countries that have most aggressively ramped-up (Saudi/UAE/Kuwait). Further, we don’t expect Russia to offer more than a token reduction from current production levels."""
1377,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Soars as Tech Triumphs on Trade War Truce ,"Investing.com - The Dow rallied Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade war truce, prompting a wave of buying on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.13%. The S&P 500 added 1.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51%.
Chip stocks, which have been weighed down by the months-long U.S.-Sino standoff, given their large exposure to China, helped lift tech stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose more than 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 11%.
The truce eased the threat of tariffs on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), sending the iPhone maker's shares more than 3% higher, adding further steel to the rally in tech. The Wall Street Journal raised fears last week that Apple could face trade headwinds after reporting that Trump suggested he could introduce a 10% tariff on iPhones and laptops imported from China.
The de-escalation in trade tensions was met with skepticism from some on Wall Street who suggested the truce failed to resolve the most important structural trade issues between the two countries.
Goldman Sachs said that while the result showed ""the willingness of the two sides to reach a deal,"" finding a ""mutually agreeable compromise"" that would lead to a comprehensive rollback of tariffs ""will be challenging.""
Still trade-sensitive sectors were bid as industrials gained, led by a rise in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), trade bellwethers given their large international exposure.
Autos were also in favor after China said late Sunday it would reduce and remove its 40% tariff on cars coming into China from the United States. While it is not yet clear to what level the tariff on imported U.S. cars would fall, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) ended the day higher.
Fiat Chrysler was also bolstered by data showing November sales topped expectations.
Energy stocks surged, meanwhile, as oil prices rose 4% after Canada's Alberta province pledged to cut 325,000 barrels per day to tackle a build-up in supplies owing to a pipeline bottleneck.
In corporate news, casino stocks rallied after Macau gaming revenue growth was higher-than-expected in November. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) ended the day sharply higher.
On the economic front, ISM manufacturing data for November topped economists expectations, while construction spending data fell short.

Under the new agreement https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000100103918000210/0001001039-18-000210-index.htm, Iger will earn no shares if the company's relative total shareholder return is less than or equal to 25 percentile of the total shareholder return of companies in the S&P 500 index.
""In line with the Disney Board's pay-for-performance philosophy, the amendments to Mr. Iger's contract establish more rigorous performance requirements for his equity award than those reflected in the original contract,"" a spokesperson of Walt Disney said. 
Under the previous compensation package, Iger was being paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses following the Fox deal closure for each of the four years from 2018-2021.
The amended deal could help Disney assuage investor concerns over pay to Iger, who stood to earn up to $423 million over four years and faced concerns his performance targets were too low. 

At last spring's shareholder meeting the company suffered a rare rebuke when a majority opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote, a very rare result for a U.S. company.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes rallied on Monday following a trade truce between the United States and China, whose tensions have clouded the outlook for the stock market for much of the year.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) gained nearly 1 percent, building off of its biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly seven years a week ago, although the index had come off its earlier session highs in afternoon trading.
Investors were lifted by news over the weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on new tariffs during talks in Argentina, declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions on trade and other issues.
“Today is mostly about celebrating the fact that the U.S. and China have delayed what could have been the some of the worst-case scenarios regarding their trade relations,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Still, Arone noted that ""there are still some very sticky issues that need to be resolved"" between the world's two biggest economies.
""We still have a long way to go to have what is an agreed-upon trading relationship between the U.S. and China, so I think that is a little bit of the pullback from the highs of the day as that settles in with investors,"" Arone said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 232.91 points, or 0.91 percent, to 25,771.37, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 23.68 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,783.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 86.92 points, or 1.19 percent, to 7,417.46.
Last week, the S&P 500 gained 4.8 percent, rebounding after confirming its second 10 percent correction of the year, as investors interpreted commentary from the Federal Reserve as signaling that U.S. interest rate hikes may be less aggressive than feared.
On Monday, the technology sector (SPLRCT), among the groups seen as sensitive to trade tensions, gained 1.7 percent. Apple (O:AAPL) shares, recently hit by worries over possible tariffs on iPhones, gained 2.3 percent.
Shares of Boeing (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), two industrial companies viewed as trade bellwethers, gained 3.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, and gave a lift to the blue-chip Dow. The industrial sector (SPLRCI) rose 1.2 percent.
Energy shares (SPNY) rose 2.0 percent as oil prices bounced back from their recent swoon. Along with the U.S.-China trade detente, oil got support as Canada's Alberta province ordered a production cut, while exporter group OPEC looked set to reduce supply.
In corporate news, shares of Tesaro (O:TSRO) soared 58.7 percent after GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) agreed to buy the U.S. cancer specialist for $5.1 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 03:08PM ET</span>",U.S. top court signals it will buttress anti-fraud securities laws,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared reluctant to further limit the scope of who can be held liable for violating laws that protect investors from securities fraud as they weighed an appeal by a New York investment banker who had been banned from the industry.
Only eight of the nine justices were present to hear arguments over a ruling by a Washington-based federal appeals court that found Francis Lorenzo liable for participating in a scheme to defraud investors when he sent misleading emails about a financially-troubled clean energy company. 
Most of the justices seemed to agree with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had enforced the securities laws against Lorenzo, while Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, seemed sympathetic to him. 
The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, did not participate in the case because he was part of the three-judge appeals court panel that previously reviewed the dispute. Kavanaugh joined the high court in October. 
Kavanaugh dissented in the appeals court ruling that upheld most of the SEC's liability findings against Lorenzo, and would have sided with the banker.
The high court must rule in the case by the end of June. 
The dispute centers on whether a person who did not personally make fraudulent statements but merely passed them along can be found liable for engaging in a fraudulent scheme. Anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws prohibit false statements and other conduct categorized as acts, devices, practices or schemes. 
On Monday, all four liberal justices and conservative Justice Samuel Alito appeared to approve of Lorenzo's liability in the deceptive scheme. 
Lorenzo's attorney Robert Heim said that sending emails was not inherently deceptive, but liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the emails contained a ""succession of untruths."" Justice Stephen Breyer said, ""Maybe he didn't make the statement, but he was sure a big deal participant."" 
Alito wondered why Lorenzo's actions would not ""fall squarely"" within the language of the SEC's rules. 
In 2011 the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of who can be liable for false statements to those with ultimate authority over the statements. 
Lorenzo, who served as the investment banking director at a broker-dealer called Charles Vista, sent the emails in 2009 seeking investors for a startup company's debt offering even though its energy-from-waste technology did not work. 
The SEC in 2015 found that he made false statements and participated in a deceptive scheme by sending the emails. The commission fined him $15,000 and barred him from working in the industry for life. 
Citing the 2011 Supreme Court precedent, the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out Lorenzo's liability over the false statements, saying they were made by his boss, but agreed with the fraudulent scheme charges because he knowingly produced and sent the false statements in the emails. It ordered the SEC to reconsider the penalties against Lorenzo. 
Lorenzo said the SEC is trying to paint people who might be liable at most for aiding and abetting fraudulent schemes as the primary violators of securities laws. 
On Monday, Gorsuch seemed to agree, noting that Lorenzo did not make the false statements in the emails he sent. 

Lorenzo, who had the support of the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, said that if the appeals court is not overturned it will lead to a swarm of abusive lawsuits, harming financial markets and the economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge who has been asked to sign off on the government's decision to approve CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) acquisition of insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) indicated on Monday he may ask the companies to halt integration pending his decision.
Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia complained at a hearing last week that the two sides had treated him as a ""rubber stamp"" for the deal. CVS closed the $69 billion transaction last week and began the integration process.
Leon said at a hearing on Monday that he would issue an order asking the two sides to argue why he should not require CVS and Aetna to be held separate until he decides whether he will approve the consent agreement reached in October between the companies and the U.S. Justice Department.
Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, declined comment after the hearing.
A CVS spokesman said in an email after the hearing: ""CVS Health and Aetna are one company, and our focus is on transforming the consumer health experience.""
Leon said during the brief hearing that he was ""concerned"" the Justice Department's filing with the court pointed to antitrust issues. In October, the Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna on condition that the health insurer sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (N:WCG). 
Most deals struck between the government and companies to resolve antitrust concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreement is in the public interest.

Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 02:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ace Hardware, Centerbridge eye Sears' home services unit: sources","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Retailer Ace Hardware Corp [ACEHW.UL] and investment firm Centerbridge Partners LP are together eyeing an offer for bankrupt Sears Holdings Corp's (PK:SHLD) home services division that would compete with an expected bid from Chairman Eddie Lampert, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Wednesday is the deadline for initial offers in a bankruptcy auction for the home services business, the largest U.S. appliance repair provider, and other Sears assets, according to a November letter from the company's bankers to prospective bidders. The group eyeing the home services division has studied a possible bid for weeks, though there is no guarantee an offer will materialize, the sources said.
Sears is also negotiating with Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, on a potential deal to acquire stores and businesses that would aim to keep the 125-year-old retailer operating as a going concern, according to court papers and people familiar with the discussions. 
The sources did not give a value for a potential offer from Centerbridge and Ace, which has more than 5,000 stores globally. Earlier this year, ESL offered to buy parts of the home services division with a collective enterprise value of $500 million. 
A Sears spokesman declined to comment. An Ace representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a Centerbridge spokesman declined to comment.
Lampert, who stepped down as chief executive officer when Sears filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 15, is the company's largest creditor and shareholder. ESL's takeover bid for Sears is initially expected to eclipse $2 billion, an amount that would repay senior lenders, said people familiar with the matter. 
ESL also plans to forgive some Sears debt it holds in exchange for acquiring assets to finance its offer, a bankruptcy maneuver known as credit bidding, these sources said.
The sources cautioned that the exact structure and value of the ESL bid could change as Sears repays creditors. An ESL spokesman declined to comment on specific details of the hedge fund's offer. 
Sears is also fielding offers for separate pieces of the department-store chain as well as bids from liquidators that would shut down the company, according to the November letter from the company's bankers.
While Sears prefers selling most assets together, it may sell pieces to different buyers, further breaking apart what was once the world's largest retailer.
Sears faces calls from some creditors, including landlords and bondholders, to wind down its business because they expect to collect more on their debts if the retailer liquidates, according to bankruptcy-court papers. The company has argued it has a plan to remain operating and preserve tens of thousands of jobs. 
Sears faces a Dec. 15 deadline to find a bid that keeps it in business, according to court papers. 

That deal can then be topped by other suitors in a court-supervised auction. Definitive bids are due Dec. 28, according to court papers.

PARIS (Reuters) - Three weeks of ""yellow vest"" protests have hit the French economy hard, with trade in shops, hotels and restaurants falling significantly, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday.
Speaking after a meeting with industry groups and business federations affected by the protest movement, Le Maire said sector revenues had been hit by between 15 and 50 percent.
While not providing a precise breakdown, Le Maire said small retailers had seen a fall in revenue of between 20 and 40 percent, and the hotel industry was seeing reservations down 15 to 25 percent.
Restaurants, depending on their location, had seen takings collapse by between 20 and 50 percent.
""The impact is severe and ongoing,"" Le Maire said, emphasizing it was nationwide, although Paris, after riots and looting in some of its most upmarket districts on Saturday afternoon and evening, was particularly affected.
The movement began on Nov. 17 as a social-media-planned protest against fuel-tax rises, but has since morphed into an anti-Macron uprising.
The ministry was not able to say what sort of impact the unrest would have on gross domestic product, but having hoped for a pick-up in the fourth quarter on the back of rising consumer spending, that now appears less likely.
Holiday season shopping has started poorly, according to industry group Federation du Commerce et de la Distribution, which expects a slump in hirings and a transfer of shopping to e-commerce, mainly on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a spokeswoman said.
Amazon was not immediately available to comment but CDiscount, the e-commerce arm of retailer Casino, attributed the record number of visits to its websites partly to ""demonstrations or blockades organized outside some shops"".
Market data aggregator Nielsen said on Monday retail sales had contracted during three days of nationwide protest since Nov. 17, and had struggled to recover in between. It said supermarket sales had plunged 35 percent on day one on Nov. 17 and 18 percent on day two, Nov. 24.
Last week, sales were down six to 13 percent Monday through Wednesday, picked up slightly on Thursday and Friday, but then fell eight percent again on the third day of nationwide protests on Saturday, it said. 
During Saturday's disturbances in Paris, tourists were left shocked, with some saying they would cut short their visit.
MANY SECTORS AFFECTED
When they started, the ""yellow vests"" protests were focused on denouncing a squeeze on household spending brought about by President Emmanuel Macron's taxes on diesel, which he says are necessary to combat climate change and protect the environment.
But for the past two weekends there have also been violent demonstrations and clashes with security forces in Paris and other major cities, with protesters calling for Macron to resign. Some call it a revolution against a president who they see as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.
Saturday's protests in Paris turned particularly violent, with protesters from the far-right and far-left mixing with the ""yellow vests"" and intent on causing as much damage as possible.
The Arc de Triomphe was defaced and avenues off Paris's Champs Elysees were the scene of mass-vandalism.
Shops on the Champs Elysees and in the heart of Paris, including the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and Dior and Chanel boutiques, had their windows smashed. Some others were looted. Prestigious Parisian department stores Printemps and Galeries Lafayette protectively shut their doors on Saturday afternoon.
Luxury groups such as SMCP, Hermes and LVMH, which are heavily dependent on foreign tourists visiting Paris during the Christmas season are likely to suffer, said Berenberg analysts in a report.
The effect may extend through the holiday season.
Hotel industry group UMIH said some Paris hotels were seeing cancellation rates of 20 percent to 50 percent and reservations down 10 percent to 15 percent.
""We have received calls from many worried customers and we have reassured them,"" said Carlos Conesa, head concierge at the five-star Napoleon Hotel. ""During the protests, the hotel didn't suffer any damage and most of our guests decided to stay inside and had dinner in our restaurants.""
While the violence in downtown Paris stunned the country, waves of protests have also targeted road infrastructure, with a another potential impact on the economy.
Vinci Autoroute, France's largest toll-road operator, has seen dozens of road blockades and forced openings of barriers since the protests erupted two weeks ago. Protesters have also damaged infrastructure, a spokesman said.
French oil major Total has said 75 of its 2,200 petrol stations have run dry as ""yellow vests"" blockade fuel depots. 
Car manufacturer  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) said production at a plant in eastern France was disrupted for half a day. It takes almost two weeks to recover disrupted output, it said.

Le Maire said both Peugeot and rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) had lost vehicle orders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator believes that banks should be increasingly aware of activity in the leveraged lending market, cautioning rapid growth in that sector by nonbanks could pose future risks to the financial sector.
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) highlighted loans to highly-indebted companies in its semiannual risk report issued on Monday.
While lending by banks in that sector does not seem exceedingly risky, the OCC cautioned near-record issuance in that sector, driven by nonbanks like private equity firms and hedge funds, merits closer attention.
""The banks, generally, we feel comfortable with their underwriting and how they're performing within the leveraged lending market. But it is clearly something for us all to keep an eye on,"" U.S. Comptroller Joseph Otting said on a call with reporters.
Leveraged lending has attracted some attention in Washington of late. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed regulators earlier this month about underwriting standards in that market.
The Federal Reserve is also hearing more from concerned parties about the leveraged loan market and how it could complicate future economic downturns.
Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, earlier on Monday said the U.S. central bank is studying banks' exposure to leveraged debt. 
Speaking in New York, he noted that banks do not hold most leveraged loans or collateralized loan obligations on their books, but the matter and potential risks they present are being analyzed.
The average leverage for large corporate loans is at a record high, the OCC noted in its report, adding that banks can sometimes be indirectly exposed to riskier lending in the space through investments in debt funds or private equity funds.
Overall, the OCC found credit quality on bank loans to be generally strong, but noted that credit risk is building. Growing competition for new loans, particularly from nonbanks, is pushing banks to consider riskier lending, the regulator warned.
The OCC also identified cybersecurity as a key operational risk for banks. Otting called it a ""critical risk"" that if not properly managed could pose a fundamental threat to financial institutions. 
The regulator noted that banks rely on third-party providers for a range of services, which can pose their own risks if not properly monitored.

""Cybercrime and espionage increasingly target third-party service providers to gain access to bank information or systems,"" the OCC warned.

Following the 90-day trade-war truce agreed between President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping on Saturday, China said late Sunday it would reduce and remove its 40% tariff on cars coming into China from the United States.
While it was not clear to what level the tariff on imported U.S. cars would fall, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business on Monday he assumes the tariffs would be rolled back all the way.
Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) said November sales increased 17% from a year ago to 181,310 vehicles, beating Wall Street estimates for a 15% increase, sending its shares more than 4% higher.
The upbeat performance was driven by 12% rise in the Jeep brand to 73,784 vehicles, with Wrangler, Cherokee and Compass models all reaching sales records for the month.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) rose 3%, shrugging off data showing its sales fell about 6.9% to 196,303 vehicles in November, pressured by 2.3% drop in truck sales, a 4.9% decline in SUVs and a 19.5% tumble in cars.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has made more than $1.2 trillion in additional trade commitments as part of a deal reached by U.S. President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping and Beijing has vowed to take immediate steps on those promises.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on new tariffs during talks in Argentina on Saturday, declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions on trade and other issues. 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Monday there was a clear shift in tone at Buenos Aires from past discussions with Chinese officials, as Xi offered a clear commitment to open China's markets to U.S. companies.
""They put on the table an offer of over $1.2 trillion in additional commitments. But the details of that still need to be negotiated,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""This is the first time that we have a commitment from them that this will be a real agreement.""
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said he, Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had lunch with China's vice premier in Argentina and he told them that Beijing would move immediately on the new commitments.
""The history here with China promises is not very good. And we know that,"" Kudlow said. ""However, I will say this: President Xi has never been this involved.
""They cannot slow walk this, stall this, meander this. Their word: ‘immediately.’""
Kudlow told reporters at the White House that Washington would like to see progress quickly on structural issues, including intellectual property theft and technology transfers. Americans will get majority ownership in companies in China for the first time, which should help address those issues, he said on CNBC.
The United States agreed not to raise tariffs further on Jan. 1, while China agreed to buy more agricultural products from U.S. farmers immediately.
The two sides also agreed to negotiate over the next 90 days to resolve issues of concern raised by the United States including intellectual property protection, non-tariff trade barriers and cyber theft.
The truce boosted global markets on Monday with world stocks up nearly 1 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.94 percent at the open and the S&P 500 by 1.10 percent. 
U.S. officials will monitor Chinese progress on enforcing the commitments very closely, Kudlow said.
Trump has appointed Lighthizer, one of the administration's most vocal China critics, to oversee the new round of trade talks with China, a White House official and a U.S. official told Reuters on Monday.
The appointment of Lighthizer may signify a harder line in talks with Beijing and marks a shift from past practices where Mnuchin had a lead role.
Lighthizer is an experienced trade negotiator who just completed a new agreement with Canada and Mexico.
""He's the toughest negotiator we've ever at the USTR and he's going to go chapter and verse and get tariffs down, non-tariff barriers down and end all these structural practices that prevent market access,"" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told National Public Radio earlier on Monday.
The White House is stepping up efforts to prod other countries to build more vehicles in the United States. Lighthizer and other officials including National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow are set to meet with German automakers on Tuesday, including the chief executives at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), people briefed on the matter said.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import levies on American-made cars.

Chinese regulators did not respond to requests for comment on Trump's tweet on autos tariffs. Neither country had mentioned auto tariffs in their official read-outs of the Trump-Xi meeting.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>",Shell to set sector-leading emissions targets after investor pressure,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) caved in to growing investor pressure over climate change on Monday, setting out plans to introduce industry-leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay.
Rivals  BP  (LON:BP) and Total have already set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but these are limited to their own operations. 
Shell's targets, which will be introduced in 2020, will be more extensive with inclusion of the so-called Scope 3 emissions from the burning of fuels sold to millions of customers around the world, the company said. 
Monday's move marks a change of tack for Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, who had previously resisted setting hard goals, saying it would be ""foolhardy"" to expose Shell to legal challenges.
Shareholders have criticized Shell for previously setting long-term ""ambitions"" to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, which lacked binding targets for implementation.
But after discussions with investors, the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas giant said that from 2020 it will set three-year or five-year targets every year.
Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Shell investor Legal and General, said: ""It is a very strong message from the world's second-largest oil company. As investors, we will go to other companies about what they can do. Shell are showing that it is hard but doable.""
Shell, which did not specify any targets on Monday, plans to link targets and other measures to its executive remuneration policy. The revised policy will be put to shareholders for approval at its annual meeting in 2020.
The company has already linked 10 percent of executives' remuneration to reducing carbon emissions from the company's operations. The new targets will include Scope 3 emissions, a Shell spokeswoman said.
""We are taking important steps towards turning our Net Carbon Footprint ambition into reality by setting shorter-term targets,"" CEO Van Beurden said in a statement. 
The move comes as governments meet in Poland for a United Nations-hosted conference to lay out a ""rule book"" to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord that set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help to limit global warming.

(Reuters) - Nexstar Media Group Inc (O:NXST) said on Monday it agreed to buy Chicago-based peer Tribune Media Company (N:TRCO) for about $4.1 billion in cash, making it the largest regional U.S. TV station operator.
Nexstar said it would pay $46.50 per share, representing a premium of 15.5 percent to Tribune Media's closing price on Friday. Tribune shares rose 10 percent and Nexstar shares 3 percent in midday trading.
The value of the deal was in line with what Reuters reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Including debt, the deal is worth $6.4 billion. 
The acquisition comes just three months after Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc's (O:SBGI) $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune collapsed over regulatory hurdles. 
However, since then the broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks, amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. 
Irving, Texas-based Nexstar said the transaction was subject to approvals by Tribune's shareholders and regulators including the FCC. The company intends to divest certain television stations necessary to comply with regulatory ownership limits.
Nexstar owns, operates and provides sales and other services to 174 television stations reaching nearly 39 percent of all U.S. television households, while Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households.
Nexstar outbid private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) with an all-cash offer that values Tribune at around $46.50 per share, three sources had told Reuters.
The deal, expected to close late in the third quarter of 2019, will add about $160 million in the first year to Nexstar's earnings, the companies said.
""The transaction will result in approximately 46 percent growth in Nexstar's average annual free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle to approximately $900 million,"" Nexstar's chief executive officer Perry Sook said in a statement. 
Nexstar said it had received committed financing for the transaction from BofA Merrill Lynch,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""We think this is a great acquisition for Nexstar that would position them to be the dominant player in the space...the transaction is massively FCF accretive and the synergy numbers are likely to prove conservative,"" said Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos.
BofA Merrill Lynch is serving as the financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Wiley Rein LLP as legal counsel to Nexstar.

Moelis & Co and Guggenheim Securities are financial advisers to Tribune Media and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and Covington & Burling LLP are its legal counsel.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",GSK slides after buying cancer firm Tesaro for hefty $5.1 billion,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has agreed to buy U.S. cancer specialist Tesaro for $5.1 billion, a costly investment to rebuild the pharmaceuticals business by new Chief Executive Emma Walmsley that unnerved investors.
GSK has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rival drugmakers under previous CEO Andrew Witty. That is a situation Walmsley wants to change.
Britain's biggest drugmaker is paying $75 a share for Tesaro, an 110 percent premium to the 30-day average price. It is also taking on Tesaro's debt. 
News of the lofty valuation and the fact that buying Tesaro will take years to pay off sent GSK shares down 8 percent on Monday, their biggest daily fall in 10 years.
Boston-based Tesaro has long been seen as a potential takeover target, with other suggested acquirers in the past including Switzerland's Roche.
The definitive agreement to acquire Tesaro, which means GSK has to pay $162.5 million if the tie-up is terminated, comes on the same day as GSK sold its India-focused Horlicks nutrition business to  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) for $3.8 billion, freeing up cash.
Tesaro gives GSK a marketed product for ovarian cancer, Zejula, which belongs to a promising class of medicines called poly ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. 
But Zejula lags behind AstraZeneca and Merck & Co's rival PARP drug Lynparza, which sells nearly three times more, while Clovis Oncology also has a competitor called Rubraca.
PARP inhibitors work by blocking enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA, thereby helping to kill cancer cells, and they are a growing focus for drug research, with potential for use beyond ovarian tumors in breast, lung and prostate cancers.
For GSK, making Zejula work in wider population groups will be critical in justifying the high price it is paying.
Walmsley, who took over in April 2017, has made replenishing GSK's medicines cabinet her top priority. She recently hired a business development executive from Roche's Genentech, another signal of her readiness to make acquisitions.
""This is an example of us executing on what we said we were going to do ... to bring growth, pipeline, commercial capability and near-term catalysts,"" she told reporters.
""We still will be open to other potential bolt-ons in business development,"" Walmsley added.
IMMUNOTHERAPY PIPELINE
GSK said buying Tesaro would weigh on adjusted earnings for the first two years by mid to high single digit percentage rates, but the acquisition should be accretive by 2022. The deal is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2019.
The company's dividend policy will not be affected by the deal and GSK still expects to pay 80 pence a share in 2018. 
Zejula's revenues in its current approved indication as second-line maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer were $166 million in the nine months to September.
Industry analysts, on average, expect annual Zejula sales to reach $1 billion by 2023, according to Refinitiv data.
In addition to Zejula, Tesaro also has several oncology medicines in development, including a number of experimental immunotherapy treatments.
That dovetails with GSK's other work in cancer, a field where it has had a patchy track record in the past.
Three years ago, GSK sold its established cancer medicines to Novartis. But it retained some early-stage projects that it now believes have the potential to leapfrog rivals and be at the forefront of treatment.
They include an antibody drug for multiple myeloma, which could be launched in 2020, as well as new kinds of cell therapies designed to modify patients' immune cells.
Tesaro shares, which have run up in recent weeks on takeover speculation, jumped 60 percent to nearly $74 in early trade on Nasdaq, while Clovis also gained 15 percent. 

Tesaro was advised by Citi and Centerview Partners, while PJT Partners and BoA Merrill Lynch worked for GSK.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Canada's construction steel buyers face tariff 'roulette',"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian steel buyers are racing to get construction steel into the country to claim first-come, first-serve exemptions from tariffs that were meant to stabilize the country's market in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's metals tariffs.
With steel prices already high, the companies that fabricate steel structures used in major building projects say the import controls, which cover at least 600,000 tonnes of steel, are making it even more difficult to operate because they cannot predict the price of basic materials. 
The disruption is the latest consequence of Canada's response to U.S. protectionism, which has been to layer on more tariffs to protect local mills owned by Stelco Holdings Inc and ArcelorMittal, raising metal prices in both countries. They are the public companies with primary steel mills as well as Essar, which owns a third primary mill. 
""It's causing havoc,"" said Cory Pittman, operations manager at Allstar Rebar in Newfoundland, on Canada's East Coast. ""Trying to run a business is like playing roulette."" Rebar is steel used to reinforce concrete and masonry. 
In late October Canada imposed a system of quotas and tariffs on seven categories of steel to prevent cheap metal from flooding into the country as Trump's tariffs forced overseas producers to seek new markets. But the first firm to get steel to a Canadian dock gets to use the tariff-free quota.
Shipments above previous average import levels from many countries now face a provisional 25 percent tariff. The quota system makes it impossible for buyers to know more than five days before delivery whether their goods will be subject to the tariff because there is no way to apply for quota in advance.
Canada, which produced about 14 million tonnes of steel in 2017, typically imports more of the metal than it exports, some 2.1 million tonnes more last year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The construction industry says only about one-half of its steel can be made in Canada. Because of its distance from Canadian mills, Newfoundland is particularly dependent on imports. Allstar is bidding on work for next year with no way of knowing whether it will have to pay a tariff on its raw materials.
Elsewhere, the chief executive officer of one West Coast fabricator recently traveled to Singapore to arrange a rush shipment of rebar back to Canada - something that was never necessary before.
'COST US DOWN THE ROAD'
Anoop Khosla, managing director of Midvalley Rebar in British Columbia, has been struggling to get quotes from overseas mills and fears they do not trust Canadian buyers to pay unexpected tariffs. 
""They don't want to risk production of that steel,"" he said. ""It's making us not a favored destination and that's going to cost us down the road."" 
Khosla is drafting contracts that would pass on tariffs to customers, but they are resisting. He said the Canadian government, at a minimum, needs a permitting system to give buyers clarity in advance. 
A regulatory change currently in the works could make that possible in the new year. If import controls stay in place, the government would consider allocating permits in advance to ""provide predictability to the market,"" Department of Finance spokesman Pierre-Olivier Herbert said in a statement. 
""Our government is listening to the concerns of some in the sector and is assessing ways to minimize the impact of safeguards in certain specific import situations, while maintaining the broad objectives of the provisional safeguards,"" he said. 
In the meantime, Walter Koppelaar, CEO of structural steel fabricator Walters Group, said the uncertainty is making it impossible to bid efficiently. Since the new quotas kicked in, Koppelaar has passed on some projects that would have required steel plate covered by the tariffs.
Fabricators cut, bend and assemble steel into large structures that support buildings and bridges.
At the same time, U.S. and Canadian tariffs have driven up the price of locally made steel across Canada and the United States, so Walters is paying more than it had expected for metal even for current projects. He recently met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

""I told her, when she's sitting in the House of Commons looking up at that beautiful new roof, remember the company in Hamilton that built it,"" he said. ""That was us.""

BMW still aims to reach an operating margin in the automotive segment of between 8 percent and 10 percent, Peter told analysts at a presentation in Munich on Monday.
""Whether we achieve this in 2019 will depend on many different factors,"" Peter said in remarks which were emailed to Reuters.
Tariffs, raw materials prices and the cost of putting expensive technologies in cars to reduce emissions will be a burden on earnings, BMW said.
Global tariffs between China and the United States will likely result in a charge in the mid three-digit million euro range in 2019, Peter said. 

BMW further said goodwill and warranty issues will impact earnings in the fourth quarter.

The move, which confirms a proposal made by the European Commission last year, could have repercussions for U.S. businesses and British clearing firms after Britain leaves the EU in March.
The text, if adopted in talks with EU lawmakers which will follow in the coming weeks, could concern LCH, a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), which dominates clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps and after Brexit will be outside the EU. The move could strip London of a chunk of that business.
If, ""as a measure of last resort and on the basis of a fully reasoned assessment"", the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) decided that a foreign clearing house is of systemic importance for the bloc's financial stability, it could force that firm ""to establish itself in the EU in order to be able to operate,"" the EU document said.
Even when relocation is not necessary, the draft rules would increase EU supervision of foreign clearers with activities in the bloc, a move that has been openly criticized by the U.S. financial regulator.
Christopher Giancarlo, chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), warned of possible retaliatory measures if EU regulators insisted on close supervision of U.S.-based clearing houses.

Large U.S. clearers such as CME and ICE (NYSE:ICE) could be concerned by the new rules.

1447,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 09:36AM ET</span>",Chipmakers are rallying after Trump and Xi reach tentative truce on trade war,"Chipmakers are rallying Monday as investors welcome the  tentative truce on the trade war between the US and China.
In a meeting at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Saturday, President Donald Trump agreed to postpone new tariffs on Chinese imports by three months and Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would purchase ""a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial"" amount of US agriculture, energy, and industrial products, according to a White House statement.
Negotiations have a 90-day window to discuss details on non-tariff barriers such as intellectual property protection, cyber threat, and forced technology transfer. If an agreement isn't reached by the end of the period, current 10% tariffs on $200 billion Chinese imports will jump to 25%, the White House said. 
""President Xi also stated that he is open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal should it again be presented to him,"" the White House added.
While the meeting didn't mean the trade war has come to an end, the agreement offered hope for a resolution of trade disputes, especially for the semiconductor industry that relies heavily on the manufacturing steps in multiple geographic regions, according to William Stein, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 
""This Statement is not a formal agreement, but the tone and direction seems very constructive for semis,"" said Stein in a note out on Monday."
1448,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 09:36AM ET</span>",'A bumpy ride ahead': Here's how Wall Street is reacting to Trump and Xi's trade war deal,"Presidents Trump and Xi came to a tentative truce on trade at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, postponing the next round of tariffs and agreeing to a 90-day window for further discussions.
This means that the US will not raise the 10% tariff rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% on January 1, as originally scheduled, while in return China has committed to buying a ""very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, (and) industrial"" goods from the US.
Expectations going into the summit were low, with many commentators saying that the meeting could actually make trade relations between the two nations even worse.  The positive nature of the talks has seen markets surge on Monday, most likely in relief than anything else.
But what are analysts saying about the agreement? Business Insider took a look at notes released by major research houses, investment banks, and asset managers since the deal was struck on Saturday evening. Check out 10 of the best below.
""The result is better than the market expected, but the huge divide remaining continues to suggest a bumpy ride ahead,"" Liu said.
""Comparing the official statements, we find that the US stresses more on China’s structural reform issues on forced technology transfer, IP protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft, services and agriculture, while China continues to highlight its willingness to increase imports from the US to reduce the trade imbalance as well as open its markets wider for foreign participation.""
""The effects of a truce period should provide investors some relief near term from the day-to-day concerns that have roiled the markets on the risk of a protracted trade war and the damage it could cause to global economic growth and corporate earnings over the course of the next year.
""The hope is that both sides will make good use of the truce period to find resolution to the trade dispute and remove the negative overhang that has held international equity market performance hostage since the summer.""
""At the same time, the deadline for the new trade talks has been set for 90 days. We think talks between the two countries are likely to hit some rough patches as the negotiations actually get under way.""
Looking forward, Nomura says the start of 2019 could be rocky for the markets with Brexit and company earnings helping add to the uncertainty around the trade war.
""We think the time limit of 90 days for the trade negotiations will only serve to heighten the chances that stock prices will weaken,"" the bank said."

The meeting comes as the Trump administration considers tariffs on cars imported from Europe and after China agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs on vehicles exported from the United States.
Although the European Commission handles trade negotiations on behalf of the common trading bloc, the Trump administration has summoned auto bosses as part of a campaign to ""rebalance"" global trade flows.
BMW on Monday said Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter will attend the meeting in Washington, while Daimler said Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche will be in attendance. VW declined to comment on whether its CEO Herbert Diess will go to the U.S.
The German car bosses will underline the European Commission's plea to cut tariffs on cars and to explain the importance that German industry plays as a net exporter of vehicles from the United States, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Monday.
""We are worried about tariffs. The German automotive industry relies on open markets,"" a senior German car executive, who was on his way to Washington, told Reuters.
""Countries have interests that they intend to pursue. We will look at addressing these issues. In this context, we appreciate the talks are taking place, it is better to talk with each other than about each other.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken an aggressive stance on trade issues, agreed in July not to impose higher duties on EU cars while the two sides sought to improve ties in a number of fields, from regulatory cooperation to energy and a deal to remove tariffs on industrial goods. 
Germany's Wirtschaftswoche magazine last week reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce would recommend a 25 percent customs duty on car imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said that although the European Union is formally responsible for negotiating trade on behalf of Germany, German carmakers play an important role in global trade.

""The German carmaker, or the German firms, are big employers in the United States of America so there is definitely reason to talk to the U.S. administration about issues like what investments and what future the German carmakers see as American employers,"" she said on Monday.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Moelis hires from BlackRock, hedge fund for activist defense team","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Investment bank Moelis & Co said on Monday it has hired an executive from the world's largest index fund manager, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), as well as a hedge fund professional, for its team advising companies facing activist shareholders.
Ted Moon, who had been a principal at Will Mesdag's hedge fund Red Mountain Capital Partners, recently joined Moelis as an executive director in its Los Angeles office, the bank confirmed on Monday.
Moelis said it also hired Peter da Silva Vint, a former vice president in BlackRock's investment stewardship unit, as an executive director at the firm's New York office. He starts on Monday.
""We are excited about the combination of them because they will allow us to provide more insightful advice to our clients in noncontested situations and advise them on how to interact and think about their shareholders and where their mindsets are,"" Craig Wadler, a managing director who heads Moelis' shareholder defense practice, said in an interview.
Moelis, which has advised activist investors in the past, does not work with activists anymore, following other banks seeking to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
The Moelis hires come as investors, including many hedge funds, are prodding corporations to shake up their businesses by spinning off units, buying back their own stock and sometimes overhauling management and boards of directors.
To defend against hedge funds such as Trian Fund Management and Third Point LLC, investment banks have been adding to their defense teams to offer corporate America more expertise on how to evaluate governance, executive compensation and other issues where they may be vulnerable.
Wadler said Moon and da Silva Vint have ""real experience"" in what activist hedge funds want to see done and how big index funds, which now make up the bulk of shareholders at many companies, think when it comes to voting as shareholders.
Other firms have also been seeking to get more into shareholder activist defending. In early November, financial public relations firm ICR launched a business to advise corporate boards and hired Lyndon Park, who previously headed global corporate governance at Dimensional Fund Advisors.
PJT Partners Inc, run by veteran investment banker Paul Taubman, in August paid $165 million to acquire shareholder advisory firm CamberView Partners, which companies often use to get a better sense of their shareholder base.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's relationship with state-backed Japan Investment Corp (JIC) has been damaged by excessive pay demands, an economy ministry official said on Monday.
JIC Chief Executive Masaaki Tanaka walked out of a Nov. 24 meeting to discuss remuneration levels at the investment fund, which was formed in September to manage more than $17 billion of public money, ministry official Keisuke Sasaki said.
JIC is seeking annual compensation of about 55 million yen ($480,000) for Tanaka and top management, Sasaki said, adding that this is higher than the Bank of Japan governor's 35.3 million yen and the 31.5 million yen paid to the president of the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF).
""Trust between the ministry and JIC's Tanaka has been damaged,"" Sasaki said. ""It is difficult for the government to ask JIC to manage 2 trillion yen.""
Takaka, a former deputy president of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306), said in October that JIC plans to set up funds with private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors.
JIC said in a statement on Monday that the compensation it sought was the same as offered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
Sasaki acknowledged that the ministry had previously offered to pay as much as 55 million yen to JIC's top management but rescinded that offer last month and asked the fund to reconsider salary levels.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tencent Music Entertainment launched its hotly-anticipated U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of up to $1.2 billion on Monday after global stock markets were boosted by a truce brokered by U.S. and Chinese leaders in their trade conflict.
The music arm of tech giant Tencent Holdings is looking to raise between $1.07 billion and $1.23 billion in a New York Stock Exchange IPO, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The company originally planned to launch its offering in mid-October, Reuters previously reported.
But it then decided to delay the IPO over worries the steep global stock market sell-off in the past few months would affect the pricing.
The decision by China and the United States to call a 90-day hiatus on their trade war over the weekend sent Asian shares soaring on Monday as markets breathed a sign of relief that tensions would ease, at least temporarily.
The music streaming giant is selling 82 million American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in a range of between $13 and $15 each, according to the filing. 
Tencent Music could sell an additional 12.3 million shares if an over-allotment option is exercised.
The $1.23 billion figure is smaller than the $2 billion that was earlier mooted as a fundraising target, though the company never confirmed such a number.
A source close to the deal said Tencent Music was keen to get itself listed this year because it was worried U.S.-China trade tensions would worsen, not because it desperately needed fresh money.
“It’s not worth waiting any longer for a potentially higher valuation if they have to deal with so many uncertainties,” said the source. 
At $1.23 billion, the IPO would still be one of the largest by a Chinese company in the United States this year, behind the $2.4 billion raised by video streaming company iQiyi in March and the $1.6 billion garnered by online group discounter Pinduoduo in July.
In total, Chinese companies have raised $7.8 billion from U.S. IPOs so far this year - the biggest amount since 2014 - according to Refinitiv data.
Tencent Music owns streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo as well as karaoke app WeSing, and claims more than 800 million monthly active users.
The company is targeting a valuation of between $22 billion and $25 billion, according to a source close to the deal, roughly on par with that of its Swedish music streaming counterpart Spotify Technology, which went public in New York in April and has a market value of $24.3 billion.
Tencent Music, which has a cross shareholding deal with Spotify, offers more in the way of socially interactive services that makes it profitable. 
It reported a 244 percent jump in profit in the first nine months of this year to $394 million from $114 million in the same period in 2017. By comparison, its Swedish peer posted a net loss of $520 million over the first nine months of the year. 
The company will open its books on Dec. 4 and shares will begin trading on Dec. 12, according to the source.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the lead sponsors of the deal.

1462,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",China Stimulus Decisions Loom as Trade Deal Fuels Uncertainty,"(Bloomberg) -- Saturday’s deal between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump does little to alleviate the economic slowdown and uncertainty roiling China’s economy, meaning targeted stimulus will likely continue into 2019.
Domestic demand is still slowing and the economy will expand at the lowest pace in almost two decades next year, according to a Bloomberg survey. Managing the slowdown as the clock ticks toward a new deadline for a trade deal in March will be a key task for the Communist Party’s annual gathering to set economic policy, which is usually held in December.
""If I were the Chinese policy makers, I would definitely be planning for a great deal of uncertainties continuing into next year,” said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “I think they will continue to carefully calibrate ways to support the economy without putting their foot on the gas,"" he said.”
The following details the main economic policy considerations in light of the agreement in Buenos Aires.
Monetary Policy
The median forecast for the People’s Bank of China’s main interest rates remains unchanged, but there’s a growing group of economists betting on a broad rate cut in 2019.
The lack of obvious success from earlier easing and the recent dovish tone from the Federal Reserve have strengthened that case, though such a move would increase downward pressure on the yuan and make the campaign to clean up the financial system harder. However, the trade deal, especially if it results in lasting peace, would reduce pressure on the currency, providing room for the PBOC.
However, it’s more likely that the central bank will continue the current policies of lowering the amount of cash that banks have to put aside as reserves, and injecting long-term liquidity by offering more loans via the Medium-term Lending Facility.
Fiscal Policy
There’s more room for fiscal stimulus. The government will likely raise the budget deficit ratio and also expand the quota for special government bonds, which are mainly used to finance local infrastructure projects.
Another tool the government can use is front-loading expenditure, spending more, earlier. The leadership has also promised more cuts to taxes and social security contributions.
Debt Cleanup
One possible outcome of a slower growth in 2019 could be a rebound in the macro leverage ratio. That’s because the expansion of the economy may be slower than that of debt, pushing up the ratio.
A gradual negotiation of trade tensions could allow China to continue the current pace of debt cleanup. That campaign, while aiming to reduce risk in the system, has made it harder for many private companies to get funding, and that’s raised concerns about long-term growth. A reduction in trade and political tensions with the U.S. would help alleviate some of the worries international and domestic investors have about China.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - French stocks sensitive to the economy and to tourism fell in an otherwise buoyant market on Monday after the worst riots in decades swept Paris, stirring concerns about the possible damage from visitors steering clear of the capital. 
Supermarket  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and highway operator  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) were the worst-performing, down 2.1 and 2.6 percent respectively. Shares in hotel chain  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and airline Air France (PA:AIRF) fell by 1.6 and 2.7 percent. 
Nationwide protests against fuel taxes and living costs, known as the ""yellow vest"" movement after fluorescent jackets kept in all vehicles in France, escalated on Saturday as rioters ran amok across central Paris, torching cars and looting shops.
Investors and traders connected the stock falls to investors' unease over the potential impact riots could have on the economy and on tourists' appetite to visit the capital.
""Accor is falling, and it is fair to say that investors are wondering if there will be cancellations at their hotels,"" said Jerome Schupp, a fund manager at Geneva-based firm Prime Partners.
""It's not good to see those images of a major capital,"" said a trader. ""It could hurt the economy.""
Highway operator Vinci Autoroutes said the ""yellow vest"" protests were continuing to have a major impact, although it did not specify any figures in a press release on Monday morning. 
Traders said the earnings conglomerate Vinci gets from its motorway concessions could be hit by the protests, which have blocked toll roads across France.
Oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) said on Monday several dozen of its gasoline stations had run dry as a more than two-week long protest over fuel tax hikes began to impact fuel reserves and distribution.

The falls came even as France's top stock index (FCHI) climbed 1.7 percent, on track for its best day in a month after a truce in the U.S.-China trade war lifted global markets.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) is to buy GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) Horlicks nutrition business for $3.8 billion, boosting the Anglo-Dutch group's position in India with the addition of the malted drink.
The deal, announced on Monday, increases the consumer goods giant's footprint in one the world's fastest-growing economies and marks a notable addition to the portfolio by outgoing Chief Executive Paul Polman, who steps down in January.
For GSK boss Emma Walmsley, it is a chance to further streamline operations and generate cash for increased investment in pharmaceuticals.
The sale follows a competitive auction in which Unilever saw off rival Nestle (S:NESN), as well as earlier interest from Coca-Cola (N:KO).
The transaction covers GSK's health food and drinks portfolio in India, Bangladesh and 20 other predominantly Asian markets. The business has annual sales of around 550 million euros, primarily through the malt-based Horlicks and Boost brands.
Horlicks comfortably dominates the health-drinks market in India and Unilever is expected to try and give it a fresh lease of life, following a slowdown in sales growth in recent years.
HUL finance head Srinivas Phatak told reporters he expected the business to grow at a double-digit percentage rate in the medium term, boosting both earnings and profit margins.
GSK's decision to sell the business follows its $13 billion acquisition of Novartis's (S:NOVN) stake in the two groups' consumer health joint venture earlier this year. GSK said at the time that selling Horlicks could support the funding of the  Novartis  buyout. 
The main asset being sold is GSK's 72.5 percent stake in Indian-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (NS:GLSM).
Unilever said its 3.3 billion euros ($3.75 billion) consideration would be paid in cash and shares in its subsidiary in India,  Hindustan Unilever  Limited (HUL) (NS:HLL).
Shares in both Indian companies rose more than 4 percent on Monday.
GSK said its net proceeds from the deal, after tax and hedging costs, were expected to be around 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion).
Following the closure of the deal, which is expected in around 12 months, GSK will own approximately 5.7 percent of HUL and the British drugmaker intends to sell this down in tranches.
The price being paid for the GSK business is broadly in line with expectations. People familiar with the process had told Reuters it was likely to be sold for less than $4 billion.
GSK was advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Greenhill, while BofA Merrill Lynch worked with Unilever.
Horlicks traces its history back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, founded a company in Chicago to manufacture it. It was taken to India by soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War.

Sold as a bedtime drink in Britain, it was developed into a much bigger brand by GSK in India, although more recently its growth as slowed as urban Indian consumers turn to healthier, less-sugary alternatives.

LONDON (Reuters) - Miners, autos, tech, and oil stocks surged on Monday, driving Europe's main benchmarks up strongly after U.S. and Chinese leaders agreed a temporary truce in a trade war.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) – the most sensitive to China and trade war fears – led the way with a 2.6 percent rise to its highest level since Nov 14. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.8 percent, set for its strongest day in eight months. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a truce at the G20 meeting on Saturday, halting additional tariffs and agreeing to fresh talks aimed at reaching an agreement within 90 days.
Although markets reacted positively, some investors and analysts said there remained much for the two to agree upon. 
""While President Trump described the bilateral meeting with China as ""amazing and productive"", we believe the rivalry between the U.S. and China will not be easily overcome, especially over the issue of intellectual property and market access,"" said UBS Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele in a note.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said the announcement strengthened their view that ""Trump is likely to want to conclude an agreement - even if it does not include a full rollback of tariffs - well ahead of the 2020 presidential election"".
Financials were the biggest driver of European shares as China-exposed bank HSBC (L:HSBA) rose and investors cheered the prospect of a end to a trade war which has dented growth.
Mining stocks (SXPP) led the gains and were up 5.1 percent on the news which gives China, the world's biggest metals consumer, more wiggle room in the next few months.
 Antofagasta  (L:ANTO),  Anglo American  (L:AAL), and  Glencore  (L:GLEN) were up 6.2 to 8.6 percent.
Car stocks (SXAP), which have been battered by fears of rising tariffs, jumped 4.2 percent after Trump said China agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars.
German carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) climbed 4.8 to 6.2 percent, while tire maker Continental (DE:CONG) gained 4.1 percent and  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) rose 6.9 percent.
Tech stocks (SX8P) jumped 3.1 percent with chipmakers the best-performing. Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and AMS (S:AMS) gained 5.8 to 6.7 percent. 
Overall analysts have cut their 2019 earnings growth expectations for world stocks over the past month as concern grew that a trade war would compound the impact of a slowing global economy. 
The oil sector (SXEP) also jumped 2.7 percent as crude soared ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting, expected to result in a supply cut.
Luxury stocks highly sensitive to China were also among top gainers, with heavyweight conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH) up 5.9 percent and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) rising 6.1 percent.
Away from the trade war relief, shares in French supermarkets  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), underperformed after riots in Paris on Saturday.
Carrefour was down 1.1 percent and Casino was up just 0.5 percent, while France's main CAC 40 rose 2 percent.
Argenx (BR:ARGX) topped the STOXX with an 11.3 percent gain after the Netherlands-based biopharma company said it signed a deal worth potentially up to $1.6 billion with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) affiliate Cilag to develop its Cusatuxumab drug in certain types of cancer.

European share benchmarks opened sharply higher, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) - the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - leading the way with a 2.5 percent rise to its highest level since Nov. 14, and Wall Street too was set for a stronger session.
The gains came after China and the United States agreed at the weekend to halt additional tariffs on each other. The deal prevents their trade war escalating as the two sides try to bridge differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. 
U.S. President Donald Trump also said ""China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40 percent"". That helped boost European autos more than 4 percent (SXAP).
""We have a deal. That's wonderful news for global financial markets and signaling the start for a year-end rally in risky assets,"" said Bernd Berg global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management.
""We are going to see a rally in emerging market and U.S equities, EM currencies and China-related assets like Australia. I expect the rally to last until year-end.""
MSCI's all-country world index (MIWD00000PUS) climbed 0.9 percent in its sixth straight day of gains and hit its highest level since Nov. 9. Emerging equities (MSCIEF) rose 2.1 percent and were set for their strongest day in a month.
Asian shares kicked off the gains, with Chinese mainland markets (CSI300) (SSEC) rising more than 2.5 percent while Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained as much as 1.3 percent to a six-week high.
The risk-on mood drove the U.S. dollar 0.4 percent lower against a basket of currencies (DXY) while against the euro it slumped 0.6 percent (EUR=EBS).
The greenback has already come under some pressure from the recent subtle shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy communication to a slightly more dovish stance. Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes.
Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee but his hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honor of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday.
Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg, said the market rally would not bring a return to a more hawkish Fed stance. 
""We would need to see some rebound in economic activity to lift expectations of more rate hikes,"" he said.
The Powell comments had sent U.S. Treasury yields lower but they pulled back from the over two-month lows hit on Friday as 10-year yields rose three basis points to 3.04 percent (US10YT=RR). 
Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, was set for its biggest one-day yield jump in a month, rising four basis points to a high of 0.347 percent (DE10YT=RR). Yields on riskier southern European bonds fell across the board, with Italian yields down around 10 bps to new two-month lows. (IT5YT=RR), (IT10YT=RR).
Emerging currencies were among the main beneficiaries of dollar weakness, with an MSCI index up 0.6 percent <.MIEM00000PUS>. It was led by China's yuan which rose one percent for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 2016 .
""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai.
Elsewhere, oil soared more than five percent, a positive start after it had posted its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>","Dealmaker Albert Frere, Belgium's richest man, dies aged 92","By Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Albert Frere, a veteran dealmaker whose impeccable business timing made him Belgium's richest man, died on Monday at the age of 92, the firm he built, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), said.
Frere had stepped down as a director of GBL and GBL's Swiss-based shareholder Pargesa three years ago, though he remained one of the controlling shareholders of the group run since 2012 by his son-in-law, Ian Gallienne, who is co-CEO.
Frere attained international prominence in the early 1980s, helping divest some of nationalized French bank Paribas' foreign assets and setting up Pargesa with Canadian businessman Paul Desmarais, who died in 2013.
Both speaking native French with non-French accents, the pair forged a bond working together on Paribas.
""I guess the French asked themselves: ‘Who are those weirdos?’"" Frere said in a rare newspaper interview in 2010.
With Pargesa’s backing, Frere took control of GBL in 1982. It survived the collapse in 1990 of its U.S. investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert amid a scandal over its promotion of highly leveraged buyouts and ""junk bonds"".
His career started when he inherited his family business, trading in nails, and set out to acquire a string of steel businesses around his home city of Charleroi after World War Two. He left school to run the business aged 17.
""Albert Frere, honorary chairman and co-controlling shareholder of the company, passed away today,"" GBL said in a statement on its website on Monday.
""For more than three decades, under his leadership, GBL became one of the largest holdings in Europe. His professional and human qualities have deeply marked our group.""
Through the group, Frere held significant stakes in some of Europe's biggest companies, including Adidas (DE:ADSGn),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) and  Total  (PA:TOTF).
Often Frere played a role as a consolidator, where he traded a large stake in a smaller company against a small stake in a larger company. This was the case in the sale of Belgian energy company PetroFina to Total, media group RTL to Bertelsmann, or in the giant cement merger between Lafarge and  Holcim .

Together with Bernard Arnaud of France's LVMH luxury group, Frere, who was made a baron by the Belgian king, owned acclaimed French wine estate Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion near Bordeaux. But he himself never moved far from his birthplace near Charleroi, at the heart of Belgium's coal and steel belt.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:37AM ET</span>","Trump tweets China to cut tax on U.S.-made cars, revs up auto stocks","By David Lawder and Adam Jourdan
WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said China had agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars, buoying shares in BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) who manufacture in the United States for export to the world's biggest auto market.
Shares of Chinese car dealers also perked up on hopes that such a move could revitalize the domestic auto market that is poised for its first annual sales contraction in decades amid cooling economic growth and a debilitating U.S.-China trade war. 
Trump, fresh from agreeing a 90-day cease-fire in his trade war with China at the meeting of the G20, said on Twitter ""China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%"".
The move, if realized, would bolster U.S. carmakers who were hit hard when China ramped up levies on U.S.-made cars in July as part of a broad package of retaliatory tariffs amid the sprawling trade war between Washington and Beijing.
""If they cancel the extra 25 percent tariff on U.S.-made cars, then we will see positive signs for imported cars,"" Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association's import committee, told reporters in Beijing.
Beijing raised tariffs on U.S. auto imports to 40 percent in July, forcing many carmakers to hike prices in a major hit to the roughly $10 billion worth of passenger vehicles the United States sent to China last year.
That put U.S.-made car brands like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Lincoln at a major disadvantage as the move came soon after China slashed auto import tariffs for the wider market to 15 percent from 25 percent. 
Trump's tweet did not give any further detail about the tariff cuts, such as when the deal had been reached or a new level for the Chinese levies.
The White House and U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Sunday. China's commerce and finance ministries did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.
SHARES CLIMB
In early European trade on Monday, shares in Germany's BMW, Volkswagen ASG (DE:VOWG_p) and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler rose between 4-7 percent.
In China, listed car dealers such as Grand Automotive (SS:600297), Pangda Automobile Trade (SS:601258) and Sinomach Automobile (SS:600335) climbed on the news, with some local carmakers falling back.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to halt new tariffs during talks in Argentina on Saturday, following months of escalating tensions on trade and other issues.
After a 2-1/2 hour dinner with Xi on Saturday in Buenos Aires, Trump agreed to postpone an increase in the tariff rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent that was scheduled for Jan. 1. China agreed to resume purchases of some U.S. farm and energy commodities.
The two sides also agreed to negotiate in the next 90 days over ""structural changes"" to China's policies on technology transfers, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and theft, services and agriculture.
Major U.S. automakers said they were unaware of the lower tariffs on exports to China. 
The automakers have a previously scheduled meeting with USTR on Monday, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The lower tariffs would be a boost to automakers exporting vehicles to China, including Ford and German carmaker BMW, which exports U.S.-built luxury vehicles to China.
It would also be good news for Tesla that has been hit hard by increased tariffs on the electric cars it imports to China.
The U.S. firm, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said it will cut prices to make its cars ""more affordable"" and absorb more of the hit from the tariffs. Tesla is also building a local plant in Shanghai to help it avoid steep tariffs.

The United States currently charges tariffs of 27.5 percent on Chinese vehicles. On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had directed him to examine all available tools to raise U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicles to the level that China is charging.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Bank of America completes Brexit switch to Dublin,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Bank of America (N:BAC) finished moving its banking and markets operations in Europe to a new base in Dublin from London, the bank said on Monday, after it received all necessary regulatory and court approvals. 
International banks are setting up subsidiaries across the European Union to ensure they can continue to serve clients. Their London operations may lose the right to operate across the EU with Britain's departure from the bloc in March still filled with uncertainty.
As part of its preparation for Brexit, Bank of America announced last year that it would merge Bank of America Merrill Lynch International, its London-based subsidiary, into its Irish entity based in Dublin.
""We are pleased to have worked closely and constructively with our regulators to complete this critical component of our Brexit preparations exactly on schedule and well ahead of the earliest possible date of the UK's exit from the EU,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch Europe chair Anne Finucane said in a statement.
Bank of America last year became the first U.S. bank to pick Dublin as its new base for its EU operations, as the Irish capital's growing financial center competes with the likes of Frankfurt and Paris to win business leaving London.
Ireland's central bank said in October that it is processing over 100 Brexit-related applications to authorize firms across sectors including investment management, banking, payments and insurance.
The regulator is still receiving applications from small to medium financial firms looking to set up or extend operations in Dublin, and it is aware of more to be submitted as the Brexit clock ticks down, an official familiar with the process said last month.
Bank of America will relocate up to 125 jobs from Britain, mostly to Ireland, as part of the move, according to a corporate filing seen by Reuters earlier this year.
The bank said employees in finance, risk, compliance, technology and credit functions would be affected. The moves will be a combination of staff relocation and new hires. It is set to take place between July and December this year.
The roles represent a first phase of job moves. A second is possible depending on the outcome of Britain's negotiations with the EU, the bank said. The second phase would mostly relocate jobs to France, with some going to Ireland, Germany and other locations. 

Bank of America said on Monday that it now employs over 800 people in Dublin and that its new European headquarters would operate through branches in Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Zurich.

Futures on U.S. indices also surged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all getting ready to open almost 2% higher.
The renewed appetite for stocks followed a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump Saturday night during the G20 summit in Argentina. The two presidents agreed to not introduce any new tariffs for 90 days while talks on a trade deal step up.
“This is the best outcome that we had hoped for out of this meeting,” Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpack Banking Group told Bloomberg.
While the trade dispute between the two countries is not resolved yet, a significant easing of tensions would help stocks across the region. Bourses have been pricing in the likely impact of an expected increase in U.S. tariffs on Jan. 1 on about $200 billion worth of Chinese exports.
By mid-morning Monday, virtually all significant bourses in Asia were higher.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 2.83%% to 27,258 by 9:35PM EST (02:10AM GMT), starting December on a strong note after finishing November with the highest monthly gain in years.
Bourses in mainland China were also up surging as investors hoped an easing of tension would revive bourses that have taken a beating this year. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.72% to 2,658 and the Shenzhen Component Index surged 3.37% to 7,940.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was up 1.39% to 22,661 and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 1.78% at 2,134.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up 1.66% to 5,761.
Bourses elsewhere in places like Singapore, the Philippines and Taiwan were also trading higher.
“In contrast to the fear – especially in Asia – that the hawks in (the) US administration would make impossible demands, evidence of President Trump working towards a trade deal with China has emerged,” said Helen Qiao, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in a note to clients referenced by CNBC. “Obviously there is a long way to go here, but the pattern of previous deals is playing out.”

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 3.1 percent to a two-month high, while the yuan rose 0.5 percent to 6.9163 per dollar in offshore trading. The agreement means the U.S. will hold off on its prior plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, which were set to take effect from January.
The news boosted risk assets globally on Monday, encouraging strategists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to upgrade their already-positive forecast for China’s stocks next year. But skeptics say it will take more than a pause on tariffs to turn around the negative sentiment that’s blanketed mainland markets this year. Weaker economic growth remains a key overhang for investors, who are still reckoning with soaring corporate defaults and a bear market in stocks.
“The trade situation is slightly better than before but there’s no substantial development,” said Hao Hong, a strategist with Bocom International Holdings Co. “What we have now is a truce at the best. This may produce a short-term rebound, though the resilience of the rally depends on how soon everyone will begin to see the situation through.”
The Shanghai Composite Index is among the world’s worst benchmarks this year, down 22 percent for its worst annual performance since 2008. The yuan has weakened about 10 percent since a high in April.

The Nikkei 225 ranks its companies by the arbitrary measure of the price of one share, unlike most stock indexes where market capitalization -- or size -- is key.
Some of the companies that make up the biggest proportions of the Nikkei 225 have been standout performers this year. Take FamilyMart UNY Holdings Co., a convenience-store operator whose shares have more than doubled in 2018. The stock has the fourth-largest weighting on the Nikkei 225, accounting for 2.7 percent of the index, which is more than 14 times its weighting on the Topix.
Another example is Fast Retailing Co., which has the largest weighting in the Nikkei 225, comprising almost 10 percent of the gauge, compared with just 0.3 percent of the Topix. Its shares are up 31 percent this year, set for their best annual performance since 2013.
And SoftBank Group Corp., which accounts for 4.7 percent of the Nikkei 225, rose in November ahead of the initial public offering of its mobile unit.
The Nikkei 225 is down 1.8 percent this year versus an 8.3 percent decline in the Topix.
Nikkei Drawbacks
To Fujito, the Nikkei 225’s outperformance is just a reminder of the drawbacks of price-weighted stock indexes.
“If a hedge fund wanted to artificially boost the level of the Nikkei 225, they don’t have to buy 220-something stocks,” he said. “They could have a significant impact by putting selected shares into a basket and buying them.”
Still, it’s difficult to ignore the Nikkei 225. It’s the most common benchmark for pricing derivatives in the country’s $5.8 trillion equity market.
“The Topix is what reflects reality,” Fujito said. “It’s an irony that despite its big flaw, the Nikkei 225 is such a well-recognized measure.”

S&P 500 e-mini futures (ESc1) were up 1.6 percent on high contract volume after trading resumed for the week at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT). Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures (1YMc1) rose 1.8 percent, while Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures (NQc1) jumped nearly 2 percent.
After getting clobbered for much of the past two months, U.S. stocks rallied last week on optimism that a detente could be reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, over trade between the world's top two economies.
The outcome of the meeting between the two leaders in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 summit over the weekend appeared to set the stage for further gains. The two agreed to de-escalate tensions over trade that have dogged U.S. and global markets off and on throughout the year. 
A U.S. pledge not to boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods could mark the most important deal in years between the two countries. 
For the full week ended Friday, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gained nearly 5 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC,> loaded with tech companies that had been buffeted by costs associated with tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese imports, gained more than 5.6 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the darkest clouds hanging over Wall Street somewhat dissipated on Saturday when China and the United States agreed to shelve any new tariffs and reset discussions, at least temporarily halting an increase in their tensions over trade. 
Investors said the agreement, lasting 90 days, between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump at the G20 summit spelled a reprieve for stocks and could pave the way for a positive bookend to a volatile trading year.
The trade tension between Washington and Beijing, along with an uncertain outlook for U.S. rate hikes, have for months dogged prospects for equities. The U.S. pledge not to boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods could mark the most important deal in years between the world's top two economies.
""It sets a pretty positive tone (and) stocks should have a decent rally into December,"" said Nathan Thooft, Boston-based global head of asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management.
Thooft said he believed the Trump administration was using a threat to raise tariffs to 25 percent on Jan. 1, from 10 percent now as a negotiating tactic. ""So when you start to see evidence that there is the ability to come to some type of agreement, that has to be viewed as a positive,"" he said.
The stock market logged an official correction after a selloff in October and continued volatility in November that, just over a week ago, had left the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index down 10 percent from its all-time high.
Markets rebounded last week on comments perceived as dovish from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, though the S&P is up only 2.4 percent in 2018.
The latest trade standoff began in September when the United States imposed the 10 percent tariffs, prompting China to respond with its own. Ahead of the leaders' dinner in Argentina, investors were bracing for a range of outcomes including a worse-case end to talks and more tit-for-tat measures that would continue to crimp economic and corporate profit growth. 
Instead, the Americans and Chinese officially lauded the result.
Beijing agreed to buy what the White House called a ""very substantial"" amount of agriculture, energy, industrial and other products. While the clock ticks on the 90-day tariff reprieve, the two sides will try to work out thorny issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and cyber theft. 
""It's not solved by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Thooft. But risk assets and cyclical U.S. sectors like materials and industrials should benefit, he said on Sunday. 
Energy prices could also rebound on Monday since cooling trade tensions could boost the world economy and spur demand. Oil prices have dropped from a four-year high of about $76 per barrel in early October to just above $50 on Friday.
POWELL TESTIMONY
Aside from trade policy, Wall Street's attention has also been trained on Fed policy. 
Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee. But the hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed Wednesday in honor of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday at the age of 94.
Last week, Powell said that while the Fed's gradual tightening balances risks to the economy, the policy rate was ""just below"" a range of estimates of the so-called neutral level that neither stimulates nor cools growth. In response, stocks shot up and largely recovered November's earlier losses. 
In the wake of Powell's speech, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said ""what happens in Buenos Aires will determine if stocks post a positive 2018.""
The specter of a global trade war has hovered over the market since March, when Trump announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also recently said the United States was studying auto tariffs, which could ripple through Europe and Japan, while a pact with Canada and Mexico left some investors heartened about potential progress with China.
Nancy Lazar, economist at research firm Cornerstone Macro, said in a notes that the 90-day tariff delay and China's ""incremental concessions"" are good news. 
""But given the stern U.S. stance, we're certainly not raising our outlook,"" she said of a 2.8-percent growth estimate for the fourth quarter, still comfortably above potential. 

With U.S. corporate leaders increasingly voicing concerns over rising costs associated with tariffs, Wall Street on Monday should welcome any development that eases those pressures.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 02:13PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nexstar clinches $4.1 billion deal to acquire Tribune Media - sources,"By Carl O'Donnell and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Nexstar Media Group Inc has reached an agreement to acquire Tribune Media Co for about $4.1 billion, a deal which would make it the largest local U.S. TV station operator, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Nexstar's acquisition would come just three months after Tribune's $3.9 billion deal to sell itself to Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, currently the largest U.S. local TV station operator, collapsed over regulatory hurdles.
Nexstar outbid private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC with an all-cash offer that values Tribune at around $46.50 per share, three sources said. Tribune shares ended trading on Friday at $40.26. 
Nexstar, which has a market capitalization of $3.8 billion, has lined up banks to provide debt financing for the deal, the sources added.
The agreement between Nexstar and Tribune Media could be announced by Monday, according to the sources. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Tribune and Apollo declined to comment, while Nexstar and Sinclair did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tribune terminated its deal with Sinclair in August, and filed a lawsuit arguing that the latter mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.
However, since then the broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks, amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. The FCC has yet to vote on the matter.
Based in Irving, Texas, Nexstar owns, operates and provides sales and other services to 174 television stations reaching nearly 39 percent of all U.S. television households. Apollo also approached Nexstar this summer about acquiring it, but was rebuffed, Reuters previously reported. 
Based in Chicago, Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households. It also owns national entertainment cable network WGN America, whose reach is more than 77 million households, and a variety of digital applications and websites commanding 54 million monthly unique visitors online, according to its website. It also has a stake in the Food Network.
Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and completed a spinoff of its newspaper assets in 2014.
More TV station deals are in the works. Privately held Cox Enterprises Inc announced in July that it was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale, for the 14 broadcast TV stations it owns in cities such as Atlanta, Boston and Memphis. [nFWN1VC0HO]
Sinclair is currently also pursuing its own separate deal, having partnered with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd to bid for the regional sports networks that Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) is selling following its deal to merge most of its assets with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, sources have previously said.
When it came to the previous Tribune Media deal, FCC said Sinclair did not “fully disclose facts” relating to the planned sale of three stations, including pre-existing business relationships the company had with prospective buyers.
Sinclair has a politically conservative streak in the news broadcasts of many of its stations, leading to U.S. President Donald Trump to criticize the FCC over the collapse of the acquisition of Tribune Media in the summer. 

""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People,” Trump wrote on Twitter last July.

China and the United States agreed at the summit to halt additional tariffs for 90 days as they try to prevent their trade war from escalating.
The G20 nations also backed an overhaul of the World Trade Organization (WTO), marking a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of the organization that regulates international trade disputes. 
DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said an agreement by the leaders of the 20 largest industrialized nations to reform the WTO was the most important outcome of the two-day summit in Buenos Aires.
However, he cautioned that significant challenges remain.
""The G20 summit offered German industry some breathing room,"" he said in a statement. ""But rising protectionism is not off the table. The differences between the United States and China, in particular, are too great."" 
At the same time, he said, the dialogue among world leaders in Argentina provided a glimmer of hope.
""It is always better to speak with one another than to torment one another with new tariffs and trade barriers,"" he added.
Leading executives from German carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are due to meet at the White House to discuss trade policy next week. 
They hope to stave off punitive tariffs but will make clear that they cannot negotiate on behalf of the European Union.
Trump, angered by what he sees as an unfair trade imbalance in the sector, has threatened to impose tariffs on EU-assembled vehicles in a move that could upend the industry's business model for selling cars in the United States.

However, Trump has refrained from such measures while Washington and Brussels undertake talks to cut other trade barriers.

Speculation about a possible merger has continued despite the bank's dismissal in September of reports that it could consider tie-ups with Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG) or German peer Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""I don't have any indication of that,"" Christian Sewing told Bild am Sonntag. ""We are on track to make our first profit for three years. It is only a matter of time before this progress is reflected in the share price.""
Sewing's remarks followed the two-day raid as part of an investigation linked to the so-called Panama Papers leak of documents about offshore finance.
Police searched the offices of all the bank's board members, Sewing said.
""But that is okay, I don't have a problem with that. I want this matter to be cleared up as soon as possible,"" he told the newspaper.

The agreement comes at a difficult time for Italian banks as a sharp rise in state borrowing costs under a eurosceptic government has devalued banks' sovereign bond holdings, eroding their capital buffers.
It has also depressed the prices they can fetch for their bad loans, which were already well below book value.
Under the deal, announced late on Friday, Banco BPM will boost its capital by selling its consumer credit business Pro Family to an existing joint venture it has with Credit Agricole for 310 million euros. 
This will provide a capital boost to offset the hit from the large disposal of bad loans below book value. To reap a further capital benefit, Banco BPM said it was also selling part of its debt recovery unit.
The lender said it was continuing negotiations with all three groups of bidders for the bad loans and had given its CEO a mandate to reach a deal.
Banco BPM said it had extended its partnership with Credit Agricole for the next 15 years and the two groups will consider a possible stock market leasing of their joint consumer credit business at some point in the next two years.
Banco BPM said it had an option to reduce its stake in the joint venture but was unlikely to exercise it.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",List of missing in California's deadliest wildfire drops sharply,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - Two days after authorities in Northern California ended their search for human remains from the deadliest wildfire in state history, the number of people listed as missing was reduced on Friday to fewer than 50, down from the nearly 200 last tallied.
The confirmed death toll from the Camp Fire stood unchanged from the past few days at 88, but the newly revised roster of people still unaccounted for came as welcome news three weeks after flames ravaged the Sierra foothills town of Paradise.
At a news conference on Wednesday night, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said search and recovery teams had finished combing through the ruins of approximately 18,000 homes and other buildings incinerated by the blaze.
The missing-persons list then consisted of 196 names, though Honea said he was hopeful that many individuals would eventually turn up alive as they realized that loved ones were looking for them.
By Friday night, the whereabouts of most had, indeed, been determined, and the list was winnowed down again to just 49 names, the sheriff's office said. 
That total was by far the smallest to date, greatly diminishing the number of people who might potentially be declared missing and presumed dead. 
Honea has acknowledged the possibility that some who perished in the blaze might never be found, but he also has refused to speculate on how many such cases might exist.
The number of missing has fluctuated widely since the fire erupted on Nov. 8, briefly exceeding 1,200 names about two weeks ago.
With the fire now reduced to embers, the National Weather Service issued flash-flood warnings on Thursday and Friday for the burn zone as showers and thunderstorms heightened the risk of heavy runoff in areas stripped of vegetation by the fire.
The bulk of the devastation occurred in and around the hamlet of Paradise, a town once home to almost 27,000 people, many of them retirees, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. 
The current death toll already ranks as the greatest loss of life on record from a California wildfire and the most from a wildfire anywhere in the United States, dating back to Minnesota's 1918 Cloquet Fire, which killed as many as 1,000 people.
Authorities attribute the Camp Fire's high casualty count in large part to the tremendous speed with which flames raced through Paradise with little warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees.
Remains of many victims were found in the ashen rubble of homes, others inside or near the burned-out wreckage of vehicles. 

The cause of the blaze remained under investigation. But electric utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) reported equipment problems near the origin of the fire around the time it began.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 07:49PM ET</span>","United moves deeper into Latin America with Avianca, Copa tie-up","By Tracy Rucinski and Marcelo Rochabrun
CHICAGO, SAO PAULO (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Friday said it had finalized a three-way joint venture with carriers Avianca Holdings SA (CN:AVT_p) of Colombia and Copa Airlines of Panama, giving the U.S. airline a deeper foothold in Latin America where travel demand is rising.
Like its main U.S. rivals, No. 3 U.S. carrier United has been eyeing untapped potential for leisure and business travelers in Latin America, where many still travel long distances by car and bus. 
United, Avianca and Copa are already codeshare partners and Star Alliance members, but a joint venture will allow them to plan routes and fares together and share revenues on those routes.
Shares in each of the three carriers ended higher on Friday. 
Under the deal, United said it would provide a $456 million term loan to cash-strapped Avianca's top shareholder, Synergy Group Corp. Loss-making Avianca has a roughly $4 billion debt pile, of which 40 percent is due within the next two years, according to recent financial statements.
Latin American airlines in general have experienced a turbulent few years, hit by a double whammy of high oil prices and devaluing currencies in local markets, which make it more expensive to cover dollar-denominated costs like fuel and aircraft rent.
Travel has also suffered in the dominant regional economy Brazil, which has suffered from its deepest recession in decades but remains the largest aviation market in the region, and one of the biggest in the world.
United, which already owns an 8 percent stake in Brazilian carrier Azul SA, said it was exploring the possibility of adding the country to its joint partnership with Avianca and Copa.
The three carriers' agreement is subject to regulatory approval in the United States and several jurisdictions in Central and South America. Copa Airlines said in a press release that process would take between 12 and 18 months.
However, a similar deal between  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) and Chile's  Latam Airlines  Group (SN:LTM) signed in January 2016 only received Chilean antitrust approval last month.

United's deal with Avianca, long in the works, had undergone significant legal back-and-forth after the Colombian flagship carrier's No. 2 shareholder Kingsland Ltd tried to halt negotiations between United and Synergy. The parties eventually came to an agreement.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 05:56PM ET</span>",Microsoft's market value overtakes Apple's to close out week,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) stock market value closed above Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) for the first time in eight years on Friday as the Windows maker benefited from growth in cloud computing while Apple was hit by investor concern about iPhone demand.
Shares of Microsoft rose 0.6 percent to end the week at $110.89, putting its market capitalization at $851.2 billion. Apple shares fell 0.5 percent to $178.58 on the day, adding up to a market value of $847.4 billion.
The two stocks jostled for the top spot over the course of the week, with Microsoft's stock market value exceeding Apple's at several points in intra-day trading but not at the close. 
Both companies' market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.
Apple's market capitalization overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone. 
After Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
In recent months, technology shares have been punished by investors worried about rising interest rates and the potential consequences of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Apple shares are now 19.6 percent lower than on Nov. 1, when the company warned after the regular session that holiday-quarter sales would likely miss Wall Street expectations.
Global demand for smartphones has slowed in recent years. 
Thirty-three analysts recommend buying Microsoft's stock, with just one sell rating and one neutral, according to Refinitiv data. 
Twenty-five analysts have positive ratings on Apple, 16 are neutral and none recommend selling, the data show.

Analysts on average expect Microsoft's revenue to increase 12.7 percent for its fiscal year 2019 ending in June, compared with an estimated 5 percent rise for Apple's fiscal 2019, which ends in Sept, according to the Refinitiv data.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Website Nile Net Online promises Egyptians ""true news"" from its offices in the heart of Cairo's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), ""to expand the scope of freedom of expression in the Arab world.""
Its views on America do not chime with those of Egypt's state media, which celebrate Donald Trump's warm relations with Cairo. In one recent article, Nile Net Online derided the American president as a ""low-level theater actor"" who ""turned America into a laughing stock"" after he attacked Iran in a speech at the United Nations.
Until recently, Nile Net Online had more than 115,000 page-followers across Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Instagram. But its contact telephone numbers, including one listed as 0123456789, don't work. A Facebook map showing its location dropped a pin onto the middle of the street, rather than any building. And regulars at the square, including a newspaper stallholder and a policeman, say they have never heard of the website.
The reason: Nile Net Online is part of an influence operation based in Tehran.
It's one of more than 70 websites found by Reuters which push Iranian propaganda to 15 countries, in an operation that cybersecurity experts, social media firms and journalists are only starting to uncover. The sites found by Reuters are visited by more than half a million people a month, and have been promoted by social media accounts with more than a million followers.
The sites underline how political actors worldwide are increasingly circulating distorted or false information online to influence public opinion. The discoveries follow allegations that Russian disinformation campaigns have swayed voters in the United States and Europe. Advisers to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, and the army in Myanmar, are also among those using social media to distribute propaganda and attack their enemies. Moscow has denied the charges; Riyadh and Yangon have not commented.
Former CIA director John Brennan told Reuters that ""countries around the globe"" are now using such information warfare tactics.
""The Iranians are sophisticated cyber players,"" he said of the Iranian campaign. ""There are elements of the Iranian intelligence services that are rather capable in terms of operating (online).""
Traced by building on research from cybersecurity firms FireEye and ClearSky, the sites in the campaign have been active at different times since 2012. They look like normal news and media outlets, but only a couple disclose any Iranian ties.
Reuters could not determine whether the Iranian government is behind the sites; Iranian officials in Tehran and London did not reply to questions.
But all the sites are linked to Iran in one of two ways. Some carry stories, video and cartoons supplied by an online agency called the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM), which says on its website it is headquartered in Tehran. Some have shared online registration details with IUVM, such as addresses and phone numbers. Twenty-one of the websites do both.
Emails sent to IUVM bounced back and telephone numbers the agency gave in web registration records did not work. Documents available on the main IUVM website say its objectives include ""confronting with remarkable arrogance, western governments and Zionism front activities.""
Nile Net Online did not respond to questions sent to the email address on its website. Its operators, as well as those of the other websites identified by Reuters, could not be located. Previous owners identified in historical registration records could not be reached. The Egyptian government did not respond to requests for comment.

""UNSPOKEN TRUTH""
Some of the sites in the Iranian operation were first exposed in August by companies including Facebook, Twitter and Google's parent, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), after FireEye found them. The social media companies have closed hundreds of accounts that promoted the sites or pushed Iranian messaging. Facebook said last month it had taken down 82 pages, groups and accounts linked to the Iranian campaign; these had gathered more than one million followers in the United States and Britain.
But the sites uncovered by Reuters have a much wider scope. They have published in 16 different languages, from Azerbaijani to Urdu, targeting Internet users in less-developed countries. That they reached readers in tightly controlled societies such as Egypt, which has blocked hundreds of news websites since 2017, highlights the campaign's reach.
The Iranian sites include:
The news on the sites is not all fake. Authentic stories sit alongside pirated cartoons, as well as speeches from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sites clearly support Iran's government and amplify antagonism to countries opposed to Tehran - particularly Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Nile Net's ""laughing stock"" piece was copied from an Iranian state TV network article published earlier the same day.
Some of the sites are slapdash. The self-styled, misspelled ""Yemen Press Agecny"" carries a running update of Saudi ""crimes against Yemenis during the past 24 hours."" Emails sent to the agency's listed contact, Arafat Shoroh, bounced back. The agency's address and phone number led to a hotel in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, whose staff said they had never heard of Shoroh.
The identity or location of the past owners of some of the websites is visible in historical Internet registration records: 17 of 71 sites have in the past listed their locations as Iran or Tehran, or given an Iranian telephone or fax number. But who owns them now is often hidden, and none of the Iranian-linked operators could be reached.
More than 50 of the sites use American web service providers Cloudflare and OnlineNIC - firms that provide website owners with tools to shield themselves from spam and hackers. Frequently, such services also effectively conceal who owns the sites or where they are hosted. The companies declined to tell Reuters who operates the sites.
Under U.S law, hosting and web services companies are not generally liable for the content of sites they serve, said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. Still, since 2014, U.S. sanctions on Iran have banned ""the exportation or re-exportation, directly or indirectly, of web-hosting services that are for commercial endeavors or of domain name registration services.""
Douglas Kramer, general counsel for Cloudflare, said the services it provides do not include web-hosting services. ""We've looked at those various sanctions regimes, we are comfortable that we are not in violation,"" he told Reuters. 
A spokesman for OnlineNIC said none of the sites declared a connection to Iran in their registration details, and the company was in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and trade embargoes.
The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) declined to comment on whether it planned an investigation.
ANOTHER WESTERN DAWN
The Kremlin is widely seen as the superpower in modern information warfare. From what is known so far, Russia's influence operation - which Moscow denies - dwarfs Iran's. According to Twitter, nearly 4,000 accounts connected to the Russian campaign posted over 9 million tweets between 2013 and 2018, against over 1 million tweets from fewer than 1,000 accounts believed to originate in Iran.
Even though the Iranian operation is smaller, it has had impact on volatile topics. AWDnews - the site with the focus on ""unspoken truth"" - ran a false story in 2016 which prompted Pakistan's defense minister to warn on Twitter he had the weapons to nuke Israel. He only found out that the hoax was part of an Iranian operation when contacted by Reuters.
""It was a learning experience,"" said the deceived politician, 69-year-old Khawaja Asif, who left Pakistan's government earlier this year. ""But one can understand that these sorts of things happen, because fake news has become something huge. It's something which anyone is capable of now, which is very dangerous.""
Israeli officials did not respond to a request for comment.
AWDnews publishes in English, French, Spanish and German and, according to data from web analytics company SimilarWeb, receives around 12,000 unique visitors a month. Among others who shared stories from AWDnews and the other websites identified by Reuters were politicians in Britain, Jordan, India, and the Netherlands; human-rights activists; an Indian music composer and a Japanese rap star.
JOBS FOR WOMEN
FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, originally named six websites as part of the Iranian influence operation. Reuters examined those sites, and their content led to the Tehran-based International Union of Virtual Media.
IUVM is an array of 11 websites with names such as iuvmpress, iuvmapp and iuvmpixel. Together, they form a library of digital material, including mobile phone apps, items from Iranian state media and pictures, video clips and stories from elsewhere on the web, which support Tehran's policies.
Tracking usage of IUVM content across the Internet led to sites which have used its material, registration details, or both. For instance, 22 of the sites have shared the same phone number, which does not work and has also been listed for IUVM. At least seven have used the same address, which belongs to a youth hostel in Berlin. Staff at the hostel told Reuters they had never heard of the sites in question. The site operators could not be reached to explain their links with IUVM.
Two sites even posted job advertisements for IUVM, inviting applications from women with ""ability to work effectively and knowledge in dealing with social networks and (the) Internet.""
DEMOLISHED HOME
One of IUVM's most popular users is a site called Sudan Today, which SimilarWeb data shows receives almost 150,000 unique visitors each month. On Facebook, it tells its 57,000 followers that it operates without political bias. Its 18,000 followers on Twitter have included the Italian Embassy in Sudan, and its work has been cited in a report by the Egyptian Electricity Ministry.
The office address registered for Sudan Today in 2016 covers a whole city district in north Khartoum, according to archived website registration details provided by WhoisAPI Inc and DomainTools LLC. The phone number listed in those records does not work.
Reuters could not trace staff members named on Sudan Today's Facebook page. The five-star Corinthia hotel in central Khartoum, where the site says it hosted an anniversary party last year, told Reuters no such event took place. And an address listed on one of its social media accounts is a demolished home.
Sudan used to be an Iranian ally but has changed sides to align itself with Saudi Arabia, costing Tehran a foothold in the Horn of Africa just as it becomes more isolated by the West. In that environment, Iran sees itself as competing with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States for international support, and is taking the fight online, said Ariane Tabatabai, a senior associate and Iran expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. 
Headlines on Sudan Today's homepage include a daily round-up of stories from local newspapers and Ugandan soccer results. It also features reports on bread prices - which doubled in January after Khartoum eliminated subsidies, triggering demonstrations.
Ohad Zaidenberg, senior researcher at Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky, said this mixture of content provides the cover for narratives geared at influencing a target audience's attitudes and perceptions.
The site also draws attention to Saudi Arabia's military actions in Yemen. Since Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ended his allegiance with Iran he has sent troops and jets to join Saudi-led forces in the Yemeni conflict.
One cartoon from IUVM published by Sudan Today in August shows Donald Trump astride a military jet with an overflowing bag of dollar bills tucked under one arm. The jet is draped with traditional Saudi dress and shown dropping bombs on a bloodstained map of Yemen. The map is littered with children's toys and shoes.
Turkish cartoonist Mikail Çiftçi drew the original. He told Reuters he did not give Sudan Today permission to use it.
Alnagi Albashra, a 28-year-old software developer in Khartoum, said he likes to read articles on Sudan Today in the evenings when waiting for his baby to fall asleep. But he and three other Sudan Today readers reached by Reuters had no idea who was behind the site.
""This is a big problem,"" he said. ""You can't see that they are not in Sudan.""
Government officials in Khartoum, the White House, the Italian Embassy and the Egyptian Electricity Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
BACKBONE
It is unclear who globally is tasked with responding to online disinformation campaigns like Iran's, or what if any action they should take, said David Conrad, chief technology officer at ICANN, a non-profit which helps manage global web addresses.
Social media accounts can be deleted in bulk by the firms that provide the platforms. But the Iranian campaign's backbone of websites makes it harder to dismantle than social media, because taking down a website often requires the cooperation of law enforcement, Internet service providers and web infrastructure companies.
Efforts by social media companies in the United States and Europe to tackle the campaign have had mixed results. 
Shortly after being contacted by Reuters, Twitter suspended the accounts for Nile Net Online and Sudan Today. ""Clear attribution is very difficult,"" a spokeswoman said, but added that the company would continue to update a public database of tweets and accounts linked to state-backed information operations when it had new information. 
Google did not respond directly to questions about the websites found by Reuters. The company has said it identified and closed 99 accounts which it says are linked to Iranian state media. ""We've invested in robust systems to identify influence operations launched by foreign governments,"" a spokeswoman said.
Facebook said it was aware of the websites found by Reuters and had removed five more Facebook pages. But a spokesman said that based on Facebook user data, the company was not yet able to link all the websites' accounts to the Iranian activity found earlier. ""In the past several months, we have removed hundreds of Pages, Groups, and accounts linked to Iranian actors engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. We continue to remove accounts across our services and in all relevant languages,"" he said.
Accounts linked to the Iranian sites remain active online, especially in languages other than English. On Nov. 30, 16 of the Iranian sites were still posting daily updates on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube - including Sudan Today and Nile Net Online. Between them, the social media accounts had more than 700,000 followers.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",U.S. judge gives preliminary OK to $48 million Volkswagen investor settlement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in California has granted preliminary approval to a $48 million settlement for investors who said Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) made false and misleading statements over its excess diesel emissions.
Lawyers for the investors, who include police and other municipal pension funds, had estimated that the maximum they could have recovered was $147 million. But Judge Charles Breyer said the settlement agreed in August appeared ""fair, adequate and reasonable.""
VW, in a statement, said on Friday that the ""proposed settlement agreement eliminates the uncertainty and considerable costs of protracted litigation in the United States and is in the best interests of the company."" The ruling was issued late Wednesday.
In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buybacks will continue through 2019.
The German automaker admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. cars to cheat government exhaust emissions tests. The vehicles had emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollutants.
In 2017, VW also pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements in a U.S. court. Under the plea deal, the automaker agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years.
Federal prosecutors in Detroit unsealed criminal charges in May against former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn, who remains in Germany. Two other former VW executives have pleaded guilty in the investigation and are in prison. In total, nine people have been charged in the United States.

Breyer set a date for a fairness hearing to allow further comment on the August settlement for May 10, after which a final ruling will be issued.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Friday as investors hoped for progress on trade in a critical U.S.-China meeting over the weekend, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gains in nearly seven years.
The Dow saw its largest weekly advance in two years. Investors were encouraged this week by comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and subsequent minutes from the central bank's latest meeting that suggested that the Fed will take a data-driven rather than ideological approach to future rate-hikes.
All three major U.S. indexes recorded modest monthly percentage gains for November.
A Chinese official said ""consensus is steadily increasing"" in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China as the G20 meeting got underway in Buenos Aires, sparking hopes there would be a positive resolution in the ongoing tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies.
U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday and the outcome could swing stocks for the rest of the year.
""The three key issues that people are really focusing on are how dovish is the Fed going to be going forward, how are trade relations with China going to play out, and what's going on in the oil markets,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. 
""But as we get better news, that's helped lift the markets,"" Ripley added. ""That's why we're seeing a week like this week."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 199.62 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,538.46, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.4 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,760.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 57.45 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,330.54.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but energy (SPNY) ended the session in positive territory. 
Energy stocks fell 0.2 percent as crude prices (LCOc1) extended their slide.
But falling oil prices boosted airlines stocks. The Dow Jones Airlines index (DJUSAR) rose 2.8 percent.
Shares of Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) sank 5.6 percent after the hotel operator said hackers stole about 500 million records from its Starwood Hotels reservation system.
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) shares slid 5.5 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that former employees are being questioned by federal investigators about the company's failure to acknowledge its insurance business' worsening results over the years.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 90 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.39 billion shares, compared to the 7.63 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1533,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Clinches Monthly Gain Amid Late Rally on Trade Hopes,"Investing.com - The Dow delivered a late-stage rally Friday to clinch a monthly gain after a Chinese official reportedly suggested that the United States and China are making progress on trade, lifting investor hopes for a trade truce.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.79%. The S&P 500 rose 0.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.79%.
Reuters reported that a Chinese official said ""consensus is steadily increasing,"" in the U.S.-China trade talks. The official added, however, that ""differences between the two countries remained,"" according to the report.
The positive remarks arrived just hours before President Donald Trump said ""something could very well come out"" of his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, slated to take place on the sidelines of the G20 summit, which got underway Friday.
But there remains some reason for caution as Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who is hawkish on trade with Beijing, will attend the Saturday dinner meeting between the two nations.
Still, the positive soundbites underpinned trade-sensitive stocks, pushing the broader market higher.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), trade bellwethers because of their international exposure, closed higher, with the latter posting a gain of more than 4%.
Energy names kept lid on gains in the broader market, however, on the back of falling oil prices, even as Bloomberg reported that OPEC's advisory committee suggested cutting production by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) from last month's levels.
Financials shrugged off weakness in Goldman Sachs to close higher, helped by a rally in SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) after Barclays upgraded its rating on the stock to overweight a day earlier.
Bank of America cut its rating on Goldman Sachs to neutral from buy and lowered its price target on the stock to $225 on worries that the bank could potentially face a hefty fine for its role in arranging billions of dollars of deals for state fund 1MDB. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) fell more than 2%.
Prosecutors alleged that two former Goldman bankers and a Malaysian associate stole more than $2 billion from 1MDB and paid bribes to foreign officials to secure business for the Wall Street bank, potentially violating U.S. laws.
On the corporate earnings front, GameStop's (NYSE:GME) above-forecast third-quarter earnings and revenue results were overshadowed by lower full-year guidance, sending its shares more than 6% lower.
And Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) rallied 10% after the company managed to beat guidance for a fourth-straight year.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>",GM's CEO to meet U.S. lawmakers next week over job cuts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra plans to visit Capitol Hill next week to discuss its plans to halt production at five plants in North America next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs, two congressional aides said on Friday.
GM has come under harsh criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties, and from President Donald Trump, since Monday when the No. 1 U.S. automaker announced the biggest restructuring since its bankruptcy a decade ago.
Barra is expected to meet with lawmakers from Michigan and Ohio, where GM plans to shutter three plants, as well as senior leaders in Congress. GM did not immediately comment.
Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, told CNN earlier this week that GM had done what others could not -- uniting both parties in their anger. She added that GM ""has to be the most thoroughly disliked company in Washington DC right now."" She also criticized GM's handling of the layoffs.
GM said this week that many workers at plants that are ending production will be able to transfer to open jobs at other plants.
Barra has been calling lawmakers this week to explain the decision to end production. Trump has threatened to revoke subsidies for GM for electric vehicles.
Barra also will speak at a forum next week at Harvard University in Massachusetts for new incoming members of Congress.
GM plans to halt production next year at three assembly plants: the Lordstown small-car factory near Youngstown, Ohio; the Detroit-Hamtramck complex in Detroit; and the Oshawa, Ontario, assembly complex near Toronto. It will also stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse.
Additionally, GM plans to shutter the Warren transmission plant outside Detroit and a plant that makes electric motors and drivetrains outside Baltimore, Maryland.
GM could opt to add additional new products to those plants at a later date after it holds contract talks next summer with the United Auto Workers union.

Cost pressures on GM and other automakers and suppliers have increased as demand has waned for traditional sedans. The company has said tariffs on imported steel, imposed earlier this year by the Trump administration, have cost it $1 billion.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 01:45PM ET</span>",Police search offices of Deutsche Bank board members,"By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Police have searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) board as part of an investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers, a source told Reuters on Friday.
Shares in Germany's largest bank ended 2.9 percent lower, after hitting a record low earlier in the day, as a raid that began on Thursday at the bank's towering Frankfurt headquarters extended into a second day.
""We will of course continue to actively support the investigation and work constructively with the authorities,"" Karl von Rohr, Deutsche's co-deputy chief executive officer, said in a statement on Friday evening.
 Deutsche Bank  shares have lost around half of their value this year, after the bank endured three years of losses and a series of financial and regulatory scandals. The company is now worth only around 17 billion euros ($19.3 billion).
The raid comes as Deutsche Bank tries to repair its tattered reputation.
Christian Sewing, appointed chief executive in April to help the bank rebuild, has trimmed the group's U.S. operations and reshuffled its management board, but revenue has continued to slip.
Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor's office has said. The inquiries focus on events from 2013 to this year.
Gerhard Schick, a member of parliament for the opposition Green party, said it was ""particularly irritating"" that the bank's current board members oversaw operations during the time in question. ""This is not about legacy issues,"" he said in a statement to Reuters.
BOARD MEETING
This week's events raise the stakes of a regularly scheduled meeting of the bank's supervisory board planned for Dec. 4. 
The prosecutor said on Thursday the investigation had been triggered after investigators reviewed information in the Panama Papers, consisting of millions of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca leaked to the media in April 2016.
Around 170 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors began the raid on Thursday, seizing written and electronic documents. Only one police car was visible outside the bank's headquarters early on Friday. 
The head of the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, Albrecht Schreiber, said on Friday evening that investigators had made ""very rapid and very good progress"". Deutsche was cooperating fully, he said, adding that authorities' queries were answered ""without reservation"".
Deutsche Bank's controls that aim to prevent money laundering have caught the attention of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Schick, who is also chairman of Finanzwende, a grassroots financial watchdog initiative, pointed the finger at Germany's financial market regulator, BaFin.
BaFin said its critics had misunderstood the situation, and that supervisors and prosecutors played different roles.
In January, BaFin president Felix Hufeld said the agency had found no evidence of substantial breaches of money laundering rules by the banks named in the Panama Papers.
In September, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and ""terrorist financing,"" and appointed KPMG as third party to assess progress.

On Thursday, as the raids were going on, the vice chairman of supervision for the U.S. Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles, met Deutsche Bank management for an unrelated and previously scheduled appointment at the bank's headquarters, a spokesman for the Fed said. ($1 = 0.8805 euros)

GameStop's (NYSE:GME) above-forecast third-quarter earnings and revenue results were overshadowed by lower full-year guidance, sending its shares more than 5% lower.
GameStop forecasts full-year earnings in the range of $2.55 to $2.75, below both consensus of $3.04 a share and prior guidance of $3 to $3.35 a share, suggesting the video game retailer is struggling to win against a shift to digital purchases.
NPD Group, an American market research company, said Friday mobile games and digital content for console and portable platforms were experiencing the most growth in 2018.
GameStop blamed the weaker sales on subdued performance by Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) ""Call of Duty"" and sports titles. Activision fell more than 4%.
Rival game developer  Take-Two Interactive  (NASDAQ:TTWO) was down 1% as downside was limited by news that the company could, in the future, venture into into other areas of the entertainment business beyond gaming, even as its blockbuster video game ""Red Redemption 2"" has racked up impressive sales since launch.
The company sold 17 million units of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" in just eight days since launch, Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of the Rockstar Games parent, told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an interview."

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>",Swiss announce plan to block Swiss share trades on EU exchanges,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government announced plans on Friday to ban trading of Swiss shares on European Union stock exchanges from January, in an escalating row with Brussels that could put a severe dent in cross-border stock trading.
Frustrated by a lack of progress on a new bilateral treaty, Brussels has said that as of Dec 31 it will withdraw its recognition of Swiss stock market regulations that allows EU-based investors to trade in Switzerland.
In a tit-for-tat response, the Swiss government said in June it could ban by decree trading of Swiss shares on exchanges in the EU. Around 30 percent of the volume of trade in Swiss shares is now carried out on other platforms including CBOE Europe, Turquoise and Aquis.
Finance Minister Ueli Maurer has said failure to act could make bourse trading volume collapse by 70 to 80 percent. 
The ordinance it unveiled on Friday puts that plan into effect, unless the European Commission recognizes Swiss regulatory equivalence by the start of next year.
""The government's aim and the best solution for all affected market players in Switzerland and abroad remains a swift and unlimited extension of stock market equivalence,"" it said.
Heavyweights like Nestle (S:NESN),  Novartis  (S:NOVN), Roche (S:ROG), UBS (S:UBSG) and Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN) make the SIX Swiss Exchange the fourth-largest in Europe with listed companies worth around $1.6 trillion. 
Trading turnover was 1.35 trillion Swiss francs ($1.35 trillion) last year.
The Swiss government ordinance requires foreign trading venues to get Swiss recognition for trading Swiss shares. EU trading venues would not qualify, but other venues like New York, Singapore or Hong Kong would.
Swiss officials hope this would encourage more trading of Swiss stocks in Switzerland.
Swiss bourse operator SIX, which welcomed the government's move, risks losing much of its exchange business if the European Union and Switzerland fail to reach a deal by the end of the year on future relations, SIX's chairman told Reuters in September.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","PVH plans fixes for Calvin Klein, sees strong start to holidays","(Reuters) - PVH Corp (N:PVH) on Friday allayed investor concerns over its Calvin Klein business and said early holiday sales were above its expectations, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent.
Shares fell 8 percent in extended trade on Thursday after a weakness in the high-end brand in the third quarter led the company to report its first revenue miss in at least two years.
""We went too far, too fast on both fashion and price,"" Chief Executive Officer Emanuel Chirico said on a post-earnings call on Friday. 
""We're working on fixing this fashion miss, and we believe that our CK Jeans offering will be much more commercial and fashion-right beginning in 2019,"" Chirico said.
The company will also reevaluate spending on Calvin Klein's 205W39NYC line to improve profit margins in 2019.
Management appears to not only have a better understanding of the driver behind Calvin Klein's weakness but has executed clear fixes to self-inflicted missteps of the past, J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew Boss said in a note.
Chirico said the company was seeing strong sales at key brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger in North America since the start of the holiday season. 
""Given commentary that includes accelerating Q4-to-date results and a plan in place to improve Calvin Klein operating margins in FY19, we are taking this opportunity to get incrementally more constructive on the stock,"" said C.L. King & Associates' analyst Steven Marotta, who upgraded his rating to ""strong buy"" from ""buy"".
PVH forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 to $1.60 per share, in line with analysts' expectation, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company also flagged sluggish consumer traffic in China in the third quarter, compared with the first two quarters, due to a softening economy and an escalating trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
""We're still moving but the traffic levels in the store are not what they were in Spring season,"" Chirico said.
PVH said it expected $75 million increase in cost of goods if the proposal to raise tariffs to 25 percent is implemented.

""It's not insignificant,"" Chirico said, adding that if the raised tariffs are implemented on Jan. 1 there would be ""no time to react"".

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 11:32AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Vodafone, Liberty Global deal faces full EU antitrust scrutiny - source","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vodafone's (L:VOD) $21.8 billion proposed acquisition of Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) assets in Germany and eastern Europe is likely to face a full EU antitrust investigation, a person familiar with the matter said.
The European Commission's move could ratchet up pressure on the world's second-largest mobile operator to offer concessions, unless it can convince the EU competition enforcer that the deal poses no competition issues.
Investors and industry players, however, will be hoping for a flexible regulatory stance given that the Commission has just given unconditional clearance for Deutsche Telekom's (DE:DTEGn) acquisition of Tele2's (ST:TEL2b) Dutch business after initial concerns.
The deal between  Vodafone  and U.S. cable pioneer John Malone's Liberty would enable Vodafone to better compete with Deutsche Telekom in the German rival's home market.
The enlarged company would be Europe's biggest provider of broadband, cable and mobile services with 54 million customers and reach 110 million homes and businesses. The acquisition includes Liberty Global assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.
Deutsche Telekom has criticized the deal while  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) and the BREKO business group, which represents German broadband providers, have urged the EU to block the takeover because it would hurt competition.
The opening of a so-called in-depth investigation would in practical terms mean the European Commission's rejection of a request by the German cartel authority to take over the case - a request that had been welcomed by Deutsche Telekom. The Commission may see the deal in a broader EU-wide perspective, which could benefit Vodafone.

The Commission, which is scheduled to wrap up its preliminary review by Dec. 11, and Vodafone declined to comment. Liberty Global said: ""We are in constructive discussions with the European Commission and are confident of a positive outcome in due course.""

The company, which makes everything from aircraft engines to catalysts used in petroleum refining, is currently based in Morris Plains, New Jersey.
Honeywell will also relocate the headquarters of its safety and productivity solutions (SPS) business unit to Charlotte from Fort Mill, South Carolina.
The SPS unit makes supply chain and warehouse automation equipment, software and personal protection equipment, especially footwear designed for workers.
""Charlotte is a top-10 destination city in the U.S. that will readily enable us to recruit and retain the world-class talent we will need over the long term,"" Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk said.
Honeywell will relocate about 150 to 200 New Jersey-based senior management positions and about 100 South Carolina-based employees to Charlotte between now and September 2019, the company said.
The company plans to gradually add about 500 corporate and SPS employees to the Charlotte location over the next five years, taking the total employment to about 750 at the new location by the end of 2024.

About 1,000 Honeywell employees will remain within the company's six locations in New Jersey.

The international oil company has a limited presence in the Middle East, where some of the world's biggest oil and gas reserves lie, producing more than half its output in Africa.
""Eni is in talks with Oman for various opportunities,"" the source told Reuters, adding recent geopolitical tensions in the area had not curbed its interest.
Last year Eni sealed its first deal in Oman, winning a majority stake in offshore acreage and selling on part to Qatar Petroleum. 
This year it took a first step into Abu Dhabi, paying $875 million for stakes in two oil concessions and then buying part of the giant Ghasa gas field from state oil group Adnoc.
The source said Eni had submitted an expression of interest for a minority stake in Adnoc's refinery business, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
Abu Dhabi has put on sale 40 percent of Adnoc's refining unit valued at $8 billion but will never sell to a single company, the source said, adding many others were interested including Chinese and Indian firms and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF).
""Eni is also interested in other downstream opportunities,"" the source said, pointing to Adnoc's ambitions in that area.
Last year Adnoc presented a 2030 strategy plan to open up its energy markets to foreign operators and attract the skills needed to develop E&P, refining and petrochemical industries.
Thanks to bumper gas discoveries in Mozambique's Mamba field and Egypt's Zohr, Eni has one of the strongest discovery records in the industry and one of the fastest time to market records.
""Getting into refining would give Eni a natural hedge to all its upstream business as well as allowing it to diversify away from Africa,"" said Santander (MC:SAN) oil analyst Jason Kenney.

Sources have also told Reuters Eni is in the race to get into Qatar's plans to expand its liquefied natural gas industry, saying teaming up with Qatar Petroleum in Mexico was a preparatory move.

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Equities Strategist on Target for 2018 Sees ‘Final Push Higher’ to End Year,"(Bloomberg) -- The stage is set for a year-end equity rally, according to Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Market Strategist Peter Cecchini.
Cecchini for months has had a year-end 2018 S&P 500 Index target of 2,805, one of the more bearish among Wall Street strategists and just 2.5 percent above the index’s close Thursday. Earlier this month, he said markets may have gotten overextended. He now sees technicals, normalization of the VIX futures curve and declining correlations as factors helping support gains into the end of 2018.
“Major U.S. stock indices may now be poised for a rally into year-end on any lack of bad news,” Cecchini wrote in a note late Thursday. “We might expect a final push higher, as has been the case in 2007 and 2000,” before the S&P 500 violates a monthly technicals trend higher.
Cecchini said he’s going to be watching technology stocks for clues, and will be keying on FAANG shares in particular “to assess the duration of this bounce, but we’re not looking for a sustained advance.”
While he does expect a rally, it’s getting close to the time for hedging, Cecchini said. It’s a bit too early, “if push came to shove, we’d buy Russell 2000 volatility over S&P volatility.”
Crude oil is oversold, Cecchini said, recommending purchase of United State Oil Fund LP (ticker: USO (NYSE:USO)) call options to bet on a comeback. He also said high-yield credit should correlate with equities on the bounce.
This may all be the calm before the storm, though. Cecchini said his 2019 view “is becoming considerably more bearish.” He continues to expect more volatility in stocks and in risk assets generally on tighter global monetary policy conditions.
On top of that, the yield curve “is an equity story not only for banks but also for the broader market, as we feel it (in combination with other factors) is signaling a growth slowdown in 2019 and potentially a recession in late 2019,” Cecchini said."
1593,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>","Don't undermine EU trade stance, Merkel ally warns German car chiefs","BERLIN (Reuters) - A top ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel warned German car bosses on Friday not to undermine the European Union's united negotiating stance on U.S. trade tariffs when they meet senior officials in Washington next week.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is leading the race to succeed Merkel as head of the Christian Democratic Union, said she was concerned about plans by top executives from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) to meet at the White House on trade policy.
""In the past, it has only been possible to avert punitive tariffs when we maintained a clear and strong position, for instance as the European Union,"" she told Reuters. ""Given that, one must take care not to undermine such a strong, united political position through bilateral discussions.""
President Donald Trump has lambasted German automakers and what he sees as an unfair trade imbalance in the sector. He has threatened for months to impose tariffs on vehicles assembled in the EU, a move that could upend the industry's business model for selling cars in the United States.
The German chancellery said on Friday it was aware of the idea of a meeting between the car bosses and U.S. officials, and stressed that the European Commission was responsible for negotiating with the U.S. administration on trade and tariffs.
Executives from the German car companies are finalizing plans for the meeting at the invitation of the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell.
U.S.-based officials from the carmakers, asking not to be named, said a meeting was tentatively set for Tuesday, and would include VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and BMW production chief Oliver Zipse. 
The CEOs plan to make clear they cannot negotiate on behalf of the EU, people close to the matter said last week.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are expected to join the meeting, although this has yet to be confirmed.
While Trump has thus far refrained from imposing tariffs, U.S. officials have grown frustrated about the slow pace of progress on solving U.S.-EU trade disputes.
Grenell told an event sponsored by AmCham Germany that he was optimistic a solution could be found.
""Yes it is true, we are trying to solve the car issue,"" Grenell said. ""I am very hopeful,"" he said. It was not immediately clear if Grenell would attend the meeting.

The United States currently imposes import tariffs on cars assembled in the EU of 2.5 percent, compared with 10 percent tariffs for U.S.-built cars entering the European trading bloc.

TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will discuss the Renault-Nissan alliance's future with Japan's prime minister at the G20 summit in Argentina on Friday, seeking to defuse a brewing diplomatic row over the balance of power inside the partnership.
The auto alliance is facing the biggest test of its 19-year existence after the ousting of Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was arrested last week for suspected financial misconduct.
Tokyo authorities on Friday approved the maximum 10-day extension of Ghosn's detention, Japanese media said. Prosecutors have to file charges against Ghosn, 64, by Dec. 10 or arrest him on suspicion of fresh crimes to keep him in custody. 
Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment. Nissan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ghosn's detention in Tokyo has left the Franco-Japanese auto alliance without its leader and main interlocutor with the French government, which owns 15 percent of  Renault  and wants to maintain the current alliance capital structure.
Renault (PA:RENA) controls Nissan through its 43.4 percent stake, while Nissan holds a reciprocal non-voting 15 percent stake in its French partner.
BUENOS AIRES MEETING
An official in the French presidency said Macron would discuss the alliance with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at midday in Buenos Aires, but gave no further details.
Meeting in Paris last week, Japanese Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reaffirmed the two countries' support for the alliance. 
A few days later, however, Le Maire said on French television that he and Seko had agreed that keeping the alliance's current capital structure was desirable - an agreement the Japanese minister denied making.
The Mainichi Shimbun daily reported on Friday that Seko had sent a rare letter of protest to Le Maire for the remarks.
Officials at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said they could not immediately comment on the letter. A French finance ministry official said Le Maire's office had no comment.
Le Maire's apparent faux pas drew some criticism from Renault staff representatives concerned for the alliance.
""The government should know their place and stay there,"" said a union official at the French carmaker. ""This kind of overreaching may be counter-productive.""
Ghosn's arrest, including for allegedly under-reporting his income, has triggered new attempts by Nissan to shake off what it considers Renault's outsized control of it, adding to problems at Macron's Elysee.
As economy minister, Macron had masterminded the French government's surprise increase of its Renault stake in 2015, raising alarm bells inside Nissan that the Elysee was out to wield more influence over the Japanese company. 
The auto alliance, which also includes Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), for its part ""emphatically reiterated"" its commitment to the partnership on Thursday after executives met in Amsterdam for the first time since Ghosn's arrest.

A review of the capital structure was not discussed at the meeting, Mitsubishi Motors' CEO Osamu Masuko said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest banks are plowing ahead with plans to set up a new dispute resolution system for small firms wronged by lenders, despite opposition from lawmakers who say the planned remedies are too weak.
UK Finance, a City trade body, said seven banks including RBS (L:RBS), Lloyds (L:LLOY) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) would set up and fund a complaints service capable of resolving disputes and paying awards of up to 600,000 pounds.
Lawmakers and victims of bank mistreatment have been lobbying for better access to justice following a string of scandals involving past mistreatment of struggling firms by lenders, including RBS and HBOS, now part of Lloyds.
Small complaints are currently handled by the Financial Ombudsman Service, but campaigners and a number of senior lawmakers favor setting up a new tribunal system for disputes outside the body's limited remit, with stronger powers to sanction and compel evidence from lenders.
However, the government has shown little appetite for backing the legislation needed to establish such a system.
John Glen, the City minister, welcomed UK Finance's plans, saying it was ""a big step in the right direction"". 
Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond has previously said he believes the ombudsman service was a better way to go, arguing it would be faster and at a lower cost than a tribunal.
The new voluntary ombudsman will be available to companies with a turnover of between 6.5 million and 10 million pounds, with firms under the threshold able to access an expanded dispute service planned at FOS.
The lenders – which also include HSBC , Santander UK (MC:SAN), CYBG (L:CYBGC) and Danske – have also agreed to set up a separate ombudsman to review cases stretching back to the financial crisis in 2008, which will be able to award payouts of up to 350,000 pounds.
An earlier independent review commissioned by UK Finance had recommended these actions.
UK Finance Chief Executive Stephen Jones said the plans would help ""in restoring trust between [small firms] and the financial industry.""
But lawmaker Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the cross-party group for fair business banking, hit back, saying the caps on payouts were too low and the overall system would leave many firms with no option but to pursue costly court action.

""This will still leave the courts as the only way for some victims of banking misconduct to access justice, but it is virtually impossible for most people to sue a bank,"" he said.

Jewelry has been one of the best performing corners of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the 18 billion euro global market were set to progress 7 percent this year. 
That puts growth on a par with footwear, and above high-margin categories like handbags where fashion groups such as Gucci tend to make most of their money. 
Most labels produce earrings and other accessories but high-end jewelry is a more rarefied world, occupied by the likes of Switzerland's Chopard, or Boucheron, a label owned by Kering into which it is also plowing resources. 
""The two hundred pieces, with many colored gemstones, will be made in Italy,"" Kering's Chairman and CEO Pinault said in an interview with France's Le Figaro. 
Kering confirmed the launch at Gucci but did not immediately provide further details. 
Gucci has been one of the fastest growing luxury brands in recent years, thanks to a flamboyant makeover under designer Alessandro Michele. That has raised questions over how long its boom can last, and the brand has already been beefing up new lines in homeware and beauty products. 
Overall revenue at Kering reached 3.4 billion euros ($3.90 billion) in the third quarter, up a better-than-expected 27.5 percent on a comparable basis thanks largely to the thriving sales at Gucci. 

Pinault also said in the interview that Kering aimed to use ethically-sourced gold for all its jewels in two years' time, up from 70 percent now.

""However, given the more appealing valuations and the fact that most of the bond yield repricing is behind us, there will be room to increase risk-taking in some areas of the market.""
European fund managers warmed to U.S. assets in both the fixed income and equities space. Within bond portfolios, those gains came at the expense of euro zone securities.
Fund managers also nearly doubled holdings of British bonds to 5.8 percent from 2.9 percent as an escalation in Brexit noise and the growth hit associated with Britain's exit from the European Union made debt more attractive.
Ten-year British government bond yields fell around 10 basis points over the month (GB10YT=RR).
Across equity portfolios, European asset managers raised not only U.S. but also emerging Europe and Latin America holdings, with the latter at levels last seen in May. That came at the expense of positions in the euro zone, Britain and Asia including Japan.
British blue chips (FTSE) have lost about 2 percent in November, which compares with a retreat of roughly 1.5 percent for euro zone companies (STOXXE) as global markets fail to rebound from a hefty correction in October. 
Fund managers were split on whether the ECB would be forced to shelve plans to hike interest rates next year. Exactly half of the respondents predicted policymakers would plow ahead and deliver the bloc's first rate hike since 2011 in the face of slowing growth. 
Latest numbers from the euro zone showed the bloc's economy grew at its slowest pace in four years in the third quarter. But some predicted this could change. 
""After a disappointing 2018 euro area economic momentum should rebound into positive territory in 2019,"" said Jan Bopp, investment strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin. 

""Therefore, recent disappointing data should not alter ECB's normalisation plans.""

1603,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Leveraged Loan Market Is Showing Signs of Sputtering,"(Bloomberg) -- The best-performing U.S. corporate debt market is showing a few cracks.
A $6.5 billion loan that helped finance the leveraged buyout of a Thomson Reuters Corp. unit is quoted at around 97.25 cents on the dollar, after being sold for just shy of 100 cents. The $5.05 billion of loans for KKR & Co.’s buyout of Envision Healthcare are now quoted at about 96.125 cents on the dollar, around two months after being issued at 99.75 cents.
These debts have weakened with the broader leveraged loan market, which on average is priced at its lowest level since 2016. And there are other signs of cooling in loans too: the percentage of new deals that had to increase pricing spiked earlier this month to the highest of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Loan offerings are getting pulled at the fastest rate since July. And U.S. leveraged loan funds are seeing some of their biggest outflows in nearly three years.
It’s hardly a loanpocalypse. Plenty of new issues are still getting sold in the more than $1 trillion market, and the debt has gained about 3.1% this year including interest, performing better than U.S. junk bonds and investment-grade notes. Loan prices often fall toward the end of the year, as money managers grow reluctant to take risk and buy new loans. Any current weakness may disappear in the new year. And investment-grade corporate debt is showing signs of stabilizing.
But recent loan price declines have been higher than usual and markets from equities to oil have been weakening since October. Some members of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s key monetary policy setting body, have expressed concern about ""the high level of leveraged loans"" and overall corporate borrowing.
The difficulty in lending markets underscores that even the relatively safe corners of credit -- loans are insulated from interest-rate hikes and are first in line to be repaid when a company fails -- can suffer when money managers get worried. Companies hoping to tap the loan market to cut their borrowing costs and gain more time to pay off debt are realizing that now might not be the best time to borrow.
""People are generally avoiding risk and there’s no need to chase new issues,"" said Michael Nechamkin, co-chief investment officer at Octagon Credit Investors, which has $20 billion in assets.
‘Upper Hand’
At least five loan offerings have been pulled in November, including deals from Sorenson Communications, which makes videophones for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, and Perimeter Solutions, a chemicals company. The borrowers that are pulling back tend to be those that don’t absolutely need the financing -- perhaps they were looking to refinance debt amid a hot market but were surprised at how much they would have to end up paying.
Jason Inc., for example, was looking to extend maturities on loans maturing in 2021 and 2022. After pulling its deal, the manufacturer still has ample time to handle those obligations.
There’s more evidence that investors are gaining the upper hand in the loan market. The main U.S. leveraged loan price index fell below 97 cents on the dollar this week, the lowest level since the end of 2016. It’s been falling since October, when it topped 98.5 cents.
And last week, eight loans that companies were issuing ended up paying more interest than the borrowers had anticipated, while none ended up paying less. There hasn’t been a week where no offerings tightened since at least August.
""The lenders generally have the upper hand now and can extract better terms,"" said Frank Ossino, senior managing director at Newfleet Asset Management, which has $11.4 billion in assets under management.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>",UK funds cut equity holdings to 13-month low after autumn turbulence: Reuters Poll,"By Sujata Rao
(Reuters) - UK-based funds cut equity holdings to a 13-month low in November, amid mounting fears of a slowdown in U.S. and world growth, but allocations to British stocks and bonds rose modestly despite an escalation in Brexit noise.
Reuters' latest asset allocation survey conducted between Nov. 15-29 showed overall equity allocations slipped to 50 percent in global portfolios, down a fraction from last month but almost 5 percentage points down from January levels.
That comes after a torrid October that saw U.S. and world stocks both lose around 7 percent (SPX) (MIWD00000PUS) and while markets bounced in November, positioning likely reflects unease on growth and global trade before U.S. President Donald Trump meets China's Xi Jinping at a G20 summit.
""My expectation is that a meaningful correction will begin in the second half of 2019 which will eventually morph into a bear market in early 2020,"" Thomas McDonald at Russell Investments said.
In response to a special question on what would be best performing asset class of 2019, almost 60 percent of those who replied picked Asian and emerging equities, citing their weakness this year and cheap valuations.
That was reflected in positioning too, with allocation to non-Japan Asian stocks rising to 10.2 percent, the highest since May and up 1.5 percentage points from October.
Less than a third of respondents picked U.S. equities and tech stocks, which have been hit in recent weeks by doubts on earnings and growth momentum, issues that many reckon could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause its rate-hike cycle.
Doubts are growing also about the European Central Bank's ability to raise interest rates in 2019. Poll participants who replied to a special question were almost equally divided on the subject but Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, pointed to rising wage pressures.
""A gradual pick up in underlying price pressures should encourage the ECB to take baby-steps, and we anticipate the central bank raising interest rates in December 2019,"" he added.
The poll was held as British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a deal with European Union authorities on exiting the bloc in March 2019. While economists, including the Bank of England, warn of a huge economic hit in event of a ""no-deal Brexit"", the deal could be rejected by parliament.
The newsflow has caused wild swings in sterling but it is flat in November, having fallen in six of the past seven months. Investors raised holdings of British stocks to 22.25 percent, from last month's 20.8 percent, while bond allocations rose 2.5 percentage points to 16.5 percent.
However, holdings of British stocks and bonds have fallen sharply from January levels.

A question about fair value for sterling in event of a no-deal Brexit yielded a wide range of views. But around half of those who replied predicted it to trade between parity to the dollar to $1.10, versus current levels around $1.28 .

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>",Global funds raise cash holdings to 20-month high as caution mounts,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Concerned about the health of the global economy, international investors boosted allocations to safe-haven cash in November to the highest levels in almost two years, while further trimming equity exposure, especially in the United States.
Following a brutal October, world stocks bounced in early November but ceded those gains later in the month as tech stocks were routed and oil prices tumbled. November was the worst month for iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL) and for Brent crude futures (LCOc1) since the 2008 financial crisis.
Ructions in the run-up to Britain's March 2019 departure from the European Union, Italy's budget-linked standoff with EU authorities and U.S.-China tensions over trade are also pressuring markets and threatening to slow world growth. 
Fund managers around the globe reduced their exposure to equities to 47.7 percent from 47.9 percent in October - the lowest level since July, according to Reuters' monthly asset-allocation poll of 47 asset managers conducted on Nov. 15-29. 
Fixed income holdings rose to 39.3 percent, a touch higher than October, while cash levels - a key gauge of investor caution - rose to a 20-month high of 5.6 percent. Cash holdings have risen almost 2 percentage points since the start of 2018.
""After a bounceback, equity markets slipped again in November as growth concerns remain, and so do political uncertainties,"" said Cédric Baron, from the multi asset strategies team at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners. 
Economic slowdown in the United States and China, the world's top two economies, ranked high on the risk list of investors. All eyes now are on this weekend's meeting of the G20 bloc of nations' leaders, especially on a high-stakes encounter between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
""This meeting should set the tone for risky assets until the end of the year,"" Baron added.
Across equity portfolios, fund managers cut back on U.S. stocks after holdings hit the highest level in at least five years in September. Holdings of euro zone and Japanese equities also fell as fund managers shifted into stocks in emerging Asia and Britain. 
Fixed income allocations mirrored some of that geographic pattern, with holdings of U.S. and euro zone bonds reduced in favor of British and Japanese debt. 
While U.S. and European government bonds have held up well over the past month, corporate bonds have come under pressure as investors are concerned over economic growth and the impending end of bond purchases by the European Central Bank. 
Corporate bonds across the bloc sold off sharply in November, with the average yield on European cooperate debt rising to 2-1/2 year highs. <.IBBEU003D>
""Global bond markets have been influenced by all of the variables surrounding central bank policies, in the U.S. the Fed seem to be stalling,"" said Peter Lowman, CIO at Investment Quorum. 
Data has confirmed U.S. economic growth slowed in the third quarter, with momentum likely moderating further early in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile numbers from the euro zone showed the bloc's economy grew at its slowest pace in four years in the third quarter.
Fund managers were undecided if the ECB will be forced to shelve ambitions to hike interest rates next year. Around 55 percent expect no increase in 2019, while 45 percent predict policy makers will plough ahead and deliver the bloc's first rate hike since 2011.
Looking ahead to 2019, many fund managers forecast emerging market equities could be in for a rebound. 

The sector has been hammered in 2018, due to rising U.S. interest rates and crises in Turkey and Argentina. MSCI's emerging stock market index (MSCIEF) have tumbled more than 14 percent since the start of the year.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",IKEA targets big cut in greenhouse gas emissions from production,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA, the world's biggest furniture group, pledged on Friday to cut greenhouse gas emissions from its production by 80 percent in absolute terms by 2030 from their levels two years ago.
The commitment applies to IKEA's own factories and most of its direct suppliers, brand owner Inter IKEA said in a statement.
It comes days before world leaders gather in Katowice, Poland for the most important U.N. climate meeting since the 2015 Paris summit, where 195 countries pledged to work to limit a rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius.
""I hope for a leadership that steps up, sets clear targets and dares to nail a number of commitments without us having all the solutions,"" Inter IKEA CEO Torbjorn Loof told Reuters. 
""That goes for governments, businesses and other players,"" he said, adding it was vital that emission targets are set in absolute terms. 
The U.N. on Thursday warned global temperatures are on course for a 3-5C rise this century.
In 2016, IKEA's direct suppliers and own factories emitted 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. IKEA produces around 10 percent of its range itself and sources the rest from suppliers.
Efficiency across production and shifts to renewable energy, such as biomass-based for the energy-intensive particle-board production, will help reach the new target, CEO Loof and sustainability chief Lena Pripp-Kovac said in an interview.
Other key elements are a shift towards more lightweight materials, and tests of a new glue, a switch to which could cut as much as 6 percent off its emissions level. 

More than 400 firms including H&M, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Sony have committed to a U.N.-backed initiative to help limit global warming to below 2C.

The S&P 500 futures fell 11 points or 0.43% to 2,732.25 as of 6:40 AM ET (11:40 GMT) while Dow futures dipped 126 points, or 0.50%, to 25,266.0. Meanwhile tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures decreased 31 points, or 0.46%, to 6,881.75.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, which kicks off later in the day.
The market was briefly encouraged by Trump’s comments on Thursday that he was close to doing “something” on trade with China, although he added that he wasn’t sure he wanted to.
Meanwhile, Fed meeting minutes released on Thursday showed the central bank is expecting to hike interest rates in December but future rate hikes would be dependent on data, making predictions more dicey.
The minutes were released a day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the current level of rates is “just below” neutral, which investors read as a sign that the pace of further hikes might be slower.
Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) was among the top gainers in pre-market trading, rising 2.82% after the software company beat estimates for the fourth year in a row.
 Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) gained 1.70% after NBA’s player Steph Curry asked the company to market his signature basketball shoes to girls after a nine-year-old girl wrote to him asking for the shoes.
Elsewhere, GameStop (NYSE:GME) slumped 12% after the company slashed its full-year profit outlook, while  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) fell 3.65% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) inched down 0.43%.
In other commodities, gold futures declined 0.23% to $1,227.60 a troy ounce while crude oil futures decreased 1.38% to $50.74 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.15% to 96.84."

Shanghai-listed Huatai Securities, which counts  Alibaba  (K:BABA) as a strategic investor, said in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it has been given the green light by China's securities watchdog to issue global depository receipts (GDR) at the London Stock Exchange. 
Huatai didn't give a fundraising target on Friday, but it has previously said it aims to raise at least $500 million. 
The go-ahead from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) would mark the launch of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect, which would allow companies publicly traded in Shanghai and London to list on each other's bourses via the issuance of depository receipts (DRs).
""The program offers us access to one of the deepest and most influential capital markets in the world,"" Zhou Yi, Chairman and CEO of Huatai, said in a statement to Reuters.
""We are pleased to be the first issuer to tap this new market of enormous potential and unprecedented opportunity,"" he said, adding the offering would help Huatai expand its overseas footprint and strengthen its capital position.
The Shanghai-London Stock Connect represents China's latest efforts to open its capital markets. China has already linked mainland and Hong Kong stock markets with a separate connect scheme. 
Under the Shanghai-London Stock Connect, Chinese companies are allowed to raise fresh money through issuing GDRs in London. However, London-listed firms can initially only issue CDRs backed by existing shares, meaning they cannot raise funds through Shanghai listings.
Shanghai-London Stock Connecthas a range of businesses, including brokerage, wealth management and investment banking. 

The company, which calls itself technology-empowered, introduced Internet giants Alibaba and Suning this year as strategic investors.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Palm oil body says it finds exploitative labor practices at Malaysia's FGV,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A global palm oil industry watchdog rapped Malaysia's biggest palm oil producer, FGV Holdings (KL:FGVH), for ""exploitative"" labor practices, dire living conditions for its workers and lax oversight of contractors that hire its foreign labor. 
The findings are part of an investigation by a panel at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) following a Wall Street Journal report in 2015 that detailed abuses faced by foreign workers hired by contractors for FGV plantations. 
The RSPO panel found wide-ranging issues that were also in breach of its sustainability standards. It found that workers' movements were restricted as their passports were taken away, deductions in wages were not transparent and workers did not get adequate access to affordable food supplies. 
FGV said in a statement on Friday that it has frozen all new recruitment of workers from external contractors across its operations, with immediate effect, and that it will negotiate to directly employ these workers where possible. 
It will also immediately absorb the costs of basic necessities, including food supplies given to its workers. 
""Of the other findings by the RSPO complaints panel, the company is taking immediate measures to address all the issues raised as expeditiously as possible,"" it said. 
The panel said in a letter to FGV dated Nov. 28 and published on RSPO's website that the palm producer may have been complicit in human trafficking partly because of the company's failure to supervise its contractors. 
""FGV's practise/act of outsourcing its foreign workers to contractors is tantamount to exploitation,"" the panel said . 
The practice of outsourcing its foreign workers to contractors also violated Malaysian immigration law, it said. 
The panel recommended that the RSPO suspend FGV's sustainability certificate for its Kilang Sawit Serting palm oil mill and supply bases. 
It also called on FGV to commit to recruiting legal migrant workers and this commitment extends to its contractors. 
""Undoubtedly, FGV's weak control over its contractors exacerbates FGV's lack of control and supervision over its contractor's workers,"" the panel said. 
Activists said RSPO's recommended actions were not enough. 
""With this decision, the RSPO has again failed to adequately hold accountable one of its member companies found guilty of widespread illegal labor violations,"" said Robin Averbeck, Agribusiness Campaign Director for Rainforest Action Network. 
The RSPO is a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms that aims to promote the use of sustainable palm oil products. It is used by many European buyers as the international sustainability benchmark. 
Green groups have blamed RSPO for not doing enough to stop deforestation, habitat destruction and human rights abuses across plantations in top growers Indonesia and Malaysia.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Friday as weak data from China rekindled anxiety over slowing growth and investors fretted ahead of Saturday's crucial G20 talks between U.S. President Trump and China's Xi Jinping over trade.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) opened marginally up but rapidly fell into negative territory, down 0.5 percent by 0930 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the most sensitive to China due to its big exporters, fell 0.6 percent. 
The DAX was set for its fourth straight month of losses - its longest losing streak since 2008. The pan-European STOXX was set for its second straight month of losses as November, and a disappointing earnings season, draw to a close.
Investors' hopes of a partial recovery in stock markets in December - known as a ""Santa rally"" - hang on the leaders' discussions resulting in a truce or de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.
""There are only two people in the world that can deliver a Santa rally, Trump and Xi, and I don't see that happening,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. 
Garnry saw a 60 to 65 percent chance of the Trump-Xi talks resulting in ""no deal"".
China reported its weakest factory growth in more than two years on Friday, reigniting fears about growth ahead of crucial trade talks.
""The weak data out of China is increasingly a little bit of a surprise. Most investors would have anticipated that at least some of that stimulus six months ago would have had an impact, but this really tells us how big the headwinds are,"" said Garnry.
Autos stocks (SXAP) were the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent, on the data and anxiety over tariffs.
German car bosses are finalizing plans to visit the White House next week to discuss trade policy, German and U.S. officials said.
Car parts makers were among the worst-performing stocks, with Hella (DE:HLE),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), and tire maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) down 2.4 to 4.9 percent.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) dragged the DAX down with a 2.7 percent fall, while peers BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent. 
""The problem with Europe is that... quite a lot of our industrial supply chain and capital goods manufacturers have at least some exposure to the autos sector, so you can't get away from it,"" said Ian Ormiston, European smaller companies fund manager at Merian Global Investors. 
HSBC analysts downgraded both Faurecia and Daimler to ""reduce"" from ""hold"", saying a re-rating for the sector next year is ""hard to imagine"". Tariff fears have led analysts to slash their earnings growth forecasts for the sector.
Mining stocks (SXPP) fell 1.1 percent, hit by growth fears over China, the world's top metals consumer.
Among the biggest drags on the STOXX were also luxury goods conglomerates  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), down 1.8 percent each. Luxury stocks have been especially sensitive to slowing growth in China, high-end brands' biggest market. 
In single-stock moves Altice (AS:ATCA) shares surged 9.4 percent after the telecoms and cable firm announced its French unit had agreed to sell a 49.99 percent stake in its fiber optic business.
Zalando (DE:ZALG) fell 4.2 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its price target on the stock, saying it has become more skeptical about the long-term potential for margins at the online retailer.

The discussion about scrapping Joon, which has not been decided, may be a sign of the Canadian chief executive's determination to tackle weak Air France profitability head-on rather than mitigate it with lower-cost secondary offerings, as many of his predecessors have tried and failed to do.
The new CEO ""has made clear he doesn't understand the positioning or identity of Joon,"" one Air France source said. ""It's a question he's raised internally, several times.""
An Air France-KLM spokeswoman said ""no decision has been made"" on the future of Joon, when contacted by Reuters. She declined further comment.
Smith, hired in August to restore peace and prosperity to the Franco-Dutch group after devastating strikes that led to his predecessor's resignation, has said Air France must narrow the profitability gap with its more efficient KLM stablemate. The Dutch carrier recorded an 8.8 percent profit margin last year, more than double Air France's 3.7 percent margin.
The former Air Canada second-in-command is now urging Air France pilots to relinquish some perks if they want more pay rises, two people familiar with the matter said. That may include giving up downtown hotels and sleeping at the airport on long-haul layovers, as their KLM colleagues already do.
Layover accommodation is just one aspect of the complex accords now up for renegotiation with pilots' unions - who are pressing for a 4.7 percent pay increase in addition to the 4 percent company-wide raise negotiated last month to offset real-income erosion during earlier pay freezes.
""We've always had downtown hotels as part of our package,"" one pilot union official said. ""It's not really our job to hang around at airports for two days, as nice as they are.""
By winding down Joon, created a year ago, Smith could actually foster staff goodwill and help reach cost-saving agreements for Air France and its other two brands - low-cost operator Transavia and domestic short-haul Hop. Strikes earlier this year wiped 335 million euros ($381 million) off earnings.
Created by his predecessor Jean-Marc Janaillac to replace Air France on the least profitable routes, Joon combines standard company pilot contracts with 540 cabin staff on lower-cost terms. But it has proven unpopular with clients, employees and investors alike.
""The intention to get rid of Joon would be understandable,"" said HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg. ""You've got a whole new business created with all the complexity and cost, just to get a handful of cheap cabin crew - that's not rational.""
Smith ""should be negotiating what he can get in terms of productivity and efficiency across the whole Air France group, against which he trades the closure of Joon,"" Lobbenberg added.
The decision may be swayed by growing discontent among Joon cabin crew, who recently threatened fresh strike action unless pay and conditions are improved.
""When Ben Smith got here, he said to us, 'What is this Joon thing?',"" another Air France union official said. ""That's more or less what we've been saying all along.""

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 02:52AM ET</span>",Optional warning light could have aided Lion Air engineers before crash: experts,"By Jamie Freed and Eric M. Johnson
SINGAPORE/SEATTLE (Reuters) - An optional warning light could have alerted engineers about mechanical faults on Lion Air's Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet that crashed last month, experts said, sparking an industry debate over whether installing the system should become mandatory.
Lion Air did not install the AOA DISAGREE alert, which warns pilots when the ""angle of attack"" (AOA) readings do not match, because it is optional and not required by regulators, Managing Director Daniel Putut told Reuters. 
The angle is a key flight parameter that must remain narrow enough to preserve lift and avoid an aerodynamic stall. 
A faulty AOA reading led the doomed Lion Air jet's computer to believe it was stalled, prompting the plane's new anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), to repeatedly push down the nose. 
That made it harder for pilots to control the Boeing jet which crashed on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board, Indonesian investigators told parliament last week. 
""In retrospect, clearly it would have been wise to include the warning as standard equipment and fully inform and train operators on MCAS,"" said Clint Balog, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
""I expect you will see this warning included in future MAX production and retrofitted into already delivered MAX aircraft.""
Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) made the AOA alert an optional feature for the 737 MAX, meaning it was not deemed critical for safe operation.
The FAA has said it will continue to participate in Indonesia's investigation into the Lion Air crash and take further action if needed based on findings from the probe.
Indonesia's civil aviation regulator said it would follow the FAA's lead as to whether the AOA DISAGREE alert should be made mandatory for local airlines.

DEBATE ON COCKPIT INFORMATION
There has been a long-running industry debate about how much information should be displayed in the cockpit, notably about the angle at which the wing is slicing through the air.
Several carriers, including American Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Canada's WestJet, Singapore Airlines offshoot SilkAir and Dubai's flydubai, said the AOA DISAGREE alert was installed on their 737 MAX jets before the Lion Air crash. 
Some airlines have also installed a separate optional gauge that gives pilots a direct AOA reading in the cockpit.
American Airlines and SilkAir already have the gauge, while Southwest said it decided after the Lion Air crash to install the gauge on future 737 MAX deliveries to provide ""supplemental visual feedback for identifying erroneous AOA data"". 
Air Canada said it would install the gauge ""soon"" but did not clarify whether it had made the decision before or after the Lion Air crash. 
Boeing declined to comment on customer selections.

FAULTY READINGS
The planemaker has come under fire in the wake of the Lion Air crash for not outlining the automated system, MCAS, in the flight manual for the 737 MAX.
The new anti-stall system had also automatically pushed down the nose of the doomed Lion Air 737 MAX jet on its penultimate flight from Denpasar to Jakarta on the evening before the crash. 
The pilots had told engineers there had been a disagreement of altitude and airspeed readings based on cockpit alerts, a preliminary report released by Indonesian investigators shows.
There was, however, no mention of an AOA disagreement in their write-up, according to the report, and the plane was dispatched on its final flight the next morning from Jakarta. 
It crashed into the Java Sea and investigators have yet to determine the cause.
Having the AOA DISAGREE alert installed would ""definitely"" have helped, ""not in the least for discussion with the mechanic and entry in the flight log as information for the mechanics"", Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said. 
""I think given the introduction of MCAS, Boeing should make AOA DISAGREE a free and mandatory update,"" Fehrm added. 
The alert was offered as an option on the 737 MAX's predecessor, the 737NG, and several carriers contacted by Reuters said they had installed it on the older model too.
The alert light turns on when the AOA indications disagree by more than 10 degrees for 10 continuous seconds, according to an American Airlines 737 MAX flight manual obtained by Reuters. 
The doomed Lion Air jet had a 20 degree disparity throughout its last two flights, the Indonesian report shows.
The AOA DISAGREE alert could have aided if it was reported after the penultimate flight, professor Balog from Embry-Riddle said. ""Maintenance, if they knew about MCAS, would have known the potential for trouble that warning light would indicate.""
""The bigger question here is did Boeing realize the potential for this scenario if MCAS received bad AOA data?""

Boeing is weighing whether to launch a software upgrade to MCAS in six to eight weeks to help address the scenario faced by the Lion Air crew, Reuters reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 02:23AM ET</span>",Chinese sneeze could give Europe Inc. a nasty flu,"By Julien Ponthus, Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - With sluggish growth translating into the most disappointing earnings in years, European stocks are set for a tough ride if a full blown Sino-U.S. trade war erupts following Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping's G20 dinner on Saturday.
The ongoing tariff dispute has already made the Chinese economy sneeze and given a cold to some of Europe Inc's most iconic powerhouses due to their heavy exposure to the world's second biggest economy. 
This drag is set to continue even if Trump and Xi's meeting ends cordially. If relations between the economic superpowers deteriorate further, the impact on many of Europe's top firms could be profound.
Upmarket German car makers like BMW (DE:BMWG) or French luxury houses such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) have already been tagged as collateral victims of the Trump administration's trade policy after sharp falls in their share prices this year. 
With about six percent or roughly 80 billion euros of its constituents' revenues originating from China, Germany's DAX (GDAXi) is typically used as a proxy to bet on a trade war and is lagging, with a 12.5 percent fall year-to-date, the less exposed pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark.
BMW will make 18 percent of its revenue in 2018 from the world's second-largest economy, while Volkswagen's share stands at 14 percent, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Even if Germany, whose bilateral trade with China hit a record 188 billion euros last year, is a key concern, worries among investors are widespread. 
A study conducted for Reuters by business insights platform AlphaSense shows a threefold increase in the number of times a China slowdown was mentioned during European earnings conference calls between July and September this year.
While just 16 companies in the MSCI Europe index mentioned China in the context of a slowdown between April and June, that number climbed to 49 companies, in earnings calls during the following quarter. 
The mention of China, in any form or way, jumped from 361 to 540 during the same period.

(GRAPHIC: European companies increasingly cite China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QLBO3v) 
If some of the underperformance of European bourses in comparison to Wall Street can be partially explained by the Trump's administration tax cuts, many analysts believe the key lies elsewhere. 
""Europe is very much exposed, being very cyclical, it's an open economy and its stock markets already reflect that"", explained Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""European markets are quite vulnerable to a slowdown in emerging markets, not less given the domestic dynamic which is polluted by the political problems in Italy or Brexit,"" he added referring to Britain leaving the European Union and the Italian government's tug-of-war with Brussels over its budget.
An escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war would force Dutch asset manager NN Investments to reassess its view that European stocks are due for a comeback in 2019. 
""It's the biggest threat,"" said Valentijn van Niewenhuisen, head of multi-asset at the firm. 
Acknowledging slowing growth, the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for China and since then indicators from automobile sales to e-commerce trends and production data are suggesting the world's second biggest economy is cooling somewhat.
With creeping corporate and household debts, China is believed to have little room for maneuver for fiscal stimulus if it doesn't want to weaken its currency, which the Trump administration believes gives it an unfair trading advantage.
Data compiled by Morgan Stanley shows how European miners are not the only ones dependent on the appetite of material hungry China.

'THE BIGGEST THREAT'
CHINA SYNDROME
Aside from basic material providers, firms such as France's fashion giant  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the owner of Gucci, and Switzerland's jeweler  Richemont  (S:CFR) have a sales exposure of 24 percent.
Analysts at Jefferies have nicknamed the contamination of luxury stocks a reverse ""China Syndrome"", in reference to a 1979 movie in which a nuclear meltdown in the United States could make its way through the Earth to China. 
""It would appear that the reverse threat is now in place in the Personal Luxury Goods sector with fears of a sharp slowdown in China threatening to contaminate the entire sector starting in 2019.""
Other companies under threat are the big German industrial powerhouses such as  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) or BASF (DE:BASFn).
""We're concerned about what's embedded in German industrials' share prices. They embed continued profitability in China that's very strong and continued growth and we're skeptical that's sustainable,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn, director at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners, where he helps manage $30 billion.
But the reliance on the Chinese market isn't only worrying investors. 
A new strategy paper from Germany's influential BDI industry federation calls on firms to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market. 
While their presence there was once seen as a strength, it is now unsettling German politicians and industry as Beijing asserts control over the economy under President Xi Jinping.
This weekend's G20 meeting between the leaders of the world's top two economies will be key for market sentiment, which has been battered by the months-long trade spat.
But investors aren't betting on an end to the dispute any time soon.

""Ultimately it's hard to see China will be able or willing to offer enough to meet U.S. demands so things could get worse,"" said Royal London senior economist Melanie Baker.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>",Spoils of trade war: Argentina loads up on cheap U.S. soybeans,"By Hugh Bronstein and Karl Plume
BUENOS AIRES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A ship named the Torrent is nearing the end of a 5,000-mile trip carrying soybeans from the U.S. Great Lakes to Argentina - a journey that only makes economic sense because of the U.S.-China trade war.
The ship is scheduled to dock in the Rosario grains hub on Dec. 4, days after the leaders of the world's two largest economies, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, hold high-stakes trade talks in Buenos Aires.
They will meet on the sidelines of a Group of 20 nations summit and are expected to discuss how to roll back tit-for-tat tariffs - covering goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars - that have skewed global trade flows.
The Torrent's 20,000-tonne soybean cargo is one such distortion, and just one of 14 ships the Argentine soy crusher Vicentin has lined up to import U.S. soybeans, according to port data reviewed by Reuters. The previously unreported shipments are among the first significant Argentine purchases from the United States in two decades, according to Vicentin's broker and port data, as the nation's government and industry moves to capitalize on the tumult of the U.S.-China conflict.
Argentina - one of the world's top soybean exporters, and the top exporter of processed meal and oil - usually has no reason to import beans. But this year, the South American nation has raced to the top of the list of U.S. soybean importers because the prices of U.S. beans have fallen by 15 percent since late May, when China first threatened tariffs on them.
""One of the consequences of the trade war is that U.S. beans have to find a new home,"" said Thomas Hinrichsen, president of Buenos Aires-based brokerage J.J. Hinrichsen SA, which cut the deals for Vicentin. ""You are in the money to ship cheaper U.S. beans into efficient crushing plants in Argentina.""
Beyond price, Argentina needs U.S. beans to feed its massive soy-crushing industry after a punishing drought. What is left of the nation's own crops are going to feed pigs in China - where buyers are paying a premium for South American soybeans to fill the gap left by virtually halted imports from the United States.
""The combination of the drought in Argentina and the soy glut in the United States caused by the trade conflict has directed U.S. soybeans toward Argentina,"" said Guillermo Wade, manager of Argentina's Port and Maritime Activities Chamber. ""They are being used to keep our crushers working while freeing Argentine soybeans to go to China.""
Argentina's International Trade Secretary, Marisa Bircher, told Reuters Argentina was also seeking to export more soy and byproducts to India and Southeast Asia. Argentina's current top soymeal buyers include the European Union, Vietnam and Indonesia.
""Clearly, this U.S.-China conflict is generating a change in the grain trade,"" Bircher said.
The grains powerhouse is even negotiating a license to export soymeal directly to China - which has until now only imported Argentine beans for crushing in China.
""We have a very good relationship with China... we are negotiating to open the market to soybean meal before the end of the year,"" said Bircher.
Argentina collects export taxes from companies on agricultural goods like soy, corn and wheat shipments, providing it with much needed revenue in the midst of an economic crisis.
The country, which is in the global spotlight as G20 host, has good relations with both the United States and China and has sought deals with both in recent weeks as it seeks to cash in on opportunities that have arisen due to the trade war.
Besides seeking the soymeal deal with China, it has negotiated a deal to export beef to the United States for the first time in 17 years. 
The Torrent, which loaded a month ago at a Toledo, Ohio facility operated by Ohio-based The Andersons, is one of 43 U.S. soybean ships that have sailed for Argentina since July and the second to sail from the Great Lakes region, on the other side of the world from the South American country. Just nine have sailed for China.
A year ago, 282 soybean cargo vessels were loaded in the United States bound for China in that time and none to Argentina, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
(GRAPHIC: U.S.-China trade war shifts soybean destinations - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DRzVij) 
'UNNATURAL DESTINATIONS'
China's soybean tariffs, which have virtually halted purchases of U.S. soybeans that last year totaled $12 billion, came in retaliation for Trump's duties on Chinese steel and aluminum. That has left U.S. farmers and grains merchants with huge inventories of soybeans because China typically buys 60 percent of U.S. soy exports.
Grains companies have had to adapt quickly to keep massive volumes of perishable goods moving at the lowest possible cost.
Bulk grain terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the most direct outlet for Asia-bound shipments, are handling a quarter of their normal autumn soybean volume. The beans that are hauled there by rail are instead heading east to Great Lakes terminals or south to Mexico or Gulf Coast ports bound for countries other than China.
""By shipping soybeans out of the U.S. to unnatural destinations - and moving Brazilian and Argentine soybeans in place of that into China when they should have come out of the U.S. West Coast - there's an inherent logistics cost in this,"" Soren Schroder, Chief Executive of global grain trader  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) told Reuters in a recent interview. 
The inefficiencies amount to ""many, many millions"" of dollars in new costs, borne by the whole industry, he said. 
(GRAPHIC: Soybean vessel Torrent steams for Argentina - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RmRZ7G)
TARIFF ARBITRAGE 
The changes have also presented opportunities for agricultural trading giants such as Bunge, Louis Dreyfus Company and Cargill Inc, who are making money processing cheaper U.S. soybeans in Argentina and Canada. They're also selling those countries' unprocessed beans at a premium to Chinese buyers who are struggling to replace the huge volume of soybeans they typically buy from the United States.
Nimble traders are reaping big profits, but the opportunities may be fleeting.
""Everyone's getting on the 'Make America Great' Trump gravy train for soybeans from Canada,"" said Dwight Gerling, president of Toronto-based DG Global, a Canadian exporter of soybeans by container. 
On a delivered basis to China, Canadian soybeans were fetching a premium of up to $3 per bushel this fall over the Chicago futures price, more than double the premium U.S. soybeans make in export markets, he said. 
DG Global has increased soybean sales volumes by 80 percent year to date, due entirely to the U.S.-China trade fight, Gerling said. DG buys cheap U.S. soybeans to ship to its regular southeast Asian buyers - who would normally buy Canadian soy - and this autumn sent its Canadian soybeans to China, a new market for the company.
The sales to China have recently slowed, however, with winter shipping restrictions approaching on the Great Lakes, Gerling said. Chinese bids for Canadian soybeans are now only slightly higher than bids from other countries for American soybeans.
While companies are finding new ways to make money, U.S. farmers in the export-focused Dakotas are feeling the sting of the trade battle as prices at their local elevators for their newly harvested soybeans are the lowest in more than a decade.
The concern there and elsewhere among U.S. farmers is that the damage to their relationships with Chinese buyers - built up over three decades - will be difficult to repair even if Trump and Xi strike a deal in Buenos Aires. 

""The Chinese can get soybeans from other places if we're not a reliable supplier,"" said Bob Metz, a fifth generation farmer in Peever, South Dakota. ""They have 1.4 billion people to feed. They don't want to be dependent on us.""

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 12:15AM ET</span>","China funds cut equity exposure as trade war, economic worries linger: Reuters poll","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese fund managers continued to lower their suggested equity exposure for the next three months, amid lingering concerns over an economic slowdown and the Sino-U.S. trade spat, though some started to turn optimistic given the low levels of overall stock valuations in the market.
Fund managers have lowered their suggested equity allocations to 68.6 percent, down from 70.6 percent a month earlier and lowest since August, according to a poll of seven China-based fund managers conducted this week.
They reduced their suggested bond allocations for the coming three months to 8.6 percent from 12.5 percent and added their recommended cash allocations to 22.9 percent from 16.9 percent in the previous month.
""For the short term, eyes were on the talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the U.S. president Donald Trump who will meet on the sidelines of G20 Summit, and there are good chances the two will reach a consensus not to deteriorate the trade tensions,"" said a Shenzhen-based fund manager.
A consensus or a more positive outcome, if achieved, could help lift risk appetite and valuations recovery, otherwise the stock market could be falling back, the fund manager added.
""According to the situation in the G20 Summit, there is a risk of seesaw Sino-U.S. trade frictions, and China's exports could witness a substantial fall in January and February next year,"" a Shanghai-based fund manager said. 
Three fund managers expressed their worries over a continuation of economic slowdown, though they believed the slowdown could bring about marginal easing in monetary policies and increased efforts by the Chinese government to bolster the economy. In view of the current domestic environments, those fund managers expected the infrastructure spending to be used again as a key measure to stabilize the economy.
Overall, the fund managers surveyed held mixed views on asset allocations for the next month, with four recommending boosting equity exposure, while three suggesting a status quo.
According to the poll, average recommended allocations for electronics and machinery stocks in the next three months jumped, those for real estate also rose, while those for consumer, auto, energy and transport slipped.
""The best opportunities lie in undervalued stocks and sectors,"" a Shenzhen-based fund manager said. 

For the month, average recommended allocations for electronic firms rose to 18.7 percent from 12.6 percent, those for machinery firms climbed to 7.9 percent from 3.4 percent, while those for real estate firms increased to 9.9 percent from 8.6 percent.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares wavered on Friday as investors were on edge before a crucial weekend meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents that could determine the course of a heated trade war over the next year.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan wobbled between positive and negative territory in early trade, as more evidence of a slowdown in China dampened sentiment. It was last up less than 0.1 percent and has risen 2.7 percent for the week so far, largely reflecting a rebound from a recent steep sell-off. 
In Japan, the Nikkei was up 0.4 percent, while Korean shares dropped 0.2 percent after the country's central bank lifted its policy interest rate in a widely expected decision. 
Chinese blue-chips advanced 0.5 percent despite a survey showing China's factory growth stalled for the first time in more than two years in November.
The weak manufacturing growth reinforced expectations that Beijing will roll out more economic support measures - a factor that has helped to prop up battered Chinese stocks recently. 
Investor attention is now squarely focused on planned talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart over the weekend on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina. 
Victor Huang, head of investment strategy at Guotai Junan International in Hong Kong, said a no-deal outcome could lead to ""much more volatile"" markets next week. 
U.S. S&P e-mini futures ticked down 0.06 percent, pointing to a weaker Wall Street session on Friday after a mixed overnight performance.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent on Thursday. 
Adding to apprehension ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting were comments from a U.S. official, who said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated a tougher trade stance with China, would attend.
The mixed signals from Washington about the prospects for a rapprochement with China on trade kept investors on the sidelines. 
""Rather than jump at headlines, the market has taken a laid-back approach and prices are treading water until we see the outcome,"" analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note.
Australian shares underperformed regional peers, falling 1.3 percent as beverage maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Amatil Ltd, dropped 14.2 percent on a weak outlook for 2019.
""They billed it as another transformational year, which fund managers think means profit growth is not going to be that good,"" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney.
Global investors also remain hesitant to shift positions significantly as they seek clarity on Federal Reserve policy direction. 
Minutes of the latest Fed policy meeting showed that almost all officials agreed another interest rate increase was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but opened debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public.
The minutes follow comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that some took as indicating a dovish shift. 
The yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes, seen as sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.8066 percent on Friday, down from a U.S. close of 2.813 percent.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 3.0243 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 3.035 percent on Thursday. 
The dollar dropped 0.07 percent against the yen to 113.39, while the euro was flat at $1.1392. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major rivals, was also flat at 96.769.
In commodities markets, crude prices extended gains on news that Russia is increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output along with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and its allies are meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6-7.
U.S. crude gained 0.37 percent to $51.64 a barrel, and Brent crude was up 0.42 percent at $59.76 per barrel.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 11:15PM ET</span>",Australian financial sector faces reckoning as misconduct inquiry ends,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A year-long inquiry that exposed widespread wrongdoing in Australia's financial industry ended on Friday ahead of a final report due by Feb. 1 that could reshape the sector. 
Dismissed initially as a ""populist whinge"" by the ruling conservative party, the quasi-judicial Royal Commission has revealed branch-to-boardroom misconduct which has smashed bank share prices as investors brace for tougher regulation.
In 69 days of hearings since February, the inquiry heard shocking tales of rip-offs, callous mistreatment of customers, deception of regulators and even taking money from the dead. 
In its final two weeks it grilled the CEOs of Australia's biggest banks and wealth managers, exploring questions around remuneration, governance, culture, the conflicting interests of shareholders and customers, and the regulatory structure of the industry.
The final report from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne, a former High Court justice leading the inquiry, will contain recommendations for how to clean up the industry. It could also recommend civil or criminal charges against individuals.
The inquiry's revelations have already wiped about A$40 billion ($29 billion) from the market value of wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) and Australia's four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB).
Some analysts expect further share price falls in response to Hayne's recommendations in February, which are likely to lead to stricter oversight and a greater burden of compliance that could narrow profit margins across the industry. 
Banks have pre-empted some recommendations by cracking down on loose consumer lending practices, cutting executive bonuses, exiting non-core wealth management businesses and ending some commission payments that created conflicts of interest. 
Australia's top financial regulators have moved too, vowing to adopt a more litigious stance and change their reputation of being too soft on the companies they are meant to police.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 10:44PM ET</span>",Search for remains in California's deadliest wildfire officially ends,"By Lee van der Voo
CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Three weeks after flames incinerated most of a Northern California town in the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, the search for more human remains has officially ended with at least 88 people confirmed dead and nearly 200 still listed as missing.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said he was optimistic that some who remain unaccounted for will turn up alive, but he also left open the possibility that ""bones or bone fragments"" of additional victims could turn up as evacuation zones are reopened to civilians.
With the fire reduced to embers, the National Weather Service on Thursday issued a flash-flood warning for the burn zone as showers and thunderstorms heightened the risk of heavy runoff in areas stripped of vegetation by the fire.
At a news conference on Wednesday night Honea said search and recovery teams had finished combing through the ruins of approximately 18,000 homes and other buildings leveled by the Camp Fire, which ranks as the most destructive in state history.
The bulk of the devastation occurred in and around the hamlet of Paradise, a town once home to nearly 27,000 people, many of them retirees, in the Sierra foothills about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. 
More than 1,000 personnel, including cadaver dog teams, forensic anthropologists, coroners and National Guard troops from five states, took part in the grim effort.
""I believe that we have done our due diligence with regard to searching for human remains. My sincere hope is that no additional human remains will be located,"" Honea told reporters in the nearby town of Chico.
Asked directly whether authorities had ceased actively searching burned structures, the sheriff answered yes.
The current death toll of 88 already stands as the greatest loss of life on record from a single wildfire in California and the most from a wildfire anywhere in the United States dating back to Minnesota's 1918 Cloquet Fire, which killed as many as 1,000 people. The Camp Fire also exceeds the 87 lives lost in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in 1910.
Authorities attribute the Camp Fire's high casualty count in large part to the tremendous speed with which flames raced through Paradise with little advance warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees.
The remains of many victims were found in the ashen rubble of homes, others inside or near the burned-out wreckage of vehicles. 
The cause of the blaze, which was fully contained earlier this week, remained under investigation. But PG&E Corp reported equipment problems near the origin of the fire around the time it began on Nov. 8.
The official roster of people unaccounted for has fluctuated widely from day to day, but as of Wednesday night the list was winnowed to 196 names, down from a peak of 1,200-plus over a week ago.

The sheriff said the list had since been scrubbed of all duplicate names and that investigators had caught up with a backlog of unprocessed missing-persons reports.

Shares in China and Hong Kong were up but they were down in most other major markets, including Japan, South Korea and Australia.
The G20 meeting that starts Friday night for Asia is likely to feature a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. U.S. officials have signaled that a deal on trade might be possible. Such a deal, if it happens, could bring a truce in the ongoing China-U.S. trade war.
Still, expectations of a substantial deal coming out of the meeting of the two presidents were low.
The trade war is having an impact on both sides. China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released on Friday showed that new orders shrank in November and growth stalled for the first time in more than two years. The PMI fell to 50, down from 50.2 in October. A number above 50 signals expansion, so a reading of 50 is neutral. Analysts had expected the PMI to hold at 50.2, according to Reuters.
Still, stocks in China were trading higher at mid-morning Friday, while bourses in Japan, South Korea and Australia were all in the red.

Padmasree Warrior, chief executive officer of NIO USA and global chief development officer, will resign from her posts on Dec. 17 for ""personal interests"", the company said.
Warrior joined Nio, previously called NextEV, in 2015, and led the company along with founder and CEO William Li to become one of China's most legitimate challengers in the global race to develop electric vehicles.
Before joining Nio, Warrior was chief technology and strategy officer at Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) and chief technology officer at Motorola (NYSE:MSI).
China is the world's largest and fast-growing market for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrids. 
NEV sales in the first 10 months of 2018 came in at 860,000 vehicles, up 75.6 percent year-on-year.
Competition is, however, rising as Beijing looks to rein in subsidies that led to a huge array of EV contenders entering the market. Some of those are now being weeded out.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia objected to what he said was the government’s and companies’ treatment of him as a ""rubber stamp"" for the deal, noting that CVS had closed its deal to buy Aetna for $69 billion on Wednesday.
CVS said in a statement, ""It's commonplace for acquisitions to close before this final step in the process is complete, and our focus remains on delivering on the combined company's potential."" 
The Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment. 
The Justice Department gave its OK in October for the merger of CVS, a pharmacy and benefits manager firm, and Aetna on condition that the health insurer sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans. The court must approve the agreement between the government and merging companies. 
Leon raised the prospect of not deciding on the deal until the summer, or perhaps rejecting it, before setting another hearing for Monday.
“I was reviewing your motion, which, of course is not opposed. And I kind of got this uneasy feeling that I was being kept in the dark, kind of like a mushroom,” Leon told lawyers for the Justice Department and the two companies, noting that the American Medical Association, among others, had objected to the deal.
“I’m very concerned, very concerned that you all are proceeding on a rubber-stamp approach to this,” he told them, according to a transcript of the hearing.

The probe examines the actions of the New York-based investment bank as well as individuals and has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the inquiry is confidential. The Fed doesn’t have the powers of a criminal prosecutor, but it can and often does sanction people involved in banking scandals.
The Fed has previously interviewed current and former employees at the firm, prying into how easy it is to short-circuit compliance systems, the people said. In recent weeks, representatives from Goldman Sachs met with the Fed and defended the bank’s controls, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
As Goldman Sachs’s main regulator, the Fed has broad authority to penalize the bank or impose other changes. Earlier this year, it capped  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s size until the lender shores up internal controls.
“It is the Federal Reserve’s policy not to confirm or deny the existence of investigations,” the central bank said in an emailed statement. “We refer criminal violations to the Department of Justice as necessary and exercise our enforcement and safety and soundness authorities if the facts are warranted.”
Leissner’s Plea
In a guilty plea unveiled this month, Goldman Sachs’s former head of Southeast Asia, Tim Leissner, said he and others conspired to conceal facts from the firm’s compliance and legal staff. Leissner said he and his colleagues hid, for example, the involvement of controversial financier Low Taek Jho while setting out to raise more than $6 billion on behalf of 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a Malaysian state investment company that investigators say was plundered.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Low of masterminding schemes to launder funds from 1MDB and pay kickbacks to Malaysian government officials. Low and a group of Malaysians allegedly diverted some of the money raised into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses. Low maintains his innocence.
Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges he conspired to launder money and violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He’s been ordered to forfeit $43.7 million. He admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman Sachs, and he said he and others arranged the 1MDB fundraising as debt offerings because it would generate higher fees for the bank.
In a statement to the court, Leissner said his behavior was “very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees.” The Justice Department has also said in filings that the business culture at Goldman Sachs, particularly in Southeast Asia, prioritized consummating deals ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.
Still, the DOJ filings said individual bankers knowingly circumvented controls the bank had in place and hid certain details about the deal to prevent compliance officers from seeking to block the firm’s involvement in the transactions.
Since prosecutors unveiled their indictments this month, analysts and investors have been trying to gauge what the financial fallout might be for Goldman. In behind-the-scenes talks with authorities, the firm has presented information that isolates much of the blame on Leissner, people with knowledge of those exchanges have said. Yet publicly, it has acknowledged it may spend significantly to resolve the case.
“The firm has received subpoenas and requests for documents and information from various governmental and regulatory bodies,” including the Department of Justice, the company wrote in a regulatory filing this month that didn’t specify the Fed’s interest.
Goldman said in the filing that it’s cooperating with investigators and that while it can’t predict the outcome, “any proceedings by the DOJ or other governmental or regulatory authorities could result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties and other sanctions.”

(Reuters) - Puerto Rico concluded a U.S. bankruptcy court-approved restructuring of its Government Development Bank (GDB) debt, marking its first consensual deal with creditors under a federal oversight law, government officials announced on Thursday.
The GDB deal addresses only about $4 billion of the $120 billion of debt and pension obligations Puerto Rico is seeking to restructure under a form of bankruptcy filed by the U.S. commonwealth's federal oversight board in 2017.
""The closing of the qualifying modification for GDB is clear evidence that Puerto Rico has the credibility and resolve necessary to resolve its fiscal challenges,"" Governor Ricardo Rosselló said in a statement.
Under the deal, the newly formed GDB Debt Recovery Authority issued nearly $2.6 billion of taxable 7.5 percent bonds due in 2040, according to the statement. Bondholders will receive $550 of new bonds for every $1,000 of their existing GDB bond claims, while Puerto Rico municipalities will realize about $55 million in near-term debt service savings.
The GDB deal was accomplished through Title VI of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability (PROMESA) Act approved by Congress in 2016 that provides for a consensual restructuring framework between the government and creditors.
In September, GDB creditors overwhelmingly approved the deal, which transfers the defunct bank’s municipal loan portfolios, real estate assets and unencumbered cash to the new recovery authority. The new bonds are backed by a statutory lien on those assets.
Puerto Rico has other debt restructuring deals in the works, including one for the island's bankrupt Sales Tax Financing Corporation, known as COFINA. If completed, the transaction would tackle roughly $16 billion of sales tax-backed bonds.
U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who approved the GDB plan earlier this month, is expected to rule on a COFINA deal in January. 
A final deal over debt issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) could be tougher to reach after bond insurance companies that were not part of a preliminary restructuring agreement relaunched litigation in October seeking a receiver for the power agency.
""My administration is committed to continue negotiating in good faith with Puerto Rico’s creditors and pursue creative solutions that safeguard the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico,” Rosselló said. 
Meanwhile, the island's oversight board, created under the PROMESA Act, announced on Thursday the appointment of Brown Rudnick LLP as counsel to its committee investigating potential claims against parties involved in Puerto Rico's financial crisis.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing eyes Lion Air crash software upgrade in 6-8 weeks,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is weighing plans to launch a software upgrade for its 737 MAX in six to eight weeks that would help address a scenario faced by the Lion Air crew during last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
Crash investigators are focusing on the possibility that a new anti-stall system that repeatedly pushed the Lion Air jetliner's nose down was being fed by erroneous data from a faulty sensor left in place after a previous hazardous flight.
Boeing has said cockpit procedures that were applied on the previous flight are already in place to tackle such a problem, and that its 737 series remains safe to fly.
But U.S. regulators have said Boeing is also examining a possible software fix, after coming under fire for not outlining recent changes to the automated system in the manual for the 737 MAX, the latest version of its best-selling passenger jet.
While plans for the possible fix are not final, Boeing's software upgrade could block the recently modified anti-stall system, known as MCAS, from continuously running until the plane hits its nose-down limit, the sources said.
The MCAS function would be disabled if the crew counteracted it by trimming or adjusting settings in the opposite direction, according to two people briefed on Boeing's proposals. 
""When the crew makes the adjustment, that would essentially disengage MCAS unless it got new data,"" one of the people said.
Data from the Lion Air flight recorder suggests the pilots sought to correct the system more than two dozen times before the jetliner plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people onboard. 
Attention has focused on the role of a suspect ""angle of attack"" sensor used to drive alerts on stall or loss of lift.
While each 737 has two of these blade-shaped vanes, the plane's anti-stall system relies on data pulled from just a single vane during each flight, compared with a three-sensor ""voting"" system on rival Airbus (PA:AIR) jetliners. 
Boeing's software update would come as an emergency measure from Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration, the sources said. 
SECOND PROBE 
The specific system for preventing stalls was not originally designed to monitor both probes because regulators assumed risks of a mishap were small and would be further reduced by the presence of a trained crew and power switches on errant systems.
Now, however, Boeing is examining whether the anti-stall system should also check data from the second probe before engaging, according to a person briefed on the matter. 
Boeing declined comment on the proposed changes.
""As part of our standard practice following any accident or incident, we examine our aircraft design and operation, and when appropriate, issue bulletins and make recommendations to operators to further enhance safety,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said. 
""Boeing continues to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.""
The FAA has repeatedly said it will ""take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant.""
A decision to update the software has not been finalised and Boeing could choose a different strategy, the people said.
The world's largest planemaker has 4,542 of the upgraded 737 MAX on order from airlines, worth over half a trillion dollars at list prices, or about half that after typical discounts. 

Boeing has delivered 241 of the jets to customers since it entered service last year, according to its website.

The company had the second position in worldwide PC shipments in the third quarter with a 22.8 percent market share, down from 23.9 percent in the preceding quarter, according to research firm International Data Corp's data. 
HP Inc said revenue from its printing business rose 9.1 percent to $5.30 billion, slightly short of analysts' estimate of $5.31 billion.
The company completed the acquisition of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) printer business for $1.05 billion in November 2017 as a part of its efforts to strengthen the sluggish printer and copier business.
HP Inc said, in a post earnings call with analysts, it has not considered any impact from unannounced tariffs or any significant demand changes that may result from an increase in geopolitical uncertainties. The Palo Alto, California-based company said it would consider price increases to respond to tariffs.
""We are working through a variety of mitigation items on the tariffs, pricing included to be one of the ways we mitigate,"" said Chief Financial Officer Steve Fieler during the call.
The company forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of 50 cents to 53 cents per share. Analysts expected a profit of 52 cents per share.
Net earnings rose to $1.45 billion, or 91 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, from $660 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 54 cents per share, in line with average analyst estimates.
The company said its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and profit exclude after-tax adjustments of $586 million, or 37 cents per share, related to restructuring and other charges and acquisition-related charges. 

Net revenue rose 10.3 percent $15.37 billion. Analysts on an average had expected revenue of $15.1 billion.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 07:49PM ET</span>",Dell posts revenue jump ahead of voting on VMware offer,"(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (N:DVMT) reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, as businesses were forced to upgrade their systems running on older Windows technology and on strong performance by software maker VMware.
The results come ahead of voting on the company's offer to buy back shares tied to its 81 percent economic stake in VMware Inc (N:VMW), which would allow Dell a return to public markets without going through the rigors of a traditional initial public offer process.
Dell earlier this month sweetened its cash-and-stock offer to $23.9 billion, winning backing from shareholders including Carl Icahn, who had opposed the initial bid, as well as from Elliott Management and Canyon Partners.
""We expect the transaction to close in this calendar year, with the projected close date and first day of trading for the Class C common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'DELL' on December 28,"" Dell's head of investor relations Robert Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on a conference call with analysts.
The offer is scheduled to be voted on Dec.11. 
Dell reported an 11 percent jump in revenue from its Client Solutions Group, which includes products such as desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, and branded peripherals, for the third quarter ended Nov. 2.
The gain was largely due to businesses looking to replace their older machines following Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) decision to stop all support for its Windows 7 operating system early in 2020.
""The market has reached a state of stabilization so far this year, primarily driven by strong commercial demand driven by Windows 10 upgrades, being linked to end of Windows 7 support,"" said Ishan Dutt, an analyst with research firm Canalys.
Dell held 17 percent of the global PC market share year-to-date, behind HP Inc's (N:HPQ) 23 percent and Lenovo Group Ltd's (HK:0992) 21 percent share, according to data from Canalys.
HP Inc on Thursday reported an 11 percent rise in revenue in its personal systems business, which also topped analysts' estimates. 
On the call, Dell executives said the company has successfully navigated the current list of tariffs. 
""Where we have incurred in higher cost with tariffs, we can pass that through to end users,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Clarke said.
For fiscal year ending 2019, the company expects total adjusted revenue in the range of $90.5 billion and $92 billion. The company had reported adjusted revenue of $79.9 billion for the fiscal year ended Feb.2, 2018.
Total revenue rose 15 percent to $22.48 billion in the quarter, while net loss attributable widened to $876 million.
VMware posted robust results, beating on both profit and revenue estimates on strong demand for its software to boost cloud computing efficiency.
The company's shares, up about 30 percent this year, rose nearly 8 percent to $174.65 after the bell.

Hyundai Motor stocks have plunged more than 30 percent this year and U.S. hedge fund Elliott earlier this month renewed pressure on the automaker to return its ""excess capital"" to shareholders.
In May, Hyundai Motor Group, backed by founding family members, shelved an ownership restructuring plan that would have given the son of its aging chairman more control of the conglomerate, following opposition from Elliott. 
Hyundai said in a regulatory filing it would buy back common stocks worth 214 billion won and preferred stocks worth 41 billion won. The buyback is expected to start on Dec. 3 this year and end on Feb. 28, 2019. 
Shares of Hyundai Motor affiliates also gained ground, with Kia Motors (KS:000270) up 2.4 percent and  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330) gaining 1.7 percent, while the wider market (KS11) was up 0.2 percent as of 0015 GMT.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",German car bosses finalizing White House meeting next week,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Top executives from German carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are finalizing plans for a White House meeting on trade policy next week, German and U.S. officials said on Thursday.
Officials from the carmakers, asking not to be named, said the meeting was tentatively set for Tuesday, and would include VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and BMW production chief Oliver Zipse.
President Donald Trump has been harshly critical of German automakers and what he sees as an unfair trade imbalance on autos. 
He has threatened for months to impose tariffs on vehicles assembled in the EU, a move that could upend the industry's business model for selling cars in the United States. 
However, he has refrained from such a measure while Washington and Brussels undertake talks to cut other trade barriers. 
The CEOs plan to make clear they cannot negotiate on behalf of the EU, people close to the matter said last week. 
VW's new top executive in the Americas told reporters on Wednesday that the company was deciding where to locate a new factory in North America to build electric cars for the U.S. market. 
Earlier on Thursday, Trump tweeted that ""auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW, which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming."" 
Other sources familiar with the matter said Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, had set up the meeting, but the exact date was still being negotiated. Top car bosses were also slated to appear at an automotive summit in the northern German city of Wolfsburg, where VW is based, on Tuesday.
Christina Higgins, spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Berlin, said the Dec. 4 date was suggested by the German automakers but had not been finalised. ""It's merely a suggestion at this point,"" she said.
The Handelsblatt newspaper, which first reported the meeting would take place Tuesday, said Grenell told carmakers that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would attend the meeting.
It was not immediately clear if Grenell would take part.

The United States currently imposes import tariffs on cars assembled in the EU of 2.5 percent, compared with 10 percent tariffs for U.S.-built cars entering the European trading bloc.

1641,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Eyes on Argentina
In a day light on economic data and almost empty on the earnings front, the market could be even more susceptible to any hints of progress (or retreat) in U.S. and China trade negotiations.
U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are expected to meet of the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, which starts tomorrow. There will be a dinner meeting between the two leaders, and staff, Saturday evening.
The market was briefly encouraged today after Trump said he close to doing “something” on trade with China, but he added that he wasn’t sure he wanted to do it.Optimism also faded after it was confirmed U.S. China hawk Peter Navarro will attend the dinner.
Any sense of progress could buoy the markets on going into Saturday on hopes of a tentative deal. Trump’s twitter feed will be closely watched, as will dispatches from reporters at the summit.
But investors should also prepare for volatility as algorithmic trading is exacerbating any swings on mentions of a trade deal or breakdown.
2. Chicago PMI Expected to Rise
The main piece of economic data out tomorrow is the latest measure of Midwest manufacturing activity.
The Chicago purchasing manager’s index (PMI) is due at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the Chicago PMI ticked up slightly to 58.6.
Shortly before that, New York Fed President John Williams will give a speech on “The Global Economy: Addressing a Future Downturn.”
3. G20 Also Big for Oil Markets
Oil traders will also be on the lookout for any news coming out of the G20.
Prices rallied today after a report that Russia was now leaning to a production cut.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak will be in Buenos Aires together and a basis for a cut in supply could be agreed on the sidelines.
Any production cut would officially be announced at the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6.
Oil will also be tethered to any news on China-U.S. trade discussions as many traders feel a drawn out trade war will hurt global economic growth, weakening demand for crude."

1643,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Snaps 3-Day Winning Streak as Trade Concerns Weigh,"Investing.com - The Dow snapped a three-day winning streak Thursday, pressured by selling moments before the close, even as minutes from the Fed's November meeting fueled expectations for a slower pace of rate hikes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11%. The S&P 500 fell 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25%.
The Fed's minutes continued to tout the case for gradual rate hikes, but also showed that concerns were growing among Fed members about the impact on the economy of a possible overshoot on rate hikes.
""A couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations,"" the minutes read.
The release of the minutes helped lift sentiment on stocks, but concerns over trade ultimately prevailed. The South China Morning Post reported that White House advisor Peter Navarro, a China trade hawk, would be attending the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires at the G20.
A rally in energy supported the broader market, on the back of a rise in oil prices, following reports that Russia could participate in a production cut expected to be announced at the enlarged OPEC+ meeting on Dec. 6.
Tech, meanwhile, added to gains from a day earlier, supported by FANG stocks.
Among FANGs, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose more than 2% as the streaming giant unveiled plans to hike prices for subscribers in Canada.
On the earnings front, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Abercrombie & Fitch Company (NYSE:ANF) were rewarded for beating third-quarter earnings estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending their shares sharply higher.
Economic data offered some positive takeaways as consumer spending, which accounts for large chuck of economy growth, remained robust. But housing and inflation data fell short of economists' forecasts.
""On the inflation front, the news was softer than expected and gives a bit of support to the market's view that the Fed will take things slower from here,"" CIBC said in a note.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 04:02PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Burger chain Jack in the Box explores sale - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Jack in the Box Inc (O:JACK), a U.S. hamburger restaurant chain with more than 2,000 restaurants, is exploring options that could include a sale of the company after divesting its Qdoba brand earlier this year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
A sale would be the latest in a series of deals in the fast food sector this year, including the sale of drive-in burger chain Sonic to Arby's owner Inspire Brands for about $1.57 billion.
Jack in the Box started talks with potential buyers this month, including private equity firms, the sources said. There is no certainty that any deal will be reached, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Jack in the Box did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares rose 6.6 percent on the news to $89.14 on Thursday afternoon, giving it a market capitalization of $2.3 billion.
Jack in the Box has been grappling with decreased consumer demand for fast food, as well as with higher wages for its workers. 
It has been investing more in marketing and has updated its menu to include items such as the ""Cholula Buttery Jack"" and Teriyaki bowls. It beat revenue estimates in its two most recent earnings quarters, following a string of misses.
The company has also had to contend with dissatisfaction from its own operator base, the National Jack in the Box Franchisee Association, which last month demanded the company replace CEO Lenny Comma, saying the 2,240-outlet company's current strategy was harming its 2,000 franchise-owned restaurants.
Jack in the Box reached a settlement with activist hedge fund Jana Partners last month, agreeing to expand its board and give Jana a say over who fills two board seats. 

Earlier this year, Jack in the Box sold its Qdoba Restaurant Corp unit, which operates and franchises more than 700 Qdoba Mexican Eats restaurants, to private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) for about $305 million cash.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 03:56PM ET</span>","In Mexico, resistance to solar projects bodes badly for fast-tracking train","By Sheky Espejo and Noe Torres
SAN JOSÉ TIPCEH, Mexico (Reuters) - The Yucatan peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean, is among Mexico's top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate. Home to bustling tourist resorts such as Cancun, the area is also a big energy consumer. 
But some of its Mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of $1.1 billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line.
""In the communities, there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project,"" said Carlos Escoffié, lawyer for the Collective of Mayan Communities in the Chenes region.
In San Jose Tipceh, a town of 500 people surrounded by jungles, indigenous leaders delayed by 18 months a multi-million dollar renewable energy project by U.S.-based solar company SunPower Corp, which planned to begin operations in August. 
""We are practically selling our families for a little bit of money,"" said resident Damián Mugarte, threatening to take the battle to Mexico's highest court. 
Indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in southern Mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land. But the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike. 
Some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on, the issue has the potential to stall railways, ports, mines and other infrastructure projects. 
""If not fixed, the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth,"" said Hector Garza of international law firm Ritch Mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process. 
Rodolfo Salazar, who heads the consultation department for the current government at the Ministry of Energy, said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations. 
TRAIN ON TIME?
Left-leaning Lopez Obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights, a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns.
That may make it harder to build the Mayan Train, a 1,525-km (948-mile) railway planned in the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco and Chiapas, connecting the rainforest and the beach. 
It could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which Lopez Obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of Oaxaca.In an effort to win popular backing for the project, Lopez Obrador last week held a national referendum on the Mayan Train and nine other policy initiatives - including an oil refinery in the Gulf of Mexico - as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government decision-making during his six-year term. 
But the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results. Only around 950,000 people voted in the Nov. 24-25 consultation, representing just 1.1 percent of eligible voters. 
His first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built $13 billion airport for Mexico City - sending the peso currency and the stock market sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy. 
Although Lopez Obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the Mayan Train, he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office.
In Yucatan, activists say that none of the 163 communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project. 
The fear is that ""they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support, something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula,"" said Escoffié, of the Collective of Mayan Communities.
Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands.
Lopez Obrador has said that the train project, which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states, which remain less developed than the more industrialized north.
The train will provide easier access to key tourist sites, like the Mayan coastal ruins at Tulum and the famed complex at Chichen Itza. Lopez Obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years. 
VAGUE REGULATIONS
Indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across Mexico's southern states awarded in 2016 as part of President Enrique Pena Nieto's bid to generate more than a third of Mexico's electricity from renewable energy by 2024. 
Under existing law, projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead. 
But regulations are vague, and communities and international organizations including the United Nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly. 
The process has caused frustrations for investors. On the Oaxacan coast, an indigenous Zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by French state company EDF (PA:EDF) since April. 
EDF said the delays jeopardize its investments in Mexico. 
""How much can we stand?"" said Víctor Tamayo, EDF's regional director in Mexico. ""Much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is responsible.""
In San José Tipceh, SunPower's investment finally won approval in a consultation. The launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until September 2020. 

Many in the impoverished town - where most inhabitants work in agriculture, growing corn, lemons and tangerines - say the park will bring much-needed jobs. ""We are barely surviving here,"" complained Anastacio Ake, a 62-year-old evangelical pastor, saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street eked out gains Thursday, reversing the session's earlier losses after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its November meeting in which the central bank opened the debate on when to pause further interest rate hikes. 
All three major U.S. indexes were up modestly.
The minutes showed almost all Fed members agreeing that another rate increase was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon,"" but also ticked off a series of issues that had begun weighing on their view of the economy. 
Wall Street was lifted a day earlier by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, that many investors read as signaling the Fed's three-year tightening cycle is drawing to a close.
""The minutes seem to be consistent with Powell's statement yesterday that while a December rate hike seems almost certainly on the cards a review of policy is warranted before additional rate hikes will occur next year,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 103.51 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,469.94, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 9.46 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,753.25 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 27.87 points, or 0.38 percent, to 7,319.46.
The S&P 500 healthcare (SPXHC) and energy (SPNY) sectors led the benchmark index higher.
Gains were muted as investors eyed the upcoming G20 summit in Buenos Aires, where U.S. President Donald Trump was due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
Trump sent mixed signals on Thursday about a potential trade deal between the world's two largest economies.
Technology shares weighed the most on all three major U.S. stock indexes, with the S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) down 0.2 percent.
Interest rate-sensitive financials (SPNY) edged down 0.2 percent, as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) continued to fall after Powell's remarks.
Among large U.S. banks, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) were down between 0.5 and 1.2 percent.
A slew of data hinted at a slowdown in U.S. economic growth. The core PCE price index dropped below the Fed's 2 percent target to 1.8 percent, its lowest reading since February. New claims for unemployment insurance rose to a six-month high, and pending sales of existing homes plunged unexpectedly, falling 2.6 percent.
 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) dropped 4.2 percent after a Politico report that Fox News boycotted the social media network seemed to fuel worries over a wider backlash. 
 Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) rose 6.5 percent after the discount retailer said tariffs would have a minimal impact this year, its comments offsetting a same-store sales miss and a full-year forecast cut.
Shares of teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Finch Co (N:ANF) jumped 20.4 percent after forecasting better-than-expected holiday quarter sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Everywhere Reprice Rate Outlook as Growth Sputters,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s not just in the U.S. that confidence in higher interest rates is faltering. Bond and money market traders around the world are reassessing the pace of tightening amid signs global growth is sputtering.
Traders were cutting back bets on Federal Reserve hikes in 2019 even before dovish remarks from Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door for a potential pullback next year. Minutes from the Fed’s meeting earlier this month also set the stage for more flexibility. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank’s long-anticipated rate increase is looking less likely, while the probability of a move in Australia is continually being pushed back.
Central banks may have good reason to turn more dovish. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for world growth last month, and warned this week that the outlook may have gotten even worse. That’s been reflected in increasing financial market turbulence, with stocks sinking in the fourth quarter and credit spreads widening. Meanwhile, falling oil prices are taming inflation expectations.
Here’s how the slowing growth theme is seen playing out in each of the major markets, along with recommendations from strategists on possible ways to trade it.
U.S.: Don’t Fade the Fed
U.S. interest-rate pricing shows the market is expecting a 25 basis-point hike next month, and no more than one additional increase next year. That’s less than the consensus among analysts and below the Fed’s own forecasts.
“We’ve reached a tipping point in terms of how much rate hikes by the Fed can be tolerated,” said Yvette Klevan, fixed income portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management in New York. “In the U.S. we’re seeing the housing market roll over, mortgage rates touching 5 percent, and you’ve started to see equity markets correct and head south.” Klevan expects the Fed to pause after raising rates this December and March next year, with any further tightening being data dependent.
To be sure, U.S. growth is still running strong at present, and for those keeping the faith, it spells opportunity. There’s a low risk that the Fed will deviate from its path “over the next 2-3 hikes,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategist Zach Pandl wrote in the investment bank’s 2019 outlook published this month. He recommends betting the yield gap between two-year and 30-year U.S. Treasuries would narrow, a so-called flattener trade, as shorter-maturity yields are set to rise.
Europe: Ignoring Guidance
While the ECB has been clinging to guidance that rates will rise after the summer, weakening economic data are leaving markets increasingly doubtful. Overnight swap rates are only pricing in the first full 15 basis-point rate hike for March 2020.
The central bank won’t hike next year because macro risks and personnel changes will make the move difficult, NatWest Markets strategist James McCormick (NYSE:MKC) says. The company recommends a cocktail of long positions in the front-end, including a bet on forward Eonia rates and two-year German notes.
Not everyone has given up. A depressed mood and dovish ECB expectations mean there’s “fundamental asymmetry” in European rates, said Adam Kurpiel, head of rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. Expect a September rate hike and look at a variety of bearish conditional trades in option markets to capture this, he said.
Further north in Sweden, data today showed the economy surprisingly contracted in the third quarter, casting doubts over the central bank’s plan to raise rates as soon as next month. Rabobank this week lowered its forecast for the Norwegian krone, citing doubts about Norges Bank’s monetary policy, as well as lower oil prices.
Australia: Slow Progress
A cooling global economy is especially significant for Australia given the nation’s place in the global supply chain. Markets are giving around 50 percent chance of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the fourth quarter of next year, with a slowing housing market seen as the major obstacle.
As growth slows, there may be another year of stable RBA policy, Sally Auld, a senior strategist at JP Morgan Securities Australia Ltd. in Sydney, wrote in a client note. The company recommends going long Australian rates through receiving short-dated interest swaps versus the U.S.
Still, with unemployment falling, “the case for an RBA rate hike in 2019 is pretty compelling,” NatWest’s McCormick said. He recommended going long Australian dollars versus the Canadian and New Zealand currencies.
U.K.: Brexit Dominates
For the U.K., everything depends on the outcome of the vote to leave the European Union. The next 25 basis-point hike from the Bank of England isn’t fully priced in until February 2020, reflecting a hefty Brexit discount.
Strategists are optimistic. There is a consensus view that a hard Brexit will be avoided, allowing the BOE to gear up rate hikes earlier than priced. A variety of trades expressing this view are being recommended for 2019. McCormick recommends being short gilts and long sterling, while Societe Generale’s Kurpiel advises using swap rates to position for a steeper spread between 2-year and 5-year contracts.
Canada: A Little Crude
Rate hike odds in Canada have been trimmed as global oil prices slump, though with the nation’s economy closely tied to the prospects of its southern neighbor, markets are still primed for two 25 basis-point moves in 2019.
Declining commodity prices mean markets are now underpricing rate hikes as the Bank of Canada is likely to raise rates three times in 2019, says TD Securities Senior Canada Rates Strategist Andrew Kelvin. The bank recommends a variety of short positions in near-dated interest rates including positioning for a higher rate hike premium for the March 2019 BOC meeting and also in the fourth quarter.
Japan: Outside Chance of Hikes
Most strategists have ignored the front end of Japan’s interest-rate curve when making their predictions for next year, and with good reason. The gentle upward slope of the overnight rates curve shows minimal rate-hike expectations are priced in.
But some see the chance for some action here. The Bank of Japan will raise its short-term rate by 10 basis points to zero in April 2019 -– ending its negative interest-rate policy -- with a view to making the overall easing framework more sustainable,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) MUFJ strategists, including Koichi Sugisaki in Tokyo, wrote in a client note this week.
While 10-year rates may see upward pressure, the market is unlikely to price in a chance of additional hikes, he said.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists are also looking for a one-and-done hike from the central bank, with July as the most likely timing to pull trigger.
New Zealand: Milking It
Rising volatility in New Zealand’s markets has seen the chance of a rate cut next year ruled out and the prospects for a rate hike in early 2020 rise to around 50 percent.
Cross-market rates trades are the best way to position for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, according to National Australia Bank Ltd. “More rate-hike risk should be priced into New Zealand than the Australia curve” given the higher core inflation relative to target, writes Alex Stanley, a senior rates strategist in Sydney. Investors should look at five-year interest-rate swap wideners between New Zealand and Australia, he said.

1661,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Goldman Says Large-Cap Mutual Funds Are Losing Badly to Benchmarks,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). says the allure of mutual funds is fading as the year draws to close.
The percentage of large-cap mutual funds outperforming benchmarks has nearly halved to 33 percent from 63 percent in April. That’s been fueled by sector allocation, where overweights in cyclical groups like financials have hurt returns all year, and underweights in defensive shares have hurt during the recent market downturn.
“Although mutual fund overweights have provided some support to fund returns year-to-date, the most underweight mutual fund stocks have outpaced the most overweight positions” in the fourth quarter, Goldman strategists led by Arjun Menon and David Kostin wrote in a note published late Wednesday.
Not all investors are dissuaded. Active mutual funds are on pace to see their lowest outflows since 2014 and those will likely drop again in 2019, while flows to passive may be lowest in three years, the report said. In fact, demand for active management should continue to increase in 2019 given Goldman’s forecast of elevated risk and a “non-trivial” 30 percent probability of a decline of 10 percent or more in equity prices if the market begins to price in a recession, the strategists wrote.
“In an uncertain and volatile environment, the ability of active managers to reduce risk better positions them to outperform the market relative to index-tracking passive funds,” the strategists wrote. However, since Goldman’s economists don’t expect a recession in 2019, “the overall trend of passive inflows and active outflows should persist.”
Average allocation to the technology sector is at a five-year low after funds cut their relative weightings for the eighth time in the past nine quarters, the report said. Funds boosted exposure to health care and financials. Relative allocation to utilities and real estate is at five-year highs, though funds still remain underweight those groups.
Constituents with the largest overweights by mutual funds include  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V)., Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc., Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM). and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)., while most underweighted stocks include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., the report said."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) tumbled 6 percent on Thursday after reports that Fox News had not tweeted for three weeks sparked fears of a backlash by conservatives protesting a perceived liberal bias by the company.
Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) Fox News has not tweeted to its 18.3 million followers since Nov. 8, an apparent boycott of the social network, Politico reported on Wednesday.
It stopped tweeting after activists used Twitter to post the home address of prominent news host Tucker Carlson, media news site Mediaite reported on Nov. 9. Demonstrators targeted Carlson's home in Washington with a protest and shouted threats, he told the Washington Post.
Fox News and Twitter declined to comment.
Facebook (O:FB) and other social media networks are facing calls for increased regulation and criticism of their handling of user data and the role their platforms have played in a divisive U.S. political climate in recent years.
Still, analysts viewed Thursday's stock drop as an over-reaction.
""I think the people who want to be alarmist will say this is the first step toward losing the conservatives, and that this could snowball. But at this point, I think that's overly alarmist, and I don't see it as a big deal. So I see this as a buying opportunity,"" said FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi, who has an ""outperform"" rating on Twitter's stock.
Last month, Twitter posted quarterly results that far exceeded Wall Street's estimates even after it purged millions of fake accounts used for disinformation and other abuses.
Conservatives in the past have complained about having their accounts unfairly closed by Twitter, and about alleged political bias in the California company's rules.
Twitter this week reinstated the account of conservative commentator Jesse Kelly after U.S. Senator-elect Josh Hawley said that Congress should investigate the company after it closed Kelly's account, and the account of Canadian feminist Megan Murphy.

The company said on Wednesday that it had suspended an account for impersonating Russian President Vladimir Putin.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Elliott steps in to boost Arconic's sale process - sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp, the activist hedge fund that sits on Arconic Inc's (N:ARNC) board, is working to address potential liabilities weighing on the sale process for the U.S. aluminum products maker, according to people familiar with the matter.
Elliott's move comes after Arconic rejected an acquisition offer of more than $11 billion from Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) as inadequate. Elliott hopes its intervention can help Arconic fetch a higher price, the sources said on Thursday.
Arconic shares rose 3.3 percent to $21.51 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $10.4 billion. 
The potential legal liabilities stem from Arconic's building and construction systems division, which makes facades, windows and framing products. Its Reynobond PE panels were used in the cladding of the London's Grenfell Tower apartment complex, where more than 70 people were killed last year in a blaze.
Elliott has proposed a structure that would place liabilities of Arconic's cladding business in a separate entity, the sources said. The technique, called ringfencing, has been used by other industrial conglomerates seeking to limit exposure to similar legal claims, the sources added.
Elliott would also roll its 11 percent stake into the winning bid for the company, the sources said. This will allow Elliott to retain its equity in the company while other shareholders get cash.
Arconic has asked Apollo, as well as a buyout consortium led by Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) and  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), to now submit new offers for the company on Friday, the sources said. Arconic's board plans to meet next week to review the offers, one of the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Arconic, Blackstone and Carlyle did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Elliott and Apollo declined to comment.
A deal for Arconic would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year. It would come after U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of aluminum tariffs this year drove up some costs for Arconic, which makes aluminum components for cars and airplanes.
Arconic, which was spun out of  Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) in 2016, said in February it would carry out a ""strategy and portfolio review."" It said last month in its third-quarter earnings announcement that it was ""extending the scope and duration of this activity to address additional scenarios,"" and that it expected to complete its review in the fourth quarter.

Arconic reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit last month and raised its full-year earnings forecast, driven by higher demand for aluminum parts used by its airplane customers, including  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR).

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) President Dan Ammann will take over as chief executive of the automaker's majority-owned Cruise self-driving car subsidiary, trading in the No. 2 job at one of the world's largest automakers for a front-row position in the race to render traditional cars obsolete.
Ammann's move, announced by GM and Cruise on Thursday and effective Jan. 1, underscores the challenges for legacy automakers as they compete for capital and talent with transport companies born from the digital technology and artificial intelligence industries, such as rival Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), or Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). 
Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who has been the company's chief executive, will become president and chief technology officer, GM and Cruise said.
""The CEO title is not the most important thing to me or to the mission"" of developing safe, self-driving vehicles, Vogt said in an interview Thursday. 
Cruise has a value of about $14.6 billion - equivalent to about 28 percent of GM's market capitalization despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch. Japanese technology investment fund SoftBank Group Corp <9434.T> and Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co (T:7267) invested a total of $5 billion for separate minority stakes in Cruise.
Ammann joined GM in 2010 from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), where he was an adviser to GM's government-led bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. He became GM's president in 2014 and led a wide-ranging restructuring of global operations that included the sale of GM's European Opel unit, an overhaul of the money-losing GM Korea business and, in 2016, the acquisition of Cruise.
UNUSUAL MOVE
Bringing in an executive with experience managing large organizations and dealing with Wall Street to replace entrepreneurial founders is a common move in the technology industry.
However, it is unusual for a top executive at a global automaker to move to a small technology startup, even one as well-funded as Cruise. 
""The scaling of this business is going to be a massive undertaking,"" Ammann told Reuters.
Analysts have speculated that GM eventually will sell shares in Cruise or spin it off. Ammann said Cruise has the capital it needs for now. ""We'll have a lot of flexibility and different opportunities to raise capital,"" he said. 
Ammann, 46, will take over an operation that is growing rapidly and faces technical and regulatory hurdles to achieve its goal of launching a robo-taxi service by the end of 2019.
Vogt, 33, and Ammann reaffirmed the goal of launching an automated ride service next year. 
""From a technical standpoint ... we have line of sight to where we need to be for our initial launch in 2019,"" Vogt said. ""There's plenty of work to be done.""
Since GM's acquisition, San Francisco-based Cruise has grown to 1,000 employees from 40, and recently announced plans to expand operations to Seattle. Vogt and Ammann said they expect Cruise to grow substantially as it launches a robo-taxi service and other ventures built around its autonomous driving technology.
""Today no one has a car that can be driven by itself, better than a human and is producible at large scale,"" Ammann said. ""Once that exists ... we’re going to be in a very interesting position in terms of how we turn that into a business."" 
Cruise has focused on developing automated taxis for cities. GM has not said where Cruise will launch its robo-taxi service, but Ammann and other executives have noted that Cruise is doing most of its testing in San Francisco.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a statement, described Ammann's move as the ""next step towards commercial deployment.""
With Ammann moving to Cruise, GM said that executives running GM's global auto operations and its GM Financial unit will report to Barra. GM earlier this week announced plans to cut 15,000 employees in North America, including a 25-percent cut in executive ranks.

1673,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: Dollar Tree, Abercrombie Buck Bearish Day for Retailers","Investing.com - Dollar Tree and Abercrombie & Fitch rallied Thursday, even as a sea of red washed over retailers, keeping the broader consumer discretionary sector on the back foot.
Discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) soared 5%, shrugging off mixed third-quarter results as earnings and revenue topped estimates, but same-store sales and fourth-quarter guidance fell short.
Same-store sales rose 1% and were up 2.3% for Dollar Tree on a constant currency basis. But comparable sales for the Family Dollar brand were down by 0.4%.
The subdued sales print comes as the retailer struggles to stay popular in an e-commerce era where consumers favor clicks over bricks and turn to more upscale retailers like  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
Dollar Tree forecast fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $1.86 to $1.95, below consensus of $2.00. Fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $6.1 billion to $6.21 billion fell short of Wall Street estimates for $6.23 billion.
Abercrombie & Fitch's (NYSE:ANF) third-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines, underpinned by growth of its Hollister label, sending its shares 19% higher.
Same-store sales at Hollister were up 4%, while those at Abercrombie were up 1%, pushing same-store sales for the group 3% higher, topping Wall Street estimates for a 1.6% rise.
""We had a solid start to the holiday season,"" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a statement.
Elsewhere, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fell 0.5% even as Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the supermarket giant's e-commerce growth accelerated to 43% in the third quarter, outpacing that of e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)."

The two companies and Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) ""emphatically reiterated"" their commitment to the alliance, as executives met in Amsterdam for the first time since Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest over misconduct allegations.
But attempts by Renault to transfer Ghosn's chairmanship of the Renault-Nissan board to his French deputy Thierry Bollore appeared to have foundered.
There are no plans to name an interim alliance leader, Mitsubishi boss Osamu Masuko said afterwards. Instead, he said, leadership will be shared among the three companies' CEOs.
The crisis unleashed by Ghosn's arrest has deepened as Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa seeks to end 43.4 percent-owner Renault's grip on their alliance. Ghosn was swiftly ousted as Nissan chairman but remains at the helm of Renault.
Renault had named Bollore as deputy CEO with ""the same powers"" as Ghosn a day after his arrest - in a bid to maintain the continuity of its leadership of the alliance.
Under its 2002 master agreement, seen by Reuters, the alliance is chaired by the sitting chief executive of Renault, a post still held by Ghosn. Nissan's reciprocal a 15 percent stake in its French parent currently has no voting rights.
Changes to the alliance ownership structure were not discussed, Masuko said in Japan after joining the meeting by video link. Saikawa and Bollore also participated remotely.
Ghosn, 64, and alleged co-conspirator Greg Kelly, a fellow Nissan director, were arrested in Tokyo over financial misconduct allegations after a Nissan investigation sparked by a whistleblower. 

Both deny accusations that they under-reported Ghosn's compensation, misrepresented Nissan investments and made personal use of company funds.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>","Bayer to sell businesses, cut jobs after Monsanto deal","By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn), the German drugmaker that bought U.S. seed company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), announced on Thursday the sale of a number of businesses, around 12,000 job cuts and 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in impairments.
Chief Executive Werner Baumann is under pressure to boost Bayer's share price after a drop of more than 35 percent so far this year, dragged down by concern over more than 9,000 lawsuits it faces over an alleged cancer-causing effect of Monsanto's Roundup weed killer.
The group said it was looking at options - that could include a sale - for the Coppertone sunscreen and Dr. Scholl's foot care products from the consumer healthcare division it bought from Merck & Co (N:MRK) in 2014 for $14 billion.
It will also divest its animal health division, the number five player in the industry, which analysts have said could fetch 6-7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).
The unit, the largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs and a supplier of livestock veterinary drugs, had sales of 1.57 billion euros in 2017, accounting for about 4.5 percent of group revenues.
There has already been consolidation in animal health, with  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Eli Lilly (N:LLY), successfully floating their veterinary medicine units on the stock market as independent entities. 
Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis (N:ZTS), the former Pfizer unit, Elanco (N:ELAN), unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY), and drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK). 
Bayer will also seek a buyer for its 60-percent stake in German chemical production site services provider Currenta.
All three possible transactions were previously flagged by Reuters.
Its shares were down 0.8 percent in late trade. 
Markus Mayer, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s could fetch 1 billion euros and the Currenta stake could fetch 1.5 billion euros.
 Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) will likely be among the suitors for the consumer brands, said investment bankers, who asked not to be named.
JOB CUTS
Under a cost cutting program that will also target synergies expected from the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto, Bayer will cut around 12,000 of its 118,200 jobs worldwide.
At the Consumer Health and Pharmaceuticals divisions, Bayer will take about 3.3 billion euros in impairments and write-offs the fourth quarter.
Consumer Health brands acquired with the Merck & Co. and Dihon businesses will account for 2.7 billion euros of that, while about 600 million euros impairments and write-offs are due to a decision not to utilize a hemophilia drug factory in the German city of Wuppertal and to concentrate production in Berkeley, United States. 
The consumer healthcare unit, which sells non-prescription treatments, has faced falling revenues as U.S. consumers went from established drugstores to online shops, often switching to cheaper brands.
In the first nine months of 2018, Bayer consumer health products' sales declined by 0.4 percent when excluding currency swings, following a drop of 1.7 percent in the full year of 2017.
The company said it was targeting core earnings per share of 6.80 euros in 2019, up from an expected 5.70 to 5.90 euros this year, with a 2022 target of around 10 euros, when discounting the effect of currency swings and portfolio changes. 
The group's margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and special items over sales should increase to over 30 percent by 2022, up from 26.5 percent last year, it added.
